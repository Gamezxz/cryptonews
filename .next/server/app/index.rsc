f:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

Bitcoin price dropped nearly 8.6%, hovering near the $65,000 level, while Ethereum and major altcoins followed with sharp intraday losses. The intensity of the move points to more than routine profit-taking. With liquidations accelerating and sentiment collapsing into extreme fear, the ongoing crypto crash creates a dilemma among investors, one that forces traders and investors to confront a familiar question: Is this a buy-the-dip moment, or is patience still required? Liquidations Data Reveals Market Still Under Stress The key trigger of today’s crypto crash lies in derivatives data. More than $2.59 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most aggressive leverage flushes of the year. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the bulk of forced closures, while altcoins experienced cascading liquidations as price levels failed in quick succession. At the same time, total open interest fell 10.1% to $95.77 billion, confirming that leverage is being removed, not repositioned. Such conditions typically reflect instability rather than balance. Markets tend to struggle to form durable bottoms while liquidation velocity remains elevated. Sentiment Hits Extreme Fear, But Capitulation Is Incomplete The Crypto market Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, placing sentiment deep into Extreme Fear, a zone that historically precedes medium-term recoveries. However, structural signals remain mixed. Bitcoin exchange balances increased by 13,800 BTC, suggesting that selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself. Coins are still moving toward exchanges rather than being locked away by long-term holders. In previous market cycles, sustainable bottoms emerged after extreme fear persisted alongside declining exchange inflows, a condition that has not yet fully materialized. Bitcoin Price at $65K: A Decision Zone, Not a Confirmed Bottom Bitcoin’s drop toward the $65,000 region is now colliding with a signal that long-term market participants rarely ignore. The monthly stochastic oscillator has slipped into extreme oversold territory, a condition that has appeared only three times over the past decade. Each prior occurrence aligned with major bear market bottoms and the start of prolonged accumulation phases. However, history also shows this signal is not a timing trigger. In previous cycles, Bitcoin did not immediately reverse higher. Instead, price often spent weeks sometimes months moving sideways or making marginal new lows as leverage flushed out and sentiment reset. That dynamic matters today. While the long-term stochastic suggests downside may be structurally limited, short-term data still reflects stress. Open interest is falling, liquidations remain elevated, and exchange balances are rising, indicating that traders are still de-risking rather than rebuilding positions. In practical terms, this creates a split narrative. For long-horizon investors, conditions are beginning to resemble early accumulation zones. For short-term traders, volatility risk remains high until liquidation pressure eases and price stabilizes above key support. The signal argues that Bitcoin may be closer to a bottom than a top, but confirmation will require patience, not prediction. Final Thoughts: Right Time to Buy or Wait? The broader crypto market is showing classic stress signals, not clear bottoming behavior. Extreme fear readings, multi-billion-dollar liquidations, and declining open interest suggest forced deleveraging is still working its way through the system. While some assets are showing relative strength and selective accumulation, this looks more like rotation and positioning not a broad-based recovery. Historically, durable market bottoms form after volatility compresses and sellers exhaust, not during peak liquidation phases. Right now, liquidity is thin and confidence remains fragile, leaving room for further downside or prolonged consolidation. This is not a clear “buy the dip” moment for the overall market. Caution and patience are still the better strategy, with selective accumulation only where strong fundamentals and on-chain support clearly justify it.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) also suffers the same fate, dipping to the $0.000005 price level. According to CoinGecko data, SHIB’s price is down 9.2% in the last 24 hours , 17.7% in the last week, nearly 26% in the 14-day charts, and 34.7% over the previous month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are distraught, wondering if the asset’s price is at its bottom, or will it crash further. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Is Shiba Inu’s Price At Its Bottom, Or Is More Bad News On The Way? Source: WatcherGuru Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at levels last seen in July 2021. Investors are sitting on heavy losses, especially those who bought the asset at the top. SHIB’s price is currently following Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory, and may not rebound until the original crypto registers some positive price action. Some analysts anticipate BTC to fall further. Stifel anticipates BTC’s price to dip to the $38,000 level. BTC falling to $38,000 could pull Shiba Inu (SHIB) further down. However, the market seems to be making a slight rebound today. Although the rebound may see a rejection, it could also signal a bottom. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently hangs on a thread. The market-wide crash comes amid tighter Federal Reserve policies and a shrinking liquidity crisis. Macroeconomic worries and geopolitical tensions have added further fuel to the fire. Additionally, market participants took a risk-off approach with their investments. Shiba Inu (SHIB) being a memecoin carries some of the highest risks in the market. Memecoins will likely take much longer to recover than other cryptocurrencies. Also Read: New Shiba Inu Price Prediction Says SHIB May Hit $0.0004: Here’s When Given the uncertain environment and the bearishness that looms over the market, it is unclear if Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at its bottom, or if the asset’s price sill fall further. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) does not recover from its depths, SHIB will likely face additional sell pressure.12:Tcf1,Millions and millions of PI tokens will be released in the following weeks, which could bring even more pain for the bulls. The past several weeks have not been kind to the cryptocurrency markets. This trend only intensified on Thursday when the entire market bled out, with multiple double-digit price crashers. Naturally, Pi Network’s PI token was not spared, and it dumped to fresh all-time lows of under $0.135 (on CoinGecko). This meant that the asset has plunged by over 30% in the last month alone. On a broader scale, PI is down by more than 95% since its all-time high marked on February 26, 2025. Despite this massive correction, some members of the ever-vocal and optimistic Pi Network community tried to find the silver linings. This one, for example, outlined the skyrocketing PI transaction volume, which, he believes, shows “increased interest in PI despite the manipulation games done by whales.” This one was even more bullish, predicting a mind-blowing surge to $4 from the current dip in the first six months after the second Mainnet migration and once old Pioneers (Pi Network users and investors) are done selling off. More Pain to Come? If we are being realistic, it’s hard to even imagine such a rally happening soon. Not only because the overall crypto market seems to be dominated by the bears, but also due to PI’s recent price performance and the unlocking schedule for new tokens. Data from PiScan shows that almost 8 million coins will be freed in the next month on average. What’s even more worrying is the fact that this number will skyrocket to over 18 million on February 12 and to 23.6 million on February 13. Such a massive number of tokens to be unlocked might result in more immediate selling pressure from investors who have been waiting a long time for their holdings to become available for trading. This is particularly true in such a time of panic. You may also like: Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Before the FOMC Meeting, Pi Network (PI) Soars by 15%: Market Watch Pi Token Unlock Schedule. Source: PiScan The Good News On the positive side, the chart above demonstrates that the number of unlocked tokens will decline after February 20 and will normalize, which could ease the selling pressure. Additionally, there are rumors circulating online that one of the largest and oldest exchanges, Kraken, might be planning to list Pi Network’s native token, which could boost its liquidity and legitimacy among investors. 🚨 BREAKING: Kraken Exchange is preparing to integrate the Pi blockchain and list $PI for trading 👀 If confirmed, this could be a major step for Pi ecosystem adoption. ⁰Eyes on what comes next. #PiNetwork #PI #Kraken #CryptoNews #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/BAWZLcGQnH — SMC KAPIL DEV (@smckapildev) February 6, 2026 SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer).

Feb 6, 2026, 10:21 a.m. Quantum computing is moving from theory to long term strategic consideration, and Strategy (MSTR) has made it clear it intends to be proactive rather than reactive during the company's Q4 earnings call on Thursday. Strategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, plans to initiate a bitcoin security program to coordinate with the global cyber, crypto, and bitcoin security community. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The company addressed growing discussion around quantum risk and reaffirmed its commitment to bitcoin security, framing quantum not as an immediate threat but as a future engineering challenge the network can prepare for. Strategy reported a net loss of $12.4 billion for the quarter. Shares fell 17% on the day, trading as low as $104, but market focus quickly shifted to executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commentary. Saylor revisited a long list of historical Bitcoin FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that the network has already overcome quantum concerns, while acknowledging that quantum deserves serious long term planning. The company outlined a range of key points on quantum computing, predicting that quantum technology is likely more than a decade away and pointing out that the Bitcoin community is already researching quantum-resistant cryptography. Shares are up 6% in pre-market trading as bitcoin has rebounded to $65,000.

On Friday, Vyper said core parts of its product will begin shutting down on Feb. 10, while limited functions will remain accessible. Users were directed to Pump.fun’s Terminal (formerly Padre) to continue using the tools. The move reflects a broader strategy by Pump.fun to consolidate more of the trading workflow, from token launches to execution and analytics, as memecoin activity cools from the speculative frenzy of late 2024 and early 2025. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Pump.fun did not respond to Cointelegraph before publication. Expansion beyond token launches Pump.fun’s acquisition of Vyper follows earlier moves into trading infrastructure. On Oct. 24, Pump.fun acquired trading terminal Padre to strengthen liquidity and improve execution for tokens launched on its platform. Padre was later rebranded and now operates as Terminal. In January, Pump.fun also launched an investment arm called Pump Fund, marking what the company described as a pivot away from a pure memecoin focus. On Jan. 20, Pump Fund debuted alongside a $3 million hackathon aimed at backing early-stage projects, including those not directly related to crypto. Related: MEV trading returns to court in Pump.fun class-action lawsuit Consolidation amid a cooling memecoin market The expansion comes as memecoin activity fell from their peaks, when celebrities and several government leaders launched their own tokens . Pump.fun’s growth was driven by intense speculative activity on Solana, but revenue has since fallen as the popularity of memecoins weakened. Data from DefiLlama shows that Pump.fun’s monthly revenue peaked at more than $137 million in January 2025.

The -88% XRP collapse scenario first raised by U.Today on Jan. 20 is no longer theoretical. After losing the crucial $1.88 Bollinger Band midline, XRP crashed 41% to a low of $1.121. The monthly chart structure has now entered confirmed breakdown territory, with historical parallels pointing toward $0.33 or even $0.20 as valid targets. Unless bulls reclaim the $1.60 zone with volume, each failed monthly close reinforces the magnet effect toward the lower band. What was once dismissed as an absurd scenario is now unfolding step by step on the chart — with the next phase dependent on whether XRP will go for $1 . XRP/USD by TradingView No more than 17 days ago, on Jan. 20, a shocking U.Today forecast warned that XRP could collapse to $0.20 if the $1.88 Bollinger Band midline were to fail. Two weeks later and $5 billion of liquidations after, that scenario is no longer hypothetical. HOT Stories XRP has already lost over 41% since that alert, plunging to $1.121 in the last 24 hours before bouncing weakly. Worse — February’s candle opened and dropped directly below it without even a wick retest. In technical terms, this is a close confirmation of what many chartists dread: a full-band collapse setup. Is it time to worry about XRP price? The last time XRP closed the month below the Bollinger midline after a multimonth rally was in 2018. What followed was a two-year price suppression. The current downside magnet? The lower band, sitting near $0.336. If February closes below $1.60 and fails to reclaim the midband with volume, the main expectation is a gradual bleed into the $1 zone. Out there, a breakdown below $0.99 will open the corridor toward the full -88% target for XRP, represented visually by the Bollinger Bands . You Might Also Like Those placing breakout bets since the November 2024 liftoff must now reevaluate. Every monthly candle closing below $1.918 strengthens the validity of the $0.20 magnet. As of now, the -88% collapse is not absurd, and the next checkpoints are clear too: a $1.60 retest or $1 breakdown. Either way, XRP has lost its bullish protection level .17:Te28,Bitcoin ( BTC ) liquidated billions of dollars going into Friday as BTC price action set bearish records.

According to the earnings call held on the 5 February, the firm reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion in Q4 2025. Due to new reporting guidance, the entire loss was primarily an unrealized loss on its BTC holdings as the crypto rout intensified in late 2025 following October’s crash. Part of the report read, “Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2025 includes an unrealized loss on the Company’s digital assets of $17.4 billion. This is the fourth quarterly reporting period in which we have applied fair value accounting.” When adjusted for other incomes and expenses, the net loss for Q4 came down to $12.4 billion. Bitcoin bet weighs on Strategy The pioneer of corporate BTC treasury accumulated 713,502 coins at a cost of over $54 billion with an average price of $76k per BTC. Although this isn’t the firm’s bear market, the bet has recorded massive paper losses as BTC plunged below $65k on the charts. At press time, Strategy’s stash was worth $46.2 billion – Nearly 15% down after an $8 billion wipeout.

That’s not all either as its common stock, MSTR, has also not been spared from the market carnage. MSTR extends losses to 80% On Thursday, MSTR posted a 17% price decline after the earnings call and BTC’s sharp drop to $60k. This brought its losses, since the 2025 high of $453, to 76%.

At press time, MSTR was back to its 2024 price range of $100-$180. However, it remains to be seen whether the support will hold against bears. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff, a long-time BTC and Saylor critic, slammed the firm as a “fraud” and a “ponzi scheme.” He questioned Strategy’s capital-raising model for its BTC buys. In the past too, Schiff has taken advantage of BTC market routs to intensify attacks against the firm and Saylor. Final Thoughts Strategy reported a $17.4 billion loss in Q4, mainly due to a decline in BTC’s price which affected its unrealized PnL (profit and loss). Deepening market rout extended MSTR losses to 80% after dropping to the 2024 price range of $100-$180.19:Tffc,In brief Crypto leaders rebuked Democrats after the party’s official X account posted “yikes” with a crypto crash graphic, calling it insensitive to investor losses across party lines. The backlash came as over $2.6B in positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with Bitcoin down 8% to $64,752. Executives and policy advocates warned that partisan mockery of market pain could hurt Democrats with crypto voters, as digital asset legislation advances before midterms. Crypto industry leaders fired back at Democrats on Friday after the party's official X account posted "yikes" alongside a graphic mocking crypto market losses, drawing accusations of partisan insensitivity as Bitcoin plunged and investors lost billions. The Democratic Party's tweet featured a chart showing Bitcoin's slide alongside an image of President Donald Trump wearing a MAGA hat, triggering immediate backlash from executives, lawyers, and government advisors who said the message dismissed widespread financial pain affecting investors across party lines. The controversial social media activity came as Bitcoin dropped 8.1% over the past 24 hours to $65,729, down 33.1% from a year earlier, according to CoinGecko data . "The sad thing about this tweet is that you're gloating in a lot of Democrats' painful financial losses right now," Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long replied to the post. "You do know that many Democrats own crypto too, right?" The crypto market saw some $2.6 billion in liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $2.13 billion coming from long positions, according to Coinglass data . Bitcoin led liquidations with $1.35 billion, including $1.1 billion from long positions, while Ethereum saw $443 million in long positions liquidated. A partisan issue? The dispute shows rising partisan tension around crypto policy, with industry voices cautioning that mocking market pain could alienate pro-crypto voters. "Probably not the message you want to be sending to the crypto community before midterms,” Patrick Witt, Executive Director of the President's Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, responded to the Democrats’ tweet. Meanwhile, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss quoted the post , saying, "It was always political persecution." Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton, who is currently running for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, connected the losses to broader economic mismanagement by both parties. "If career politicians from both parties didn't cause a $38T debt by running $2T annual deficits for decades, recklessly creating money out of thin air, devaluing our currency to the point inflation has priced regular people out of the economy—maybe they wouldn't turn to crypto to build wealth," he wrote. Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci called the Democrat post a "stupid tweet," saying “the best thing Trump has going for him is the incompetence of Democrats on this topic." Democrats vs Trump The Democrats’ post followed a tweet from California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office, which said, "Trump is crashing the crypto markets faster than he'd crash an Epstein party," further inflaming partisan tensions around crypto. In December, Newsom launched a website tracking what he called Trump's "criminal cronies," spotlighting pardoned crypto figures including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht . On Wednesday, Representative Ro Khanna launched an investigation into a $500 million UAE investment in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's crypto company, questioning whether the deal influenced U.S. policy on AI chip exports. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has repeatedly warned about Trump's conflicts of interest in crypto, noting the family has amassed over $1.2 billion in financial gains from digital assets since his second term began, while also opposing proposals to allow crypto in 401(k) retirement plans.

As prices dropped nearly 10% to around $64,000, Bitcoin hit its lowest level since late 2024. This sharp move pushed many investors to sell their holdings at a loss. Record Losses in a Single Day February 5 stood out as a major stress point for the market. On-chain analyst Murphy reported that realized losses reached about $3.2 billion in just one day—the highest daily total ever recorded. Realized losses reflect how much money investors actually lose when they sell below their buying price, making this a strong sign of panic selling. Murphy noted that this single-day loss was even larger than what was seen during major past crises, including the Terra-Luna collapse and the FTX bankruptcy . This highlights how severe and sudden the latest sell-off has been. Low Liquidity Made the Drop Worse The Kobeissi Letter added that the decline was not driven by fear alone. It also exposed weak market liquidity. Bitcoin’s market depth, the amount of money available to absorb large trades, is still more than 30% lower than its October high. With fewer buyers at key price levels, even moderate selling can cause sharp price drops. The last time market depth was this low was after the FTX collapse in 2022, showing that the market remains fragile during periods of heavy selling. No Clear Trigger Behind the Sell-Off Unlike previous crashes caused by major news events, this downturn did not have one obvious trigger. Murphy said that aside from a data adjustment issue in late 2025, the current loss numbers reflect real selling pressure. He also defended using dollar-based loss data, saying it better shows the financial and emotional stress investors feel during sharp declines. Extreme Price Volatility The Kobeissi Letter also pointed out another first: Bitcoin recorded a single-day drop of more than $10,000. Even during earlier high-liquidation events, prices did not fall this much in one day. This has led to speculation that a large leveraged trader was forced to exit, which likely accelerated the fall and exposed how risky large positions can be. How Much Lower Can Bitcoin Go? Crypto researcher Sherlock highlighted a long-term pattern in Bitcoin’s history. Each bear market has resulted in smaller losses than the previous one, as the asset has matured. Bitcoin fell about 93% in 2011 and around 77% in 2022. If this trend continues, the current cycle could see a drop of roughly 70% from the $126,000 peak, pointing to a possible bottom near $38,000. This outlook suggests that while the recent sell-off has been painful, it may not be the final low and a quick recovery should not be taken for granted. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin is down due to low market liquidity and forced selling from leveraged positions. With fewer buyers, sell orders moved prices sharply lower. How big were the losses in the recent Bitcoin sell-off? On February 5, investors realized losses of roughly $3.2 billion in a single day—the highest daily loss ever recorded, exceeding losses seen during the Terra-Luna and FTX collapses. Could Bitcoin’s price drop further from here? Based on historical bear market patterns, Bitcoin could potentially fall around 70% from its $126,000 peak, suggesting a possible bottom near $38,000, though market conditions remain fluid. Was there a specific event that caused Bitcoin’s latest sell-off? No single news event triggered it. The drop appears driven by market structure, leverage unwinding, and fragile liquidity conditions.

ETH price has dropped significantly, slipping below $2K as the latest crypto market dumps took over the sector, wiping away trillions in their wake. This development is now impacting major crypto coins, with the Ethereum price taking a major hit in the middle. The token is down 9% in the last 24 hours, noting a 40% decline in its price in the last month. But is there more to ETH’s price? Will it crash even more than predicted price thresholds? Let’s find out. Also Read: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Dumps $6.6 Million Worth of ETH Ethereum Price Narratives: What Is Up With The Asset? Source: Decrypt Ethereum has fallen 40% in the last month, down significantly from its earlier ATH of $4K. The token is expected to have sharp volatility as of late, with its momentum hitting new roadblocks each day. The token is now sitting at $1.9K, showing a wobbly road ahead, as markets try their best to regain their lost footing. Despite the buildable pressure on the asset, experts are stating that Ethereum may ultimately come out stronger than ever, with the tokenization elements involved keeping the asset afloat and steady in the long run. The latest ETH fall is a result of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, selling 16,384 ETH, causing a temporary market mayhem. Buterin reportedly is selling ETH to solidify future plans for Ethereum, including robusting its stack software and hardware. “If you’re wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH. He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware.

If the markets stabilize soon, then the token can pick up pace, hitting $2k to ultimately claim the $3.9k mark by 2030.

Vitalik Flouts New Roadmap as Price Drops1c:Tc34,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 The cryptocurrency market extended its decline, with total capitalization falling to $2.2 trillion. Altcoins, particularly Solana [SOL], suffered steep losses. Solana dropped 15%, breaking below $70 and hitting a two‑year low of $67 before rebounding slightly to $81.6. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $80.78, down 10.44% on the daily charts. At the same time, its market capitalization fell below $50 billion, indicating substantial capital outflows. Solana whale fully liquidated amid market dip Amid this downside volatility, whale investors in the futures market, especially those taking long positions, experienced forced liquidations. According to Onchain Lens, a whale got completely liquidated on its SOL long position, losing $6.7 million. Overall, the whale lost over $16 million during the current market decline. Significantly, this whale is not an isolated case. In fact, over $167 million in long positions were liquidated between February 5 and 6. Source: CoinGlass Usually, forced selling exerts immediate selling pressure on the market, further accelerating the asset’s downward momentum. Thus, these liquidations exacerbated market stress, causing Solana to decline further, particularly given the current market weakness. However, in response to this liquidation threat, investors have changed strategy and increased short positions. According to CoinGlass data, the Long Short ratio fell below 1 to 0.96 at press time. Source: CoinGlass A ratio below 1 indicates that most traders across all exchanges have taken short positions, anticipating further losses. However, Binance and OKX remain among the top traders, with the Long-Short ratio averaging 3.0. Is SOL’s bottom in yet? Solana declined further as forced selling in futures markets created additional selling pressure on an already weakened market structure. At the same time, the altcoin jumped back above $80, as investors took the slip below $70 as an opportunity to buy the dip on the spot. Source: CoinGlass As such, the altcoin’s Netflow dropped to November 2025 levels, falling to -$101 million on the 5th of February. Notably, over $7 billion worth of SOL flowed out of exchanges, a clear sign of aggressive spot accumulation. Despite this, the purchases have remained insufficient to offset market conditions, and sellers have retained complete control. In fact, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell deeper into the oversold zone, dropping to 21 as of writing. Source: TradingView With momentum indicators dropping to such a level, this suggested strong downward momentum, with buyers entirely displaced. Equally, it indicated a potential continuation of the prevailing trend. Therefore, if these conditions persist, SOL could drop again below $70. For a trend reversal, buyers must keep up and reclaim the altcoin’s Parabolic SAR at $103. Final Thoughts Solana crashed to a 2-year low of $65 before rebounding to a high of $81. Solana whale was fully liquidated on its Sol long positions, resulting in $6.7 million in losses and raising total losses to $16 million.1d:T416,Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported a staggering $12.6 billion quarterly loss, primarily due to unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings as the cryptocurrency's price fell below the company's average acquisition cost. The sharp Bitcoin decline from approximately $73,100 to $62,400 during the quarter erased what were recently more than $30 billion in paper profits, highlighting the deep connection between the company's financial performance and crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business.

As the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 713,000 BTC, Strategy's stock has plummeted over 70% in the past year. Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor maintains a "HODL" strategy, while other companies like BitMine face similar unrealized losses on their Ethereum holdings. Analysts remind that Bitcoin's volatility is characteristic of its history, and long-term investors continue to focus on scarcity and long-term growth potential despite short-term price fluctuations.1e:Tac0,บริษัท Strategy (เดิมชื่อ MicroStrategy) รายงานขาดทุนไตรมาสที่น่าตกใจมูลค่า 12.6 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่มาจากขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นจริงในสินทรัพย์ Bitcoin เนื่องจากราคาสกุลเงินดิจิทัลลดลงต่ำกว่าราคาซื้อเฉลี่ยของบริษัท การร่วงลงของ Bitcoin จากระดับประมาณ 73,100 ดอลลาร์เป็น 62,400 ดอลลาร์ในไตรมาสนี้ ทำให้กำไรบนกระดาษที่เคยมีมากกว่า 30 พันล้านดอลลาร์เมื่อเร็วๆ นี้หายไป ซึ่งสะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความสัมพันธ์ที่ลึกซึ้งระหว่างผลการดำเนินงานทางการเงินของบริษัทกับการเคลื่อนไหวของตลาดคริปโตมากกว่าธุรกิจซอฟต์แวร์พื้นฐาน

ในฐานะผู้ถือครอง Bitcoin รายใหญ่ที่สุดในโลกด้วยจำนวนกว่า 713,000 BTC หุ้นของ Strategy ได้ร่วงลงมากกว่า 70% ในช่วงปีที่ผ่านมา แม้จะขาดทุนเป็นประวัติการณ์ ประธานกรรมการบริหาร ไมเคิล เซลเลอร์ ยังคงยึดมั่นในกลยุทธ์ "HODL" ในขณะที่บริษัทอื่นๆ เช่น BitMine ก็เผชิญกับขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นจริงในสินทรัพย์ Ethereum เช่นกัน นักวิเคราะห์เตือนว่าความผันผวนของ Bitcoin เป็นลักษณะประจำในประวัติศาสตร์ของมัน และนักลงทุนระยะยาวยังคงมุ่งเน้นที่ความหายากและศักยภาพการเติบโตในระยะยาว แม้จะเผชิญกับความผันผวนของราคาในระยะสั้น1f:T1505,Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has reported a staggering fourth-quarter net loss of roughly $12.6 billion, ranking among the largest quarterly losses ever recorded by a U.S. public company. The hit was driven almost entirely by unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings, underscoring how deeply the firm’s balance sheet is tied to crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business. Crypto Market Crash Erases Billions in Paper Gains The loss followed one of Bitcoin’s sharpest drawdowns in recent history . During the quarter, Bitcoin plunged nearly 15% intraday, sliding from around $73,100 to a low of $62,400. This move pushed Bitcoin below Strategy’s average acquisition price of roughly $76,000, flipping the firm’s position from massive unrealized gains into deep losses. Just a few months earlier, Strategy was sitting on more than $30 billion in paper profits when Bitcoin surged to record highs. Strategy Stock Feels the Pressure The market reaction was swift. Strategy shares dropped sharply after the earnings release and continued falling in after-hours trading. Over the past year, the stock has been down more than 70%, erasing much of the premium investors once assigned to the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since its November 2024 peak, the stock is now down nearly 80%, highlighting how quickly sentiment has turned. Bitcoin Exposure Magnifies Financial Impact Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, with more than 713,000 BTC on its balance sheet as of early February. Much of this position was accumulated during the late-2024 bull run, when Bitcoin briefly climbed above $120,000. With prices now well below those levels, unrealized losses have ballooned, making quarterly results highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s volatility. Saylor Stays Defiant as Critics Circle Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor showed no sign of wavering, posting a brief “HODL” message on X. However, critics have grown louder. Investors like Michael Burry have warned that sustained declines in Bitcoin could trigger cascading losses for corporate holders, reviving long-standing concerns around leverage and exposure to non-yielding assets. Ethereum Slide Hits BitMine Too Strategy is not alone. BitMine Immersion Technologies is facing roughly $8.2 billion in unrealized losses after Ethereum slipped to around $1,930, well below its average purchase price of $3,826. The company holds about 4.29 million ETH but has cushioned the blow by staking over 2.9 million ETH, generating around $188 million in annual yield, while maintaining strong cash reserves and no debt. Volatility, Not Failure Amid the turmoil, Anthony Pompliano offered a broader perspective, arguing that Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a flaw. He pointed out that repeated 50–85% drawdowns have defined Bitcoin’s history, yet the network has continued to operate flawlessly for over a decade. While critics celebrate downturns, long-term holders remain focused on scarcity, betting that short-term pain is temporary in Bitcoin’s long-term growth story. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own, and why does it matter? MicroStrategy holds over 713,000 Bitcoin, making it the world’s largest corporate holder. This massive stake makes its financial results extremely sensitive to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Did MicroStrategy sell its Bitcoin after the loss? No. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor signaled a continued “HODL” strategy, indicating the company does not plan to sell its Bitcoin despite the paper losses. Are other companies facing similar crypto losses? Yes. For example, BitMine faces about $8.2 billion in unrealized losses on its Ethereum holdings, though it offsets some risk through staking rewards and strong cash reserves. Is Bitcoin’s volatility a sign it’s failing? No. Analysts note Bitcoin’s history is defined by large drawdowns, yet the network operates flawlessly. Long-term investors view volatility as a temporary feature of its long-term growth story.

The move was backed by over $2 billion in long liquidations , wiping out more than $380 billion from the total crypto market capitalization. In contrast, the Decred (DCR) price has shown strong relative strength. The token surged over 30%, reaching levels above $24.65in the past few hours, even as market sentiment remained weak. The rally appears driven by a clean technical breakout, placing DCR among the top-performing assets over the past seven days. Price has moved above the key resistance zone between $22.17 and $23.40, a range that previously capped upside attempts. A daily close above this zone would likely validate bullish continuation toward the next target near $30. The key question now is whether DCR can maintain momentum and continue decoupling from the broader bearish market structure. Following the breakout, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, pointing to rising volatility as buying activity picks up. At the same time, On-Balance Volume (OBV) has moved sharply higher, indicating that more volume is flowing in on up-moves than on declines—often a sign of accumulation rather than short-term speculation. With demand building alongside improving volume structure, DCR appears positioned for a potential move toward the $30 level. However, for this bullish setup to remain valid, the price needs to secure a daily close above the immediate resistance zone between $22.12 and $23.51. Failure to do so could delay further upside and keep the Decred (DCR) price vulnerable to short-term pullbacks.

Crypto analyst Nathan Sloan of Investing Made Simple laid out the key levels to watch and why the 4-year cycle suggests this crash may follow a familiar pattern. After failing to reclaim $100,000, which flipped from support to resistance, Bitcoin flushed down past $70,000 and is currently trading around $65,845 . But this sell-off isn’t limited to crypto. Gold is correcting sharply, silver dropped 10% in a single day, and the NASDAQ is pulling back as well. Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Points to a Familiar Pattern Sloan highlighted that averaging the 2017 and 2021 cycle tops closely predicted the exact market top this cycle. That makes the 4-year cycle harder to dismiss as a coincidence. Bitcoin has now posted five consecutive red months since October. That has only happened once before, during the 2018 bear market, which saw six in a row. A relief rally is statistically overdue since Bitcoin has never posted more than six consecutive negative months. Historically, cycle bottoms have landed around October. Bitcoin Buying Levels to Watch Sloan outlined four price zones he considers important. The $70,000 level, the previous all-time high from the 2021 cycle, has already been broken. Bitcoin is now trading well below what Sloan considers a strong long-term entry zone. The $63,000 level, now less than 4% below current prices, would mark a 50% drawdown from the all-time high. At that level, simply returning to the prior high would mean a 2x return. The 200-week moving average sits just below $60,000 and is rising. Sloan flagged this as a historically reliable level. Every major crypto crash has either touched or broken below this line before recovering. “If you can get in between 60 and 70, if you can ignore all the pain and the fear over the next 3 to 6 months, you’ll likely do very, very well,” he said. Fed Policy Could Decide What Happens Next Sloan sees monetary policy as the strongest macro correlator for crypto. He compared the current setup to 2019, the last time the Fed pivoted, which saw a roughly 53% drawdown before recovery. Also Read: Trump’s New Fed Chair Kevin Warsh Could Cut Rates “Aggressively”, Says Analyst His personal plan is to buy back in around the $63,000 level within the next month or two, accepting the risk of being early. “The only downside for me is that I might be too early. So yes, Bitcoin could go sideways for months. It could even come down a little bit more,” he said.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction 2026 is becoming increasingly bullish as the 2025’s second half comes to a close soon, with all-time highs of $125K reached this year as the highest point. As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop. The year was marked by optimism, driven by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, skyrocketing institutional adoption, clearer regulations, and unwavering political support. There were several macro downturns, too, that capped BTC’s uptrend, like trade tariffs and wars. Despite that, BTC holds its level, making it now seen as “a hedge against inflation” more than ever. Major players, including MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and several other entities, are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. The market enthusiasm is at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction 2026 – 2030 dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. Coinpedia’s BTC Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, Bitcoin faced constant resistance, leading to a decline. By early February, it fell below the 200-day EMA, and now approaching $65K. If it drops below that, it may reach $53K in Q1 2026. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $60,074.20 and $71,584.86 today. Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $65,545.2449 -8.06% Market Cap $ 1,309,927,617,728.46 24h Volume $ 145,126,686,163.65 Circulating Supply 19,985,090.00 Total Supply 19,985,090.00 All-Time High $ 126,198.0696 on 06 October 2025 All-Time Low $ 0.0486 on 14 July 2010 On February 5, 2026, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply below $70,000, marking its lowest point in 15 months. This decline is due to a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets, large-scale liquidations of leveraged positions, and reduced institutional demand. The market reacted to the potential appointment of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair, leading to expectations of tighter monetary policy and a larger U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which increased above 97.5, lessening the attractiveness of riskier assets like Bitcoin. This situation triggered forced liquidations and a decline in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 11, signaling “Extreme Fear” among investors. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin cannot hold the $65,000 support level, it may drop further, potentially reaching targets of $60,000 or lower. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, the Bitcoin price retested the lower border of the ascending wedge pattern as resistance, with a slight bullish attempt that proved to be a fakeout, leading to a deeper decline. This is exactly witnessed in January when the fall worsened to $80738 January end,and early February even penetrated the 200-day EMA band and is approaching $65Ksupport area. Itis expected that if BTC/USD doesn’t take support and keeps falling, then odds suggest that beneath $65K, the Q1 2026 could see price falling towards $53K. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2026 $60,000-$95,000 $100,000 – $108,000 $115,000 – $118,000 Bitcoin Price On-chain Outlook The on-chain data has showed strong accumulation in 2025 and sustained declines in exchange reserves. Crucially, this confirms the elevated institutional commitment, which is evident even in the US Spot ETFs data figures and the corporate adoption also reinforces this trend, with public company holdings nearly doubling since the start of the year. Ultimately, a Bitcoin price prediction 2025 suggests that the future potential depends strictly on how sustained buying demand remains, as well as geopolitical stability and regulatory clarity. If the current bullish sentiment persists, the BTC price is expected to reach a cycle high target of $150,000. Conversely, should global uncertainty intensify and sentiment turn negative, the downside risk is projected to find strong support around the $70,000 mark.

Feb 6, 2026, 9:52 a.m. The U.S. jobs market is cooling fast, a timely blow that could force the Federal Reserve to loosen its purse strings and potentially put a floor under the price of bitcoin BTC $65,835.49 . Planned layoffs, the job cuts that companies have announced but not yet executed, surged by 205% to 108,435 in January, according to data tracked by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That's the highest reading since January 2009, months after Lehman Brothers collapsed and pushed the global economy into recession. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Year-on-year, the announced cuts rose 118%, indicating a sharp weakening in the labor market in the first year of Donald Trump's second stint as president. The technology industry announced 22,291 reductions, with Amazon (AMZN) accounting for most, while United Parcel Service (UPS) announced 31,243 planned cuts. Andy Challenger, workplace expert at Challenger, Grey & Christmas, called it a high figure for January, in any case a seasonally weak month for hiring. "It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026," Challenger said. This data clashes with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly payrolls report, which still paints a resilient labor market picture. Private reports are increasingly becoming early warning flags, signaling cracks forming before the official figures. Earlier this month, the blockchain-based Truflation showed a precipitous drop in real-time inflation, to under 1%, even as the official CPI lingers well above the Fed's 2% target. Together, these unofficial indicators suggest the Fed may soon need to relax policy by lowering borrowing costs to support the economy. The potential easing could bode well for assets like bitcoin, which is now down nearly 50% from its record high of over $126,000. The Fed this month left the benchmark borrowing rate unchanged in the 3.5%-3.75% range, while flagging concerns about inflation. Analysts' projections on what it will do next are all over the place. JPMorgan expects the Fed to keep rates unchanged throughout this year and then increase sometime in 2027, while other banks expect at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. An economist who correctly predicted Japan's fiscal issues expects Trump's nominee for Fed chairman, Kevin Warsh, to cut rates by 100 basis points before the mid-term elections in November.24:T430,Bitcoin's slide to around $60,000 has created significant challenges for companies holding Bitcoin treasuries, with combined unrealized losses approaching $10 billion across eight major entities. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has been hit hardest with $6.85 billion in unrealized losses on its 713,502 BTC holdings purchased at an average cost of $76,047. Other heavily impacted companies include Metaplanet ($1.45 billion underwater) and Twenty One Capital ($906.7 million loss). Only one company, Next, remains profitable with a $179.5 million unrealized gain on BTC purchased at lower prices.

The situation is complicated by market-to-NAV ratios affecting these companies' abilities to raise capital during the downturn. With Bitcoin already 51% below its October 2025 peak of $126,000, potential further declines could dramatically increase losses - Strategy alone could face an additional $20.29 billion loss if Bitcoin drops to $38,000. This comes as Bitcoin ETFs experience net outflows, removing a key buyer bloc that previously helped absorb supply pressure.25:Tb6d,การร่วงลงของราคา Bitcoin ไปที่ระดับประมาณ 60,000 ดอลลาร์สร้างความท้าทายอย่างมากให้กับบริษัทต่างๆ ที่ถือ Bitcoin ในคลังโดยรวม โดยขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นรวมกันเกือบ 10,000 ล้านดอลลาร์ใน 8 เอนทิตี้หลัก Strategy (เดิมชื่อ MicroStrategy) ได้รับผลกระทบหนักที่สุดด้วยขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 6,850 ล้านดอลลาร์จากการถือ Bitcoin 713,502 เหรียญที่ซื้อที่ราคาเฉลี่ย 76,047 ดอลลาร์ บริษัทอื่นๆ ที่ได้รับผลกระทบอย่างหนัก ได้แก่ Metaplanet (ขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 1,450 ล้านดอลลาร์) และ Twenty One Capital (ขาดทุน 906.7 ล้านดอลลาร์) มีเพียงบริษัทเดียวคือ Next ที่ยังคงกำไรด้วยกำไรที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 179.5 ล้านดอลลาร์จาก Bitcoin ที่ซื้อในราคาที่ต่ำกว่า

สถานการณ์นี้ซับซ้อนยิ่งขึ้นจากอัตราส่วนมูลค่าต่อสินทรัพย์สุทธิ (market-to-NAV) ที่ส่งผลต่อความสามารถในการระดมทุนของบริษัทเหล่านี้ระหว่างภาวะตลาดที่ตกต่ำ ด้วย Bitcoin ที่ลดลงไปแล้ว 51% จากราคาสูงสุด 126,000 ดอลลาร์ในเดือนตุลาคม 2025 การที่ราคาจะลดลงต่อไปอาจทำให้ขาดทุนเพิ่มขึ้นอย่างมหาศาล - Strategy อย่างเดียวอาจเผชิญกับขาดทุนเพิ่มเติม 20,290 ล้านดอลลาร์หากราคา Bitcoin ตกลงไปที่ 38,000 ดอลลาร์ สิ่งนี้เกิดขึ้นพร้อมกับที่ Bitcoin ETF มีมูลค่าสุทธิที่ไหลออก ซึ่งกำจัดกลุ่มผู้ซื้อที่สำคัญที่เคยช่วยดูดซับแรงกดดันด้านอุปสงค์26:T21bb,Bitcoin's (BTC) slide to as low as $60,233 overnight, before recovering somewhat to $65,443, has left most of the largest pure-play Bitcoin treasury companies deeply underwater on their holdings, with combined unrealized losses approaching $10 billion across eight entities that collectively control more than 850,000 BTC. The reckoning hits hardest at the top. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, holds 713,502 BTC at an average cost basis of $76,047 per coin, resulting in an unrealized loss of $6.85 billion at current prices. That's a 12.6% drawdown on a treasury worth $47.4 billion at spot, but the company's scale means every $1,000 move in Bitcoin's price swings its paper position by $713.5 million. Metaplanet, the Japanese hotel firm turned Bitcoin accumulator, sits $1.45 billion underwater on 35,102 BTC acquired at an average of $107,716. Its 38.3% unrealized loss reflects the timing risk associated with late-2024 and early-2025 purchases made near all-time highs. Twenty One Capital reports a $906.7 million paper loss on 43,514 BTC purchased at $87,280.37, leaving it 23.9% underwater. The value considered is derived from a July 29, 2025, filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The dataset, sourced from Bitcoin Treasuries, tracks only companies whose business model centers exclusively on Bitcoin accumulation. Coinbase , Tesla , and other firms with diversified operations don't qualify, making this a pure test of conviction versus cost basis. Seven of the eight names analyzed are currently underwater. The sole exception is Next, which purchased 5,833 BTC at $35,670.09 and still holds an unrealized gain of 86.3% ($179.5 million). Bar chart showing unrealized profit and loss positions for eight pure Bitcoin treasury companies at $66,443.75 BTC spot price, with Strategy leading losses at negative $6.85 billion. The mNAV compression risk Market-to-net-asset-value ratios add a reflexive dimension to the pain. Metaplanet trades at an mNAV of 1.018, essentially in line with its BTC holdings, while Strategy's 0.784 multiple implies the market values its equity at a 21.6% discount to its Bitcoin treasury. Nakamoto, with 5,398 BTC and a 0.329 mNAV, trades at a 67% discount despite holding coins acquired at $119,729, representing a 44.5% unrealized loss. This divergence matters because underwater treasuries often need either premium mNAV multiples or dilutive equity raises to keep accumulating. In drawdowns, markets typically demand the opposite: wider discounts and higher hurdle rates for new capital. Companies that remain profitable, such as Next, retain optionality. They can hold, realize gains to fund operations, or deploy proceeds defensively. Names 40% underwater face a different calculus: holding becomes a forced bet that Bitcoin rebounds before financing windows close . Scatter plot mapping market-to-NAV ratios against unrealized loss percentages for Bitcoin treasury companies, with bubble sizes representing BTC holdings and showing Nakamoto trading at steep discount despite being 44% underwater. The incremental damage The current $65,443 price is 51% below Bitcoin's October 2025 peak of $126,000 , part of a broader crypto market drawdown that has erased nearly $2 trillion in value. Earlier this week, $2.5 billion in Bitcoin liquidations accelerated the deleveraging, and Financial Times noted rising prediction-market odds of a sub-$60,000 outcome. Stifel's technical models flag $38,000 as a cycle-style crash target based on trendline support. If Bitcoin sees a sustained drop below $60,000, a 9% decline from current levels, Strategy's incremental loss deepens by $4.6 billion , Metaplanet's by $226 million, and Twenty One Capital's by $280 million. At $50,000, those figures balloon to $11.73 billion, $577 million, and $715 million, respectively. A slide to $38,000 would impose an additional $20.29 billion loss on Strategy alone, beyond the $6.85 billion it's already underwater. Strive, holding 13,132 BTC at a $105,850 basis, would see its $517.5 million current loss expand by $373.5 million if Bitcoin hits $38,000. ProCap's 5,000 BTC, purchased at $104,219.34, would deepen its $188.9 million underwater position by an additional $142 million. Even Next, still profitable at current prices, would surrender $165.9 million of its $179.5 million paper gain if Bitcoin falls to $38,000, leaving it barely above break-even.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which accumulated aggressively through 2024 and early 2025, have seen net outflows in recent weeks as institutional allocators rotate toward safer assets. That flow reversal removes a key buyer bloc that previously absorbed supply pressure, leaving treasury companies as the dominant diamond-hands cohort. But “diamond hands” is a narrative, not a financing strategy. Companies accumulating via convertible debt or equity raises face rising costs and shrinking mNAV premiums.

You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. Metaplanet's 1.018 multiple gives it equity-issuance capacity near parity with BTC holdings. Strategy's 0.784 means every dollar raised via equity costs 1.27 dollars of Bitcoin value on a look-through basis. Nakamoto's 0.329 multiple turns equity raises into a 3-to-1 dilution tax. Reflexivity trap The danger isn't only the mark-to-market loss but also the feedback loop. Underwater treasuries compress mNAV multiples, raising the cost of new capital, slowing accumulation, weighing on equity sentiment, and compressing multiples further. Companies with high cost bases bought into strength. If Bitcoin continues to fall, they bought into the top of a cycle. Twenty One Capital's $87,280.37 basis, disclosed in SEC filings, sits 24% above current prices but 13% below Strategy's $76,047 average. It becomes a matter of timing, not conviction. ProCap's estimated $104,219.34 basis and Strive's $105,850 cluster in the same late-2024 buying window. All three are now 36-37% underwater, meaning they would need Bitcoin to rally above $91,000 to break even, a 37% gain from current levels. What happens at $38,000 If Stifel's $38,000 target materializes, the aggregate loss for these eight treasuries would exceed $25 billion in incremental damage from today's levels. Strategy alone would result in a $20.29 billion hit on top of its current $6.85 billion paper loss, bringing total unrealized losses to $27.14 billion. Metaplanet would be nearly $2.5 billion underwater total, while Twenty One Capital would approach $2.2 billion. At that price, even Next would fall short of breakeven, erasing its $179.5 million cushion. The entire cohort would be underwater, with no optionality other than to hold and wait for a recovery that markets are increasingly pricing as uncertain. Pure Bitcoin treasuries bet that conviction plus scale equals compounding. When Bitcoin rises, leverage amplifies gains and mNAV multiples expand, turning equity into a call option on BTC with embedded financing arbitrage. When Bitcoin falls, the same leverage turns paper losses into financing constraints and multiple compressions into a reflexive trap. The current $65,443 price doesn't erase the thesis. Instead, it stress-tests it. Strategy's $6.85 billion unrealized loss represents 12.6% of its BTC value, a figure that would be tolerable if Bitcoin rebounds. If it doesn't, the question becomes: at what price does underwater become unsustainable, and who decides when conviction turns into capitulation? For now, the market has rendered its verdict through mNAV: premiums for profitable treasuries, discounts for underwater ones, and steep discounts for those without clear exit ramps. The paper loss leaderboard isn't static. It recalibrates with every $1,000 move in Bitcoin, and the next leg down will determine whether these treasuries are value traps or cycle survivors. Mentioned in this article Posted in27:T1824,Bitcoin rebounded 11%, but $540 million long leverage raises 25% downside risk toward $48,800. Long-term holder selling surged from 2,300 BTC to 246,000 BTC, up nearly 10,500%. Exchange supply fell from 1.23 million to 1.22 million BTC, signaling early buy-the-dip behavior. Bitcoin’s recent rebound has revived the buy-the-dip narrative, but the data tells a more complicated story. After falling nearly 15% and briefly touching the $60,000 zone, the Bitcoin price bounced more than 11%, drawing traders back into long positions. At first glance, the bounce looks encouraging. However, bearish chart patterns, rising leverage, and fragile spot demand suggest the market may not be out of danger yet. With a potential 25% downside still in play, the latest bounce is now facing serious scrutiny. Bear Flag, Rising Leverage, and Falling Exchange Supply Signal Risky Optimism Bitcoin’s short-term risk is already visible on the 4-hour chart. Sponsored Sponsored After the sharp sell-off toward $60,000, the Bitcoin price formed a rebound structure that now resembles a bear flag pattern. This setup typically appears when the price pauses after a strong drop before continuing lower. If the lower trendline breaks, the pattern points to a downside move of nearly 25%, targeting the $48,000–$49,000 zone. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . Bearish BTC Structure: TradingView Despite this technical warning, leverage is rising again. Following the 11.18% rebound, more than $540 million in new long positions were built on Binance alone. This shows that traders are once again using heavy leverage, betting that the bottom is already in. Similar behavior has p receded major liquidations in past downturns. Long Leverage Comes Back: Coinglass At the same time, spot market behavior reflects a growing buy-the-dip mindset. Bitcoin supply on exchanges fell from around 1.23 million BTC to 1.22 million BTC between February 5 and February 6. This decline suggests that traders are withdrawing coins, possibly for short-term holding, expecting higher prices. BTC Supply Dips: Santiment Public figures and social media sentiment have also turned more optimistic, reinforcing the ‘Buy-the-Dip’ narrative. Sponsored Sponsored Buying $2,000,000 of btc at 67,000. Bookmark this. — Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) February 5, 2026 Together, these signals possibly show misplaced confidence. A fragile chart pattern, rising leverage, and early dip buying are forming at the same time. When optimism builds before structural weakness is resolved, downside risk often increases rather than fades. Long-Term Holders Keep Selling as Realized Price Support Comes Into Focus While short-term traders are turning bullish, long-term holders, the most stable folks, are moving in the opposite direction. The Long-Term Holder Net Position Change, which tracks the 30-day supply shift among investors holding for more than one year, has remained deeply negative since early January. On January 6, this metric showed net selling of around 2,300 BTC. By February 5, that figure had worsened to roughly 246,000 BTC. Long-Term Holders Selling: Glassnode This represents a nearly 10,500% increase in long-term distribution in just one month. In simple terms, the most conviction-driven investors are still reducing exposure. Sponsored Sponsored This behavior becomes more concerning when combined with the long-term holder realized price. The realized price represents the average acquisition cost of coins held by long-term investors. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or falls below this level, it signals deep market stress. In past cycles, major rallies only began after the price stabilized around this zone; however, not immediately. Currently, the long-term holder realized price sits near $40,260. Key Support Level: Bitcoin Magazine As Bitcoin moves closer to this level, more long-term investors approach breakeven. If the price drops below it, many enter losses, often accelerating capitulation. This dynamic played out in late 2022 before the final bear market bottom formed. So far, that reset has not happened. Long-term holders are still selling, not accumulating. Their realized price is becoming a key downside magnet. This suggests the market has not completed its full deleveraging and redistribution phase. Sponsored Sponsored Key Bitcoin Price Levels Show Why $48,000 and $40,000 Matter Next All technical and on-chain signals now converge around a few critical price zones. On the downside, the first major support sits near $53,350. A failure here would expose the $48,800 region, which aligns with the bear flag target and prior consolidation zones. If $48,800 breaks, attention shifts to the long-term holder realized price near $40,260. This zone represents the deepest structural support in the current cycle. A move into this region would indicate broad capitulation among long-term investors and confirm a deeper bear phase. Bitcoin Price Analysis: TradingView In a worst-case scenario, extended weakness could even open the door toward $37,180, based on longer-term projections and historical support clusters. On the upside, Bitcoin must reclaim $69,510 on a sustained 4-hour closing basis to regain short-term credibility. A move above $73,320 would be required to invalidate the bearish pattern. Until that happens, rallies remain vulnerable. With leverage rebuilding, long-term holders still selling, and critical support levels approaching, the current rebound lacks structural confirmation. Under these conditions, buy-the-dip strategies remain exposed to sharp reversals rather than sustained upside.

The cryptocurrency has avoided severe sell-offs that impacted many assets, and its daily chart now displays a classic bullish reversal candlestick pattern. This pattern, characterized by a long downside wick and strong buying near local lows, typically signals that sellers are losing control as demand begins to absorb supply. Additionally, a false breakdown from a tightening wedge formation has created conditions for a potential rebound as short positions close and buyers enter at discounted prices. Compared to Bitcoin, SHIB has shown resilience during recent market turbulence, maintaining its structure within a wider range while BTC broke below significant support levels. If SHIB successfully breaks above short-term moving averages (current resistance levels), analysts suggest a potential 20-30% recovery could be possible, though it remains uncertain whether this early recovery attempt will develop into a sustained rally or succumb to renewed selling pressure.29:Tab3,Cover image via U.Today Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

After weeks of persistent downward pressure, Shiba Inu may be nearing a pivotal moment as recent price action starts to show early indications of a possible bullish reversal . Even though the entire cryptocurrency market is still brittle after Bitcoin's dramatic decline, SHIB has avoided the worst sell-off stages that impacted numerous important assets, creating space for a technical rebound scenario to emerge. Shiba Inu can reverse Following a protracted decline, SHIB has produced a traditional bullish reversal candlestick structure on the daily chart. With a long downside work and buyers stepping in forcefully close to local lows, the most recent candle demonstrates a strong rejection of lower prices. This pattern usually signals a short-term reversal or relief rally as sellers are losing control, as supply starts to be absorbed by demand. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView Additionally, the price action comes after a breakdown from a tightening wedge formation, where buying interest at lower levels swiftly overtook selling pressure that had initially increased. False breakdowns like these frequently serve as catalysts for rebounds when short positions are closed and buyers enter the market at a discount, trapping late sellers. HOT Stories It is not that bad Crucially, interest should also be paid to SHIB's performance in comparison to Bitcoin. During the recent market turbulence, Bitcoin broke below historically significant support zones, but SHIB did not collapse as catastrophically. In contrast, the token's structure remained consistent across its wider range, indicating that downside exhaustion might be nearer than many traders suspected.

Only time will tell if this early attempt at recovery develops into a more robust comeback or fades due to fresh selling pressure.2a:T9bc,ACCM, a contracts for differences (CFD) broker focused on emerging markets, has entered motor racing, but not through the usual Formula 1 deals. Instead, it has become a multi-year sponsor of the Prima Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team.
Is MotoGP Going to Be the Next F1 for CFD Brokers?
Although a handful of other retail brokers have marketed their brands around top two-wheeler racing, it has yet to become mainstream like Formula 1. This also suggests that brokers can secure MotoGP sponsorship deals at a much lower cost than Formula 1 ones.
Although none of the Formula One teams or the brokers have officially revealed the financial terms of their deals, Libertex’s Chief Marketing Officer, Marios Chailis, said that the lowest-tier F1 sponsorship deal costs about $5 million.

“Partnering with Prima Pramac Yamaha allows us to connect our brand with a sport that reflects how modern trading works: fast-moving, data-driven, and powered by innovation,” said Tien Ching, CEO of ACCM, in a statement. This also highlights how the target customers of CFD brokers often align with motor racing fans.
Getting Exposure Is the Goal
ACCM operates under regulatory licences in Australia and South Africa, along with offshore licences in Seychelles and Vanuatu. According to SimilarWeb data, most of the brokerage’s website traffic comes from Vietnam and Thailand.
The latest sponsorship deal has made the broker the MotoGP team’s “Official Partner”, allowing it to place its branding across team assets and digital platforms. The broker will also gain access to a “range of other significant rights”.
The Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team also has a large social media following, with 560,000 followers on Instagram and another 560,000 on Facebook, meaning any promotion of the broker would reach a wide audience worldwide.
In addition, sponsor brands can gain visibility on MotoGP’s wider channels if placed well. These channels have more than 17.9 million followers on Instagram and over 7 million subscribers on YouTube.
While football and Formula 1 remain the top sports marketing choices for CFD brokers, many are now turning to niche local sports to better target their key markets. The number of broker deals with individuals and teams in mixed martial arts, cricket, rugby, and other niche sports continues to grow.


This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.2b:T214c,The trading industry has become increasingly focused on what is visible to the end user. AI-powered assistants, automated insights, and increasingly sophisticated interfaces now dominate product launches and marketing narratives. Innovation is often judged by the features traders touch, rather than by the systems that determine what actually happens when an order hits the market.
This creates a blind spot. In calm conditions, many platforms look capable. Prices move smoothly, orders are filled without friction, and spreads behave as expected. But calm markets can disguise meaningful differences in how trading platforms are built, supported, and engineered for scale.
When markets stop behaving calmly, those differences stop being theoretical. Surprise data releases, geopolitical developments, and sudden shifts in liquidity place very different demands on technology. Trading engines can look identical on the surface, but their behavior under stress depends on what sits behind them: capacity, execution locations, redundancy, and failover design. In those moments, innovation is experienced less through features and more through pricing coherence and execution quality. 
This is why the industry focus is gradually shifting. The question is no longer which platform looks most advanced. It is which systems remain most predictable when markets accelerate.
Technology that disappears into the experience
In many fields, the most effective technology is often the least visible. When something works perfectly, it fades into the background. The user doesn’t notice the engineering; they notice the absence of friction. In trading, we follow a similar logic.
Some traders may experiment with AI-generated insights or predictive tools. But what matters most in real trading conditions is simpler: execution that behaves consistently, prices that make sense, and systems that remain stable when markets become chaotic. 
This is where technology delivers its greatest value: beneath the surface, in how systems are designed, monitored, and refined over time. At Exness, improvements to pricing behavior, liquidity handling, and execution stability are initiated and shaped by people, engineers, product specialists, and analysts, who understand how markets behave under stress.
Data analytics and automation help teams stress-test behaviour, detect anomalies earlier, and refine execution logic over time. But accountability remains human-led. Someone designs it, someone monitors it, and someone owns the outcome.
Calm markets can hide a weak trading engine
Quiet markets allow fragile systems to operate without drawing attention to their limitations. Under these conditions, many platforms appear competent.
Take a trader entering a silver trade right after a high-impact event. With one broker, spreads widen to reduce broker risk, execution slows as liquidity deteriorates, and the order is filled meaningfully away from the intended level. With another, spreads stay tight, execution remains fast, and sufficient volume is available at the displayed prices to support clean fills. The trade idea may be identical, but the outcome diverges as the platforms behave differently under stress. 
This is what volatility reveals. Spreads may widen unexpectedly, execution can become inconsistent, liquidity may thin, and prices can gap. Orders that are usually executed predictably may deviate from expectations through slippage or delayed execution. 
Traders may interpret these outcomes as failure of discipline or strategy. In practice, the cause can be structural. When a trading platform degrades under pressure, even well-considered decisions can produce distorted results. 
Why trust is the real competitive layer
As trading technology grows more capable, trust becomes both more fragile and complex. Faster systems and increased automation can improve efficiency, but they can also make outcomes harder to interpret.
Many of these improvements are rarely visible. Execution safeguards and stability mechanisms are often understated. Their impact is felt indirectly: fewer disruptions, more predictable costs, and outcomes that better align with intent.
In this environment, trust is formed through experience rather than promises. Traders observe how execution behaves during volatility, how trading costs evolve under stress, and whether platform behaviour remains consistent when conditions change. Over time, predictability becomes a practical advantage.
Performance under stress is not only a technical question but also a commercial one. In volatile moments, brokers and liquidity providers face a choice: maintain competitive conditions and take on more risk, or degrade conditions defensively and reduce it. Traders experience this through spread behaviour and execution quality. The drivers sit deeper: risk posture, liquidity access, and the platform’s ability to handle stress.
Some market participants, like Exness, place more emphasis on how their systems behave under pressure than on surface-level features with limited impact on traders’ experience. This reflects a wider industry discussion: features matter less when they do not translate into better execution, more reliable pricing, or lower friction.
The most valuable uses, including AI, are those that reduce a user’s cognitive and production load. In other words, they strengthen understanding, not substitute judgment. Technology is at its most effective when it simplifies the complex and reinforces autonomy, rather than overriding it. Ultimately, the value of any tool must be measured by its outcome: does it lead to more reliable pricing, lower friction, and a more resilient decision-making process?.
The structural foundations of execution under stress
Designing systems for volatile conditions requires a different architectural focus. 
One priority is the integration of pricing and execution. When quoting and order routing operate as one coherent mechanism, prices are more likely to reflect tradable conditions and execution is more likely to align with what traders expect at entry.
Another is liquidity at scale. Depth becomes most visible when volatility increases and order sizes grow. A platform that can absorb larger trades without amplifying market impact helps preserve pricing integrity under stress.
A third consideration is resilience and monitoring. Reliability is built into the architecture: geographically distributed execution locations to reduce latency, redundant routes to avoid single points of failure, and automated failover so the platform can keep operating even if one component degrades. But architecture alone is not enough. Continuous monitoring is what makes reliability operational, tracking server loads, latency, rejection rates, slippage, and price behaviour so stress is detected early and capacity can be rebalanced before it shows up for traders as wider spreads, delayed fills, or inconsistent pricing.
Finally, there is a structural divide between platforms that are largely outsourced and those engineered in-house. Many brokers rely on ready-made third-party systems: fast to implement, easy to integrate, sufficient in normal conditions. But the trade-off is flexibility to improve. Performance depends on how the external solution handles routing, liquidity access, and volatility.
Brokers with scale often invest in in-house technology to retain control over those key components. It allows them to fine-tune behaviour under volatility and maintain consistent performance when conditions stop being predictable.
Build for the moments that matter
Many visible AI features are designed for stable conditions, where execution quality is treated as given. In calm environments, speed and convenience are a given. But when volatility rises, assumptions break: spreads degrade, liquidity thins, and execution becomes the differentiator.
At that point, real innovation is less about what the interface claims to do and more about whether the platform maintains coherent pricing and predictable fills when the market accelerates.
As the industry integrates increasingly powerful tools, the question becomes less about whether AI is present and more about how it is applied. A trading platform designed with stress in mind does not eliminate uncertainty, but it can change how that uncertainty is experienced. Over time, that distinction will shape how traders evaluate platforms, and how trust is earned.

The memecoin's price trajectory is closely following Bitcoin (BTC), which has fallen to the $62,000 mark, with some analysts predicting BTC could drop further to $38,000.\n\nThe market-wide downturn is attributed to tighter Federal Reserve policies, a shrinking liquidity crisis, macroeconomic worries, and geopolitical tensions.

Without Bitcoin's recovery, SHIB will likely face additional selling pressure, making it unclear whether the asset has reached its bottom or will crash further.","aiSummaryThai":"ตลาดคริปโตกำลังเผชิญกับความตื่นตระหนกอย่างหนัก โดย Shiba Inu (SHIB) ร่วงลงถึงระดับ $0.000005 ซึ่งเป็นระดับที่ไม่เคยเห็นมาตั้งแต่เดือนกรกฎาคม 2021 SHIB ได้สูญเสียมูลค่าไปอย่างมีนัยสำคัญ ลดลง 9.2% ใน 24 ชั่วโมงที่ผ่านมา, 17.7% ในช่วงสัปดาห์ที่แล้ว, เกือบ 26% ในช่วง 14 วัน และ 34.7% ในเดือนที่ผ่านมา ราคาของเหรียญนี้เคลื่อนไหวตาม Bitcoin (BTC) ซึ่งร่วงลงมาถึงระดับ $62,000 โดยนักวิเคราะห์บางคนคาดการณ์ว่า BTC อาจจะร่วงลงไปถึง $38,000\n\nการร่วงลงของตลาดอย่างกว้างขวางเกิดจากนโยบายที่เข้มงวดขึ้นของ Federal Reserve, วิกฤตสภาพคล่องที่ลดลง, ความกังวลทางเศรษฐกิจมหภาค และความตึงเครียดทางภูมิรัฐศาสตร์ แม้ว่าตลาดจะมีการฟื้นตัวเล็กน้อย แต่ก็ยังไม่แน่ชัดว่านี่คือสัญญาณของจุดต่ำสุดหรือไม่ เนื่องจาก SHIB เป็นเหรียญ Meme จึงมีความเสี่ยงสูงกว่าและอาจใช้เวลาในการฟื้นตัวนานกว่าคริปโตสกุลอื่นๆ หาก Bitcoin ไม่ฟื้นตัว SHIB น่าจะเผชิญกับแรงขายเพิ่มเติม ทำให้ไม่ชัดเจนว่าสินทรัพย์นี้ได้ถึงจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือยังคงร่วงลงต่อไป","author":"Paigambar Mohan Raj","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Panic has gripped the crypto market as Bitcoin (BTC) fell to the $62,000 mark earlier today, Feb. 6,…","createdAt":"2026-02-06T10:45:34.904Z","enclosure":"https://watcher.guru/news/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-12.35.57-PM-1024x663.png","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T10:45:34.904Z","fullContent":"$11","keyPoints":["Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced significant losses, dropping to $0.000005 with declines of 9.2% in 24 hours and 34.7% over the past month.","SHIB is following Bitcoin's price trajectory and may not recover until BTC shows positive movement, with some analysts predicting BTC could fall to $38,000.","Market-wide downturn attributed to tighter Fed policies, liquidity crisis, and geopolitical tensions, with uncertainty whether SHIB has reached its bottom or will fall further."],"link":"https://watcher.guru/news/is-shiba-inu-at-its-bottom-or-will-shibs-price-crash-further","pubDate":"2026-02-06T10:33:00.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"bearish","source":"WatcherGuru","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"Is Shiba Inu At Its Bottom, Or Will SHIB’s Price Crash Further?","translatedContent":"ความตื่นตระหนกได้ครอบงำตลาดคริปโตเมื่อ Bitcoin (BTC) ลดลงสู่ระดับ $62,000 ในช่วงต้นวันนี้ 6 กุมภาพันธ์...","translatedTitle":"Shiba Inu ถึงจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือไม่? หรือราคา SHIB จะร่วงหนักลงไปอีก?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:00:42.805Z","wordCount":339},{"_id":"6985c31538f2116917ca084a","guid":"https://news.bitcoin.com/?p=790149&preview=true&preview_id=790149","__v":0,"aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","author":"Bitcoin.com","categories":["general"],"category":"general","content":"Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, announced a significant strategic realignment, including workforce reductions and geographic market exits.
