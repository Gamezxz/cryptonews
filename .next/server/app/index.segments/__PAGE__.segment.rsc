4:T689,Several Ethereum whales are at risk of major liquidations as ETH trades near $1,900. Trend Research leads with 356,000 ETH ($671 million) vulnerable between $1,562 and $1,698, followed by Joseph Lubin with 293,000 ETH ($553 million) and the “7 Siblings” group with 287,000 ETH ($541 million) exposed near $1,029 to $1,075. Trend Research recently sold 170,000 ETH ($322 million) and repaid $344 million in loans, reducing exposure. If ETH prices drop further, forced liquidations could trigger sell-offs, though adding collateral may help whales avoid wipeouts.

Feb 6, 2026, 11:14 a.m. IREN (IREN) earnings showed weaker than expected headline results, with the company missing consensus on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as it accelerates its transition from bitcoin mining to AI Cloud. Financially, Q2 revenue declined to $184.7 million, missing expectations and down from $240.3 million in Q1, while the company reported a net loss of $155.4 million, also below consensus. STORY CONTINUES BELOW IREN secured $3.6 billion of GPU financing for its Microsoft contract which together with a $1.9 billion customer prepayment is expected to cover around 95% of GPU related capex. Tech giant Amazon (AMZ) also missed expectations on EPS but beat on revenue , according to investing.com. Investor focus shifted to management’s plan to spend around $200 billion on capex in 2026, primarily AI related. Amazon shares are down 10%. Pre-market update Bitcoin rebounded from around $60,000 to $66,000, driving a broad rally across crypto exposed equities. Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, rose 7% in pre-market trading, mirroring a 7% gain for Galaxy (GLXY) and MARA Holdings (MARA) while Coinbase (COIN) increased by 6%.6:T673,Cardano founder and former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson revealed in a livestream called Red Days that his crypto holdings have lost over 3 billion dollars as Bitcoin fell below 66,000 and ADA dropped to 0.25, down 92 percent from its 2021 peak. Hoskinson stressed his commitment to blockchain technology over profit, saying money is not his motivation, and he would stay dedicated even after such losses. He highlighted his clean record compared to scandals like FTX and urged the community to keep building despite market volatility.

The bold strategy was seen as risky at one point, as the leading cryptocurrency is known for its extreme volatility. While using money from your own account is one thing, taking personal loans takes it to a whole different level. Bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted, as a crash can erase all profits in a jiffy. I n a recent Reddit post, the user highlighted that he purchased BTC using personal loans at an average price of $35,000 over four years. In total, the trader accumulated 4.75 BTC using this innovative method. However, he continued to repay the loans with funds from his day job.

Source: Shutterstock / In Green, modified by Blockworks At the time of the Reddit post, Bitcoin was trading at $76,000 level on Thursday and began attracting attracting bearish sentiments. Moreover, the trader’s wallet had ballooned to $356,000 early February 2026. That’s an unrealized profit of approximately 113% in just four years. This makes the risk worth it as his investment has more than doubled in value. The investor also revealed that he’ll be throwing in more money each month if Bitcoin dips below $70,000. He called it the perfect buying opportunity again, despite still paying off his personal loans to acquire BTC. The risk-to-reward ratio is extremely high in this scenario, but it has paid off handsomely. BTC experienced a major crash on Friday falling to the $65,000 level. The trader also revealed that he plans to take another $50,000 in personal loans if Bitcoin falls further in value. “In the meantime, I’m throwing everything I can at it each month while we’re in the $70-80k range with earned income from my job. I’ve been stacking this whole time while paying down the loans,” he wrote. Note: The post was made on Reddit, and Watcher Guru could not independently verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin holder.8:T415,U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated remarkable resilience despite Bitcoin's price decline of over 50% since October 2025. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the BTC held by these ETFs has only decreased by approximately 7%, from 1.362 million to 1.272 million BTC. Global BTC ETF holdings showed similar strength, dropping by just 4.8% from 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC over the same period, indicating that investors, primarily 'boomers', are holding firm despite market volatility.

Bitcoin recently fell to $60K for the first time since October 2024, though it slightly recovered to $65K at press time. While BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced a record trading volume of $10 billion alongside a 13% price drop, analysts are divided about whether the market has reached its bottom. Chris Burniske expects further downside to levels around $58K or $50K, while Bitfinex analysts suggest that without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any upward movement might only represent a lower high in a fragile market.9:Taef,กองทุน Bitcoin ETF ในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้แสดงความยืดหยุ่นอย่างน่าทึ่งแม้ในช่วงที่ราคา Bitcoin ลดลงกว่า 50% ตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2025 ตามที่ Eric Balchunas นักวิเคราะห์ ETF จาก Bloomberg ระบุ ปริมาณ Bitcoin ที่ถือโดยกองทุนเหล่านี้ลดลงเพียงประมาณ 7% เท่านั้น จาก 1.362 ล้านเหรียญเป็น 1.272 ล้านเหรียญ การถือครอง Bitcoin ETF ทั่วโลกก็แสดงความแข็งแกร่งในทำนองเดียวกัน โดยลดลงเพียง 4.8% จาก 1.50 ล้านเป็น 1.428 ล้านเหรียญ ซึ่งชี้ให้เห็นว่านักลงทุน ส่วนใหญ่เป็น "ผู้สูงอายุ" ยังคงถือหุ้นอย่างมั่นคงแม้ในช่วงที่ตลาดผันผวน

Bitcoin เพิ่งลดลงสู่ระดับ $60K เป็นครั้งแรกนับตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2024 แม้ว่าจะฟื้นตัวกลับมาเล็กน้อยสู่ระดับ $65K ในขณะที่เขียนข่าว แม้ว่ากองทุน Bitcoin ETF ของ BlackRock จะมีมูลค่าการซื้อขายสูงสุดในรอบวันที่ $10 พันล้าน พร้อมกับการลดราคา 13% นักวิเคราะห์ยังคงแบ่งความเห็นเกี่ยวกับว่าตลาดได้ผ่านจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือไม่ Chris Burniske คาดการณ์ว่าจะมีการปรับตัวลดลงต่อไปยังระดับประมาณ $58K หรือ $50K ในขณะที่นักวิเคราะห์จาก Bitfinex ชี้ให้เห็นว่าหากไม่มีความต้องการในการซื้อขายและกระแสเงินทุนจากกองทุน ETF ที่แข็งแกร่งขึ้น การเคลื่อนไหวขาขึ้นใดๆ อาจเป็นเพียงจุดสูงสุดที่ต่ำกว่าในตลาดที่อ่อนแอa:Tb48,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively resilient despite the crypto asset’s +50% price decline. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the overall BTC held by the ETFs dropped by only about 7%. He viewed the holders, mainly boomers, as ‘diamond hands.’ “Bitcoin’s price is down 44% from October high, but the amount of BTC held by the ETFs is only down 6.6%. Boomer strong.” Source: X Before the October crash, the U.S spot BTC ETFs held a record high of 1.362 million BTC. This stash had since dropped to 1.272 million BTC by the 4th of February. Can ETFs withstand the pressure? When zoomed out to the global holdings of BTC ETFs (covering offerings in the U.S, E.U., Asia, and others), the same picture emerged. Over the same period, global BTC ETF holdings dropped by only 72,400 BTC from October’s high of 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC. That’s only a 4.8% drop in BTC holdings. Source: BOLD report Put differently, the market fears and outflows in the past few weeks have not led to a massive drop in BTC held by ETFs. However, the asset extended its price decline over the past 24 hours, tagging $60K for the first time since October 2024. Although BTC price had moved up slightly to $65K at press time, there was still uncertainty about whether it had reached its final market bottom. Source: Bloomberg That said, the latest dump saw BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) post its record daily trading volume of $10 billion and its second-worst price drop 13%. For Balchunas , this was ‘brutal,’ further raising questions about the ETF buyers’ ability to remain resilient if markets go lower. Is $60K the market bottom? Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a VC partner at Placeholder and former Ark Invest crypto lead, said the sub-$60K levels were of ‘interest’ but expected an extra downside. “Watching with interest, but not buying yet. Expect a bounce, but doubt the bloodletting is done.” Chris nailed the October market top and the ensuing drawdown. He had projected that the market could bottom near $58K or $50K (levels that aligned with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and on-chain cost basis. For their part, Bitfinex analysts appeared hopeful that the market was not in a better position to form a bottom after the price dropped below the previous cycle peak of $69K. But they also echoed Burniske’s caution, “Order books show most demand under $66k as support bids were hit or pulled. That can set up a relief bounce, but without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any move risks being just a lower high in a fragile market.” Source: Bitfinex Final Thoughts BTC held by U.S spot ETFs has dropped by only 7% despite BTC’s +50% price decline since October 2025 Despite the extended dip to $60K-$65K zone, analysts appeared cautiously optimistic for a potential BTC bottom.b:Td75,HBAR trades within four month pattern as bullish divergence builds quietly. Breakout above $0.1042 risks triggering $6 million short liquidations. Loss of $0.0786 support would invalidate bullish breakout overwhelmingly. Hedera has remained under selling pressure after a steady decline brought HBAR back to retest a long-standing technical pattern. The token has been trading within this structure for several months, limiting upside attempts. While multiple indicators now point toward a bullish setup, price action has yet to confirm the shift, keeping sentiment cautious. HBAR Has An Underlying Bullish Trigger HBAR’s Money Flow Index is showing early signs of strength despite continued price weakness. On the two-day chart, the indicator is forming a bullish divergence with the price. While HBAR has printed a lower low, the MFI has held higher lows, indicating rising buying pressure beneath the surface. Sponsored Sponsored This divergence suggests that selling momentum is gradually fading. As sellers lose control, buyers begin to step in without immediately pushing prices higher. Such conditions often precede trend reversals, especially when supported by compression patterns and improving momentum indicators across higher timeframes. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . HBAR MFI. Source: TradingView Derivatives data highlights growing risk for bearish traders. The liquidation map shows that a breakout in HBAR price would place significant pressure on short positions. If the price reaches $0.1013, approximately $6.2 million in short liquidations could be triggered, forcing rapid position closures. Given the pattern HBAR is currently trading within, a breakout could occur quickly once resistance is breached. Forced liquidations typically accelerate price movement, amplifying upside momentum. As a result, short traders face heightened exposure if HBAR breaks above its current range. HBAR Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass HBAR Price Breakout Is Possible HBAR price is trading near $0.0826 at the time of writing, holding above the $0.0786 support level. The altcoin has been moving within a descending channel for nearly four months. This structure reflects prolonged consolidation while volatility continues to compress. A breakout from this pattern appears increasingly likely as selling pressure dissipates on a macro scale. Confirmation would require HBAR to breach the channel’s upper trendline and flip $0.1042 into support. Such a move would trigger short liquidations and push the price toward $0.129, the pattern’s projected 32% upside target. HBAR Price Analysis. Source: TradingView However, downside risk remains if broader market conditions fail to improve. A loss of the $0.0786 support would weaken the structure. Under that scenario, HBAR could slide toward $0.0622. A move to that level would invalidate the bullish thesis entirely.

Executives previously confirmed plans to Decrypt for a POLY token and a possible airdrop focused on “true utility.” The move comes as Polymarket faces fresh legal challenges, with traders seeing low odds of a token launch before May. Polymarket has filed trademark applications for " POLY " and " $POLY " with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, signaling concrete steps toward launching its long-anticipated native token , even as the prediction market faces mounting regulatory challenges. The filings, submitted Thursday by Polymarket's parent company Blockratize Inc., cover trademark protection for “cryptocurrency services, financial trading platforms, and blockchain-based payment systems.” Both applications describe services for "providing a digital currency or digital token for use by members of an on-line community via a global computer network" and list cryptocurrency trading, financial exchange services, and portfolio management among their intended uses. Polymarket’s token plans The trademark applications offer the first formal public paper trail tied to Polymarket’s token plans. Polymarket CMO Matthew Modabber confirmed plans for a POLY token and airdrop in October, telling Degenz Live, a show from Decrypt's sister company, Rug Radio, that the company wants the token to have "true utility" and "longevity." CEO Shayne Coplan teased the token in October by tweeting a "POLY" ticker alongside Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and BNB . Sources familiar with the matter previously told Decrypt that Polymarket does not plan to launch its token until it has regained a foothold in the U.S. market. The company moved closer to that goal in November, when it received CFTC approval to operate domestically, nearly four years after paying a $1.4 million fine and exiting the U.S. market. On prediction market Myriad , owned by Decrypt ’s parent company Dastan, users place just a 30% chance on Polymarket announcing its token before May. Prediction markets face challenges The trademark filings come at a critical juncture for Polymarket as it treads through U.S. market reentry while facing state-level legal challenges that threaten its core business model. But the path forward has grown more complicated as, most recently, the Nevada state court issued a temporary restraining order blocking Polymarket from offering event-based contracts in the state, finding its activities likely violate Nevada gaming law. The platform subsequently removed the case to federal court, claiming the state action conflicts with federal law, according to Daniel Wallach, founder and principal of Wallach Legal LLC, a law firm specializing in sports wagering and gaming law. The trademark applications await examination by the USPTO. Polymarket did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Founder of the HEX platform Richard Heart has taken to Twitter to comment on the current crypto bloodbath in the market and say that he does not believe Bitcoin to be the best cryptocurrency out there. Among the projects that Heart reckons to surpass BTC, the crypto entrepreneur named Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum. "Ethereum is better than Bitcoin" Heart published an S-curve (also known as the S-shaped curve or sigmoid curve) which visualizes how new tech, innovations, products, etc., spread around the community and become adopted by the population or within the market over time. HOT Stories I've been telling you Bitcoin was at the top of its S curve for several years now. Which means that, if you want to make mad gains, you might want to buy something better, with more potential. PulseChain is better. Ethereum is better. PLSX, HEX, and ProveX, when it comes out… pic.twitter.com/QCZedimVUZ — Richard Heart (@RichardHeartWin) February 6, 2026 Heart claims (not for the first time, according to his tweet) that Bitcoin has been at the top of its S-curve for several years already. This means that BTC is already at its mature stage, according to Heart – it has a vast support, and all users who will ever need it already have it, the growth in new users is slowing down drastically. Basically, Heart is certain that Bitcoin has nowhere much to grow in terms of new users and adoption. He claimed that gains can hardly be made with Bitcoin; other coins are much better suited for that. One of those, according to Heart, is Ethereum, since it has more technical potential. The entrepreneur added that the real quality and utility of a cryptocurrency does not make it a popular market asset. It is rather true about its price: “Price is a function of marketing and whether people decide to press green or red buttons.” You Might Also Like Bitcoin recovers to $66,000 Over the past day, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has managed to put up a recovery of 5.26%, returning to the $66,000 level. However, this recovery was preceded by a mammoth 30.55% collapse over the past week. On Wednesday, January 28, Bitcoin lost the $90,000 price line and began to decline rapidly, eventually landing at the $63,000 level per coin. This price collapse coincided with the 30% crash of gold and silver on January 30 after these precious metals reached new all-time highs above $5,000 and $100, respectively. Two other major reasons of the Bitcoin crash, according to analysts, have been the poor reports of the Magnificent 7 (which triggered investor fears around the AI bubble) and the fact of Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh, known for his hawkish stance on monetary policy, for the position of the new Fed chairman.11:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

Bitcoin price dropped nearly 8.6%, hovering near the $65,000 level, while Ethereum and major altcoins followed with sharp intraday losses. The intensity of the move points to more than routine profit-taking. With liquidations accelerating and sentiment collapsing into extreme fear, the ongoing crypto crash creates a dilemma among investors, one that forces traders and investors to confront a familiar question: Is this a buy-the-dip moment, or is patience still required? Liquidations Data Reveals Market Still Under Stress The key trigger of today’s crypto crash lies in derivatives data. More than $2.59 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most aggressive leverage flushes of the year. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the bulk of forced closures, while altcoins experienced cascading liquidations as price levels failed in quick succession. At the same time, total open interest fell 10.1% to $95.77 billion, confirming that leverage is being removed, not repositioned. Such conditions typically reflect instability rather than balance. Markets tend to struggle to form durable bottoms while liquidation velocity remains elevated. Sentiment Hits Extreme Fear, But Capitulation Is Incomplete The Crypto market Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, placing sentiment deep into Extreme Fear, a zone that historically precedes medium-term recoveries. However, structural signals remain mixed. Bitcoin exchange balances increased by 13,800 BTC, suggesting that selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself. Coins are still moving toward exchanges rather than being locked away by long-term holders. In previous market cycles, sustainable bottoms emerged after extreme fear persisted alongside declining exchange inflows, a condition that has not yet fully materialized. Bitcoin Price at $65K: A Decision Zone, Not a Confirmed Bottom Bitcoin’s drop toward the $65,000 region is now colliding with a signal that long-term market participants rarely ignore. The monthly stochastic oscillator has slipped into extreme oversold territory, a condition that has appeared only three times over the past decade. Each prior occurrence aligned with major bear market bottoms and the start of prolonged accumulation phases. However, history also shows this signal is not a timing trigger. In previous cycles, Bitcoin did not immediately reverse higher. Instead, price often spent weeks sometimes months moving sideways or making marginal new lows as leverage flushed out and sentiment reset. That dynamic matters today. While the long-term stochastic suggests downside may be structurally limited, short-term data still reflects stress. Open interest is falling, liquidations remain elevated, and exchange balances are rising, indicating that traders are still de-risking rather than rebuilding positions. In practical terms, this creates a split narrative. For long-horizon investors, conditions are beginning to resemble early accumulation zones. For short-term traders, volatility risk remains high until liquidation pressure eases and price stabilizes above key support. The signal argues that Bitcoin may be closer to a bottom than a top, but confirmation will require patience, not prediction. Final Thoughts: Right Time to Buy or Wait? The broader crypto market is showing classic stress signals, not clear bottoming behavior. Extreme fear readings, multi-billion-dollar liquidations, and declining open interest suggest forced deleveraging is still working its way through the system. While some assets are showing relative strength and selective accumulation, this looks more like rotation and positioning not a broad-based recovery. Historically, durable market bottoms form after volatility compresses and sellers exhaust, not during peak liquidation phases. Right now, liquidity is thin and confidence remains fragile, leaving room for further downside or prolonged consolidation. This is not a clear “buy the dip” moment for the overall market. Caution and patience are still the better strategy, with selective accumulation only where strong fundamentals and on-chain support clearly justify it.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) also suffers the same fate, dipping to the $0.000005 price level. According to CoinGecko data, SHIB’s price is down 9.2% in the last 24 hours , 17.7% in the last week, nearly 26% in the 14-day charts, and 34.7% over the previous month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are distraught, wondering if the asset’s price is at its bottom, or will it crash further. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Is Shiba Inu’s Price At Its Bottom, Or Is More Bad News On The Way? Source: WatcherGuru Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at levels last seen in July 2021. Investors are sitting on heavy losses, especially those who bought the asset at the top. SHIB’s price is currently following Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory, and may not rebound until the original crypto registers some positive price action. Some analysts anticipate BTC to fall further. Stifel anticipates BTC’s price to dip to the $38,000 level. BTC falling to $38,000 could pull Shiba Inu (SHIB) further down. However, the market seems to be making a slight rebound today. Although the rebound may see a rejection, it could also signal a bottom. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently hangs on a thread. The market-wide crash comes amid tighter Federal Reserve policies and a shrinking liquidity crisis. Macroeconomic worries and geopolitical tensions have added further fuel to the fire. Additionally, market participants took a risk-off approach with their investments. Shiba Inu (SHIB) being a memecoin carries some of the highest risks in the market. Memecoins will likely take much longer to recover than other cryptocurrencies. Also Read: New Shiba Inu Price Prediction Says SHIB May Hit $0.0004: Here’s When Given the uncertain environment and the bearishness that looms over the market, it is unclear if Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at its bottom, or if the asset’s price sill fall further. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) does not recover from its depths, SHIB will likely face additional sell pressure.14:Tcf1,Millions and millions of PI tokens will be released in the following weeks, which could bring even more pain for the bulls. The past several weeks have not been kind to the cryptocurrency markets. This trend only intensified on Thursday when the entire market bled out, with multiple double-digit price crashers. Naturally, Pi Network’s PI token was not spared, and it dumped to fresh all-time lows of under $0.135 (on CoinGecko). This meant that the asset has plunged by over 30% in the last month alone. On a broader scale, PI is down by more than 95% since its all-time high marked on February 26, 2025. Despite this massive correction, some members of the ever-vocal and optimistic Pi Network community tried to find the silver linings. This one, for example, outlined the skyrocketing PI transaction volume, which, he believes, shows “increased interest in PI despite the manipulation games done by whales.” This one was even more bullish, predicting a mind-blowing surge to $4 from the current dip in the first six months after the second Mainnet migration and once old Pioneers (Pi Network users and investors) are done selling off. More Pain to Come? If we are being realistic, it’s hard to even imagine such a rally happening soon. Not only because the overall crypto market seems to be dominated by the bears, but also due to PI’s recent price performance and the unlocking schedule for new tokens. Data from PiScan shows that almost 8 million coins will be freed in the next month on average. What’s even more worrying is the fact that this number will skyrocket to over 18 million on February 12 and to 23.6 million on February 13. Such a massive number of tokens to be unlocked might result in more immediate selling pressure from investors who have been waiting a long time for their holdings to become available for trading. This is particularly true in such a time of panic. You may also like: Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Before the FOMC Meeting, Pi Network (PI) Soars by 15%: Market Watch Pi Token Unlock Schedule. Source: PiScan The Good News On the positive side, the chart above demonstrates that the number of unlocked tokens will decline after February 20 and will normalize, which could ease the selling pressure. Additionally, there are rumors circulating online that one of the largest and oldest exchanges, Kraken, might be planning to list Pi Network’s native token, which could boost its liquidity and legitimacy among investors. 🚨 BREAKING: Kraken Exchange is preparing to integrate the Pi blockchain and list $PI for trading 👀 If confirmed, this could be a major step for Pi ecosystem adoption. ⁰Eyes on what comes next. #PiNetwork #PI #Kraken #CryptoNews #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/BAWZLcGQnH — SMC KAPIL DEV (@smckapildev) February 6, 2026 SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer).

Feb 6, 2026, 10:21 a.m. Quantum computing is moving from theory to long term strategic consideration, and Strategy (MSTR) has made it clear it intends to be proactive rather than reactive during the company's Q4 earnings call on Thursday. Strategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, plans to initiate a bitcoin security program to coordinate with the global cyber, crypto, and bitcoin security community. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The company addressed growing discussion around quantum risk and reaffirmed its commitment to bitcoin security, framing quantum not as an immediate threat but as a future engineering challenge the network can prepare for. Strategy reported a net loss of $12.4 billion for the quarter. Shares fell 17% on the day, trading as low as $104, but market focus quickly shifted to executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commentary. Saylor revisited a long list of historical Bitcoin FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that the network has already overcome quantum concerns, while acknowledging that quantum deserves serious long term planning. The company outlined a range of key points on quantum computing, predicting that quantum technology is likely more than a decade away and pointing out that the Bitcoin community is already researching quantum-resistant cryptography. Shares are up 6% in pre-market trading as bitcoin has rebounded to $65,000.

On Friday, Vyper said core parts of its product will begin shutting down on Feb. 10, while limited functions will remain accessible. Users were directed to Pump.fun’s Terminal (formerly Padre) to continue using the tools. The move reflects a broader strategy by Pump.fun to consolidate more of the trading workflow, from token launches to execution and analytics, as memecoin activity cools from the speculative frenzy of late 2024 and early 2025. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Pump.fun did not respond to Cointelegraph before publication. Expansion beyond token launches Pump.fun’s acquisition of Vyper follows earlier moves into trading infrastructure. On Oct. 24, Pump.fun acquired trading terminal Padre to strengthen liquidity and improve execution for tokens launched on its platform. Padre was later rebranded and now operates as Terminal. In January, Pump.fun also launched an investment arm called Pump Fund, marking what the company described as a pivot away from a pure memecoin focus. On Jan. 20, Pump Fund debuted alongside a $3 million hackathon aimed at backing early-stage projects, including those not directly related to crypto. Related: MEV trading returns to court in Pump.fun class-action lawsuit Consolidation amid a cooling memecoin market The expansion comes as memecoin activity fell from their peaks, when celebrities and several government leaders launched their own tokens . Pump.fun’s growth was driven by intense speculative activity on Solana, but revenue has since fallen as the popularity of memecoins weakened. Data from DefiLlama shows that Pump.fun’s monthly revenue peaked at more than $137 million in January 2025.

The -88% XRP collapse scenario first raised by U.Today on Jan. 20 is no longer theoretical. After losing the crucial $1.88 Bollinger Band midline, XRP crashed 41% to a low of $1.121. The monthly chart structure has now entered confirmed breakdown territory, with historical parallels pointing toward $0.33 or even $0.20 as valid targets. Unless bulls reclaim the $1.60 zone with volume, each failed monthly close reinforces the magnet effect toward the lower band. What was once dismissed as an absurd scenario is now unfolding step by step on the chart — with the next phase dependent on whether XRP will go for $1 . XRP/USD by TradingView No more than 17 days ago, on Jan. 20, a shocking U.Today forecast warned that XRP could collapse to $0.20 if the $1.88 Bollinger Band midline were to fail. Two weeks later and $5 billion of liquidations after, that scenario is no longer hypothetical. HOT Stories XRP has already lost over 41% since that alert, plunging to $1.121 in the last 24 hours before bouncing weakly. Worse — February’s candle opened and dropped directly below it without even a wick retest. In technical terms, this is a close confirmation of what many chartists dread: a full-band collapse setup. Is it time to worry about XRP price? The last time XRP closed the month below the Bollinger midline after a multimonth rally was in 2018. What followed was a two-year price suppression. The current downside magnet? The lower band, sitting near $0.336. If February closes below $1.60 and fails to reclaim the midband with volume, the main expectation is a gradual bleed into the $1 zone. Out there, a breakdown below $0.99 will open the corridor toward the full -88% target for XRP, represented visually by the Bollinger Bands . You Might Also Like Those placing breakout bets since the November 2024 liftoff must now reevaluate. Every monthly candle closing below $1.918 strengthens the validity of the $0.20 magnet. As of now, the -88% collapse is not absurd, and the next checkpoints are clear too: a $1.60 retest or $1 breakdown. Either way, XRP has lost its bullish protection level .19:Te28,Bitcoin ( BTC ) liquidated billions of dollars going into Friday as BTC price action set bearish records.

According to the earnings call held on the 5 February, the firm reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion in Q4 2025. Due to new reporting guidance, the entire loss was primarily an unrealized loss on its BTC holdings as the crypto rout intensified in late 2025 following October’s crash. Part of the report read, “Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2025 includes an unrealized loss on the Company’s digital assets of $17.4 billion. This is the fourth quarterly reporting period in which we have applied fair value accounting.” When adjusted for other incomes and expenses, the net loss for Q4 came down to $12.4 billion. Bitcoin bet weighs on Strategy The pioneer of corporate BTC treasury accumulated 713,502 coins at a cost of over $54 billion with an average price of $76k per BTC. Although this isn’t the firm’s bear market, the bet has recorded massive paper losses as BTC plunged below $65k on the charts. At press time, Strategy’s stash was worth $46.2 billion – Nearly 15% down after an $8 billion wipeout. Source: Saylor Tracker The mNAV, or relative valuation metric, between crypto holdings and the enterprise, fell further to 0.77x too, underscoring the broader bearish market sentiment. That’s not all either as its common stock, MSTR, has also not been spared from the market carnage. MSTR extends losses to 80% On Thursday, MSTR posted a 17% price decline after the earnings call and BTC’s sharp drop to $60k. This brought its losses, since the 2025 high of $453, to 76%. When zoomed from the November 2025 peak of $543, the overall losses totalled 80%. Source: MSTR vs BTC price, TradingView U.S pension funds have emerged as the hardest hit by MSTR’s meltdown. In fact, r eports indicated that 11 US pension funds may be staring down a paper loss of $330 million from holding the stock. These funds bought about 1.8 million MSTR shares at a cost of $577 million. However, they have now shrunk to $240 million as the stock dropped lower. At press time, MSTR was back to its 2024 price range of $100-$180. However, it remains to be seen whether the support will hold against bears. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff, a long-time BTC and Saylor critic, slammed the firm as a “fraud” and a “ponzi scheme.” He questioned Strategy’s capital-raising model for its BTC buys. In the past too, Schiff has taken advantage of BTC market routs to intensify attacks against the firm and Saylor. Final Thoughts Strategy reported a $17.4 billion loss in Q4, mainly due to a decline in BTC’s price which affected its unrealized PnL (profit and loss). Deepening market rout extended MSTR losses to 80% after dropping to the 2024 price range of $100-$180.1b:Tffc,In brief Crypto leaders rebuked Democrats after the party’s official X account posted “yikes” with a crypto crash graphic, calling it insensitive to investor losses across party lines. The backlash came as over $2.6B in positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with Bitcoin down 8% to $64,752. Executives and policy advocates warned that partisan mockery of market pain could hurt Democrats with crypto voters, as digital asset legislation advances before midterms. Crypto industry leaders fired back at Democrats on Friday after the party's official X account posted "yikes" alongside a graphic mocking crypto market losses, drawing accusations of partisan insensitivity as Bitcoin plunged and investors lost billions. The Democratic Party's tweet featured a chart showing Bitcoin's slide alongside an image of President Donald Trump wearing a MAGA hat, triggering immediate backlash from executives, lawyers, and government advisors who said the message dismissed widespread financial pain affecting investors across party lines. The controversial social media activity came as Bitcoin dropped 8.1% over the past 24 hours to $65,729, down 33.1% from a year earlier, according to CoinGecko data . "The sad thing about this tweet is that you're gloating in a lot of Democrats' painful financial losses right now," Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long replied to the post. "You do know that many Democrats own crypto too, right?" The crypto market saw some $2.6 billion in liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $2.13 billion coming from long positions, according to Coinglass data . Bitcoin led liquidations with $1.35 billion, including $1.1 billion from long positions, while Ethereum saw $443 million in long positions liquidated. A partisan issue? The dispute shows rising partisan tension around crypto policy, with industry voices cautioning that mocking market pain could alienate pro-crypto voters. "Probably not the message you want to be sending to the crypto community before midterms,” Patrick Witt, Executive Director of the President's Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, responded to the Democrats’ tweet. Meanwhile, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss quoted the post , saying, "It was always political persecution." Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton, who is currently running for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, connected the losses to broader economic mismanagement by both parties. "If career politicians from both parties didn't cause a $38T debt by running $2T annual deficits for decades, recklessly creating money out of thin air, devaluing our currency to the point inflation has priced regular people out of the economy—maybe they wouldn't turn to crypto to build wealth," he wrote. Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci called the Democrat post a "stupid tweet," saying “the best thing Trump has going for him is the incompetence of Democrats on this topic." Democrats vs Trump The Democrats’ post followed a tweet from California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office, which said, "Trump is crashing the crypto markets faster than he'd crash an Epstein party," further inflaming partisan tensions around crypto. In December, Newsom launched a website tracking what he called Trump's "criminal cronies," spotlighting pardoned crypto figures including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht . On Wednesday, Representative Ro Khanna launched an investigation into a $500 million UAE investment in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's crypto company, questioning whether the deal influenced U.S. policy on AI chip exports. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has repeatedly warned about Trump's conflicts of interest in crypto, noting the family has amassed over $1.2 billion in financial gains from digital assets since his second term began, while also opposing proposals to allow crypto in 401(k) retirement plans.

As prices dropped nearly 10% to around $64,000, Bitcoin hit its lowest level since late 2024. This sharp move pushed many investors to sell their holdings at a loss. Record Losses in a Single Day February 5 stood out as a major stress point for the market. On-chain analyst Murphy reported that realized losses reached about $3.2 billion in just one day—the highest daily total ever recorded. Realized losses reflect how much money investors actually lose when they sell below their buying price, making this a strong sign of panic selling. Murphy noted that this single-day loss was even larger than what was seen during major past crises, including the Terra-Luna collapse and the FTX bankruptcy . This highlights how severe and sudden the latest sell-off has been. Low Liquidity Made the Drop Worse The Kobeissi Letter added that the decline was not driven by fear alone. It also exposed weak market liquidity. Bitcoin’s market depth, the amount of money available to absorb large trades, is still more than 30% lower than its October high. With fewer buyers at key price levels, even moderate selling can cause sharp price drops. The last time market depth was this low was after the FTX collapse in 2022, showing that the market remains fragile during periods of heavy selling. No Clear Trigger Behind the Sell-Off Unlike previous crashes caused by major news events, this downturn did not have one obvious trigger. Murphy said that aside from a data adjustment issue in late 2025, the current loss numbers reflect real selling pressure. He also defended using dollar-based loss data, saying it better shows the financial and emotional stress investors feel during sharp declines. Extreme Price Volatility The Kobeissi Letter also pointed out another first: Bitcoin recorded a single-day drop of more than $10,000. Even during earlier high-liquidation events, prices did not fall this much in one day. This has led to speculation that a large leveraged trader was forced to exit, which likely accelerated the fall and exposed how risky large positions can be. How Much Lower Can Bitcoin Go? Crypto researcher Sherlock highlighted a long-term pattern in Bitcoin’s history. Each bear market has resulted in smaller losses than the previous one, as the asset has matured. Bitcoin fell about 93% in 2011 and around 77% in 2022. If this trend continues, the current cycle could see a drop of roughly 70% from the $126,000 peak, pointing to a possible bottom near $38,000. This outlook suggests that while the recent sell-off has been painful, it may not be the final low and a quick recovery should not be taken for granted. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin is down due to low market liquidity and forced selling from leveraged positions. With fewer buyers, sell orders moved prices sharply lower. How big were the losses in the recent Bitcoin sell-off? On February 5, investors realized losses of roughly $3.2 billion in a single day—the highest daily loss ever recorded, exceeding losses seen during the Terra-Luna and FTX collapses. Could Bitcoin’s price drop further from here? Based on historical bear market patterns, Bitcoin could potentially fall around 70% from its $126,000 peak, suggesting a possible bottom near $38,000, though market conditions remain fluid. Was there a specific event that caused Bitcoin’s latest sell-off? No single news event triggered it. The drop appears driven by market structure, leverage unwinding, and fragile liquidity conditions.

The latest ETH fall is a result of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, selling 16,384 ETH, causing a temporary market mayhem. Buterin reportedly is selling ETH to solidify future plans for Ethereum, including robusting its stack software and hardware. “If you’re wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH. He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware. This includes areas like privacy-preserving technologies (e.g., ZK proofs, FHE, differential privacy), secure hardware, encrypted messaging apps, local-first software, operating systems, biotech (personal and public health), finance, communication, and governance tools.” If you're wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH: He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware.

Vitalik Flouts New Roadmap as Price Drops1e:Tc34,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 The cryptocurrency market extended its decline, with total capitalization falling to $2.2 trillion. Altcoins, particularly Solana [SOL], suffered steep losses. Solana dropped 15%, breaking below $70 and hitting a two‑year low of $67 before rebounding slightly to $81.6. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $80.78, down 10.44% on the daily charts. At the same time, its market capitalization fell below $50 billion, indicating substantial capital outflows. Solana whale fully liquidated amid market dip Amid this downside volatility, whale investors in the futures market, especially those taking long positions, experienced forced liquidations. According to Onchain Lens, a whale got completely liquidated on its SOL long position, losing $6.7 million. Overall, the whale lost over $16 million during the current market decline. Significantly, this whale is not an isolated case. In fact, over $167 million in long positions were liquidated between February 5 and 6. Source: CoinGlass Usually, forced selling exerts immediate selling pressure on the market, further accelerating the asset’s downward momentum. Thus, these liquidations exacerbated market stress, causing Solana to decline further, particularly given the current market weakness. However, in response to this liquidation threat, investors have changed strategy and increased short positions. According to CoinGlass data, the Long Short ratio fell below 1 to 0.96 at press time. Source: CoinGlass A ratio below 1 indicates that most traders across all exchanges have taken short positions, anticipating further losses. However, Binance and OKX remain among the top traders, with the Long-Short ratio averaging 3.0. Is SOL’s bottom in yet? Solana declined further as forced selling in futures markets created additional selling pressure on an already weakened market structure. At the same time, the altcoin jumped back above $80, as investors took the slip below $70 as an opportunity to buy the dip on the spot. Source: CoinGlass As such, the altcoin’s Netflow dropped to November 2025 levels, falling to -$101 million on the 5th of February. Notably, over $7 billion worth of SOL flowed out of exchanges, a clear sign of aggressive spot accumulation. Despite this, the purchases have remained insufficient to offset market conditions, and sellers have retained complete control. In fact, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell deeper into the oversold zone, dropping to 21 as of writing. Source: TradingView With momentum indicators dropping to such a level, this suggested strong downward momentum, with buyers entirely displaced. Equally, it indicated a potential continuation of the prevailing trend. Therefore, if these conditions persist, SOL could drop again below $70. For a trend reversal, buyers must keep up and reclaim the altcoin’s Parabolic SAR at $103. Final Thoughts Solana crashed to a 2-year low of $65 before rebounding to a high of $81. Solana whale was fully liquidated on its Sol long positions, resulting in $6.7 million in losses and raising total losses to $16 million.1f:T416,Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported a staggering $12.6 billion quarterly loss, primarily due to unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings as the cryptocurrency's price fell below the company's average acquisition cost. The sharp Bitcoin decline from approximately $73,100 to $62,400 during the quarter erased what were recently more than $30 billion in paper profits, highlighting the deep connection between the company's financial performance and crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business.

As the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 713,000 BTC, Strategy's stock has plummeted over 70% in the past year. Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor maintains a "HODL" strategy, while other companies like BitMine face similar unrealized losses on their Ethereum holdings. Analysts remind that Bitcoin's volatility is characteristic of its history, and long-term investors continue to focus on scarcity and long-term growth potential despite short-term price fluctuations.20:Tac0,บริษัท Strategy (เดิมชื่อ MicroStrategy) รายงานขาดทุนไตรมาสที่น่าตกใจมูลค่า 12.6 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่มาจากขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นจริงในสินทรัพย์ Bitcoin เนื่องจากราคาสกุลเงินดิจิทัลลดลงต่ำกว่าราคาซื้อเฉลี่ยของบริษัท การร่วงลงของ Bitcoin จากระดับประมาณ 73,100 ดอลลาร์เป็น 62,400 ดอลลาร์ในไตรมาสนี้ ทำให้กำไรบนกระดาษที่เคยมีมากกว่า 30 พันล้านดอลลาร์เมื่อเร็วๆ นี้หายไป ซึ่งสะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความสัมพันธ์ที่ลึกซึ้งระหว่างผลการดำเนินงานทางการเงินของบริษัทกับการเคลื่อนไหวของตลาดคริปโตมากกว่าธุรกิจซอฟต์แวร์พื้นฐาน

ในฐานะผู้ถือครอง Bitcoin รายใหญ่ที่สุดในโลกด้วยจำนวนกว่า 713,000 BTC หุ้นของ Strategy ได้ร่วงลงมากกว่า 70% ในช่วงปีที่ผ่านมา แม้จะขาดทุนเป็นประวัติการณ์ ประธานกรรมการบริหาร ไมเคิล เซลเลอร์ ยังคงยึดมั่นในกลยุทธ์ "HODL" ในขณะที่บริษัทอื่นๆ เช่น BitMine ก็เผชิญกับขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นจริงในสินทรัพย์ Ethereum เช่นกัน นักวิเคราะห์เตือนว่าความผันผวนของ Bitcoin เป็นลักษณะประจำในประวัติศาสตร์ของมัน และนักลงทุนระยะยาวยังคงมุ่งเน้นที่ความหายากและศักยภาพการเติบโตในระยะยาว แม้จะเผชิญกับความผันผวนของราคาในระยะสั้น21:T1505,Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has reported a staggering fourth-quarter net loss of roughly $12.6 billion, ranking among the largest quarterly losses ever recorded by a U.S. public company. The hit was driven almost entirely by unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings, underscoring how deeply the firm’s balance sheet is tied to crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business. Crypto Market Crash Erases Billions in Paper Gains The loss followed one of Bitcoin’s sharpest drawdowns in recent history . During the quarter, Bitcoin plunged nearly 15% intraday, sliding from around $73,100 to a low of $62,400. This move pushed Bitcoin below Strategy’s average acquisition price of roughly $76,000, flipping the firm’s position from massive unrealized gains into deep losses. Just a few months earlier, Strategy was sitting on more than $30 billion in paper profits when Bitcoin surged to record highs. Strategy Stock Feels the Pressure The market reaction was swift. Strategy shares dropped sharply after the earnings release and continued falling in after-hours trading. Over the past year, the stock has been down more than 70%, erasing much of the premium investors once assigned to the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since its November 2024 peak, the stock is now down nearly 80%, highlighting how quickly sentiment has turned. Bitcoin Exposure Magnifies Financial Impact Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, with more than 713,000 BTC on its balance sheet as of early February. Much of this position was accumulated during the late-2024 bull run, when Bitcoin briefly climbed above $120,000. With prices now well below those levels, unrealized losses have ballooned, making quarterly results highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s volatility. Saylor Stays Defiant as Critics Circle Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor showed no sign of wavering, posting a brief “HODL” message on X. However, critics have grown louder. Investors like Michael Burry have warned that sustained declines in Bitcoin could trigger cascading losses for corporate holders, reviving long-standing concerns around leverage and exposure to non-yielding assets. Ethereum Slide Hits BitMine Too Strategy is not alone. BitMine Immersion Technologies is facing roughly $8.2 billion in unrealized losses after Ethereum slipped to around $1,930, well below its average purchase price of $3,826. The company holds about 4.29 million ETH but has cushioned the blow by staking over 2.9 million ETH, generating around $188 million in annual yield, while maintaining strong cash reserves and no debt. Volatility, Not Failure Amid the turmoil, Anthony Pompliano offered a broader perspective, arguing that Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a flaw. He pointed out that repeated 50–85% drawdowns have defined Bitcoin’s history, yet the network has continued to operate flawlessly for over a decade. While critics celebrate downturns, long-term holders remain focused on scarcity, betting that short-term pain is temporary in Bitcoin’s long-term growth story. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own, and why does it matter? MicroStrategy holds over 713,000 Bitcoin, making it the world’s largest corporate holder. This massive stake makes its financial results extremely sensitive to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Did MicroStrategy sell its Bitcoin after the loss? No. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor signaled a continued “HODL” strategy, indicating the company does not plan to sell its Bitcoin despite the paper losses. Are other companies facing similar crypto losses? Yes. For example, BitMine faces about $8.2 billion in unrealized losses on its Ethereum holdings, though it offsets some risk through staking rewards and strong cash reserves. Is Bitcoin’s volatility a sign it’s failing? No. Analysts note Bitcoin’s history is defined by large drawdowns, yet the network operates flawlessly. Long-term investors view volatility as a temporary feature of its long-term growth story.

The move was backed by over $2 billion in long liquidations , wiping out more than $380 billion from the total crypto market capitalization. In contrast, the Decred (DCR) price has shown strong relative strength. The token surged over 30%, reaching levels above $24.65in the past few hours, even as market sentiment remained weak. The rally appears driven by a clean technical breakout, placing DCR among the top-performing assets over the past seven days. Price has moved above the key resistance zone between $22.17 and $23.40, a range that previously capped upside attempts. A daily close above this zone would likely validate bullish continuation toward the next target near $30. The key question now is whether DCR can maintain momentum and continue decoupling from the broader bearish market structure. Following the breakout, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, pointing to rising volatility as buying activity picks up. At the same time, On-Balance Volume (OBV) has moved sharply higher, indicating that more volume is flowing in on up-moves than on declines—often a sign of accumulation rather than short-term speculation. With demand building alongside improving volume structure, DCR appears positioned for a potential move toward the $30 level. However, for this bullish setup to remain valid, the price needs to secure a daily close above the immediate resistance zone between $22.12 and $23.51. Failure to do so could delay further upside and keep the Decred (DCR) price vulnerable to short-term pullbacks.

Crypto analyst Nathan Sloan of Investing Made Simple laid out the key levels to watch and why the 4-year cycle suggests this crash may follow a familiar pattern. After failing to reclaim $100,000, which flipped from support to resistance, Bitcoin flushed down past $70,000 and is currently trading around $65,845 . But this sell-off isn’t limited to crypto. Gold is correcting sharply, silver dropped 10% in a single day, and the NASDAQ is pulling back as well. Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Points to a Familiar Pattern Sloan highlighted that averaging the 2017 and 2021 cycle tops closely predicted the exact market top this cycle. That makes the 4-year cycle harder to dismiss as a coincidence. Bitcoin has now posted five consecutive red months since October. That has only happened once before, during the 2018 bear market, which saw six in a row. A relief rally is statistically overdue since Bitcoin has never posted more than six consecutive negative months. Historically, cycle bottoms have landed around October. Bitcoin Buying Levels to Watch Sloan outlined four price zones he considers important. The $70,000 level, the previous all-time high from the 2021 cycle, has already been broken. Bitcoin is now trading well below what Sloan considers a strong long-term entry zone. The $63,000 level, now less than 4% below current prices, would mark a 50% drawdown from the all-time high. At that level, simply returning to the prior high would mean a 2x return. The 200-week moving average sits just below $60,000 and is rising. Sloan flagged this as a historically reliable level. Every major crypto crash has either touched or broken below this line before recovering. “If you can get in between 60 and 70, if you can ignore all the pain and the fear over the next 3 to 6 months, you’ll likely do very, very well,” he said. Fed Policy Could Decide What Happens Next Sloan sees monetary policy as the strongest macro correlator for crypto. He compared the current setup to 2019, the last time the Fed pivoted, which saw a roughly 53% drawdown before recovery. Also Read: Trump’s New Fed Chair Kevin Warsh Could Cut Rates “Aggressively”, Says Analyst His personal plan is to buy back in around the $63,000 level within the next month or two, accepting the risk of being early. “The only downside for me is that I might be too early. So yes, Bitcoin could go sideways for months. It could even come down a little bit more,” he said.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction 2026 is becoming increasingly bullish as the 2025’s second half comes to a close soon, with all-time highs of $125K reached this year as the highest point. As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop. The year was marked by optimism, driven by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, skyrocketing institutional adoption, clearer regulations, and unwavering political support. There were several macro downturns, too, that capped BTC’s uptrend, like trade tariffs and wars. Despite that, BTC holds its level, making it now seen as “a hedge against inflation” more than ever. Major players, including MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and several other entities, are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. The market enthusiasm is at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction 2026 – 2030 dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. Coinpedia’s BTC Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, Bitcoin faced constant resistance, leading to a decline. By early February, it fell below the 200-day EMA, and now approaching $65K. If it drops below that, it may reach $53K in Q1 2026. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $60,074.20 and $71,584.86 today. Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $65,545.2449 -8.06% Market Cap $ 1,309,927,617,728.46 24h Volume $ 145,126,686,163.65 Circulating Supply 19,985,090.00 Total Supply 19,985,090.00 All-Time High $ 126,198.0696 on 06 October 2025 All-Time Low $ 0.0486 on 14 July 2010 On February 5, 2026, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply below $70,000, marking its lowest point in 15 months. This decline is due to a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets, large-scale liquidations of leveraged positions, and reduced institutional demand. The market reacted to the potential appointment of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair, leading to expectations of tighter monetary policy and a larger U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which increased above 97.5, lessening the attractiveness of riskier assets like Bitcoin. This situation triggered forced liquidations and a decline in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 11, signaling “Extreme Fear” among investors. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin cannot hold the $65,000 support level, it may drop further, potentially reaching targets of $60,000 or lower. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, the Bitcoin price retested the lower border of the ascending wedge pattern as resistance, with a slight bullish attempt that proved to be a fakeout, leading to a deeper decline. This is exactly witnessed in January when the fall worsened to $80738 January end,and early February even penetrated the 200-day EMA band and is approaching $65Ksupport area. Itis expected that if BTC/USD doesn’t take support and keeps falling, then odds suggest that beneath $65K, the Q1 2026 could see price falling towards $53K. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2026 $60,000-$95,000 $100,000 – $108,000 $115,000 – $118,000 Bitcoin Price On-chain Outlook The on-chain data has showed strong accumulation in 2025 and sustained declines in exchange reserves. Crucially, this confirms the elevated institutional commitment, which is evident even in the US Spot ETFs data figures and the corporate adoption also reinforces this trend, with public company holdings nearly doubling since the start of the year. Ultimately, a Bitcoin price prediction 2025 suggests that the future potential depends strictly on how sustained buying demand remains, as well as geopolitical stability and regulatory clarity. If the current bullish sentiment persists, the BTC price is expected to reach a cycle high target of $150,000. Conversely, should global uncertainty intensify and sentiment turn negative, the downside risk is projected to find strong support around the $70,000 mark.

Feb 6, 2026, 9:52 a.m. The U.S. jobs market is cooling fast, a timely blow that could force the Federal Reserve to loosen its purse strings and potentially put a floor under the price of bitcoin BTC $65,835.49 . Planned layoffs, the job cuts that companies have announced but not yet executed, surged by 205% to 108,435 in January, according to data tracked by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That's the highest reading since January 2009, months after Lehman Brothers collapsed and pushed the global economy into recession. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Year-on-year, the announced cuts rose 118%, indicating a sharp weakening in the labor market in the first year of Donald Trump's second stint as president. The technology industry announced 22,291 reductions, with Amazon (AMZN) accounting for most, while United Parcel Service (UPS) announced 31,243 planned cuts. Andy Challenger, workplace expert at Challenger, Grey & Christmas, called it a high figure for January, in any case a seasonally weak month for hiring. "It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026," Challenger said. This data clashes with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly payrolls report, which still paints a resilient labor market picture. Private reports are increasingly becoming early warning flags, signaling cracks forming before the official figures. Earlier this month, the blockchain-based Truflation showed a precipitous drop in real-time inflation, to under 1%, even as the official CPI lingers well above the Fed's 2% target. Together, these unofficial indicators suggest the Fed may soon need to relax policy by lowering borrowing costs to support the economy. The potential easing could bode well for assets like bitcoin, which is now down nearly 50% from its record high of over $126,000. The Fed this month left the benchmark borrowing rate unchanged in the 3.5%-3.75% range, while flagging concerns about inflation. Analysts' projections on what it will do next are all over the place. JPMorgan expects the Fed to keep rates unchanged throughout this year and then increase sometime in 2027, while other banks expect at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. An economist who correctly predicted Japan's fiscal issues expects Trump's nominee for Fed chairman, Kevin Warsh, to cut rates by 100 basis points before the mid-term elections in November.26:T430,Bitcoin's slide to around $60,000 has created significant challenges for companies holding Bitcoin treasuries, with combined unrealized losses approaching $10 billion across eight major entities. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has been hit hardest with $6.85 billion in unrealized losses on its 713,502 BTC holdings purchased at an average cost of $76,047. Other heavily impacted companies include Metaplanet ($1.45 billion underwater) and Twenty One Capital ($906.7 million loss). Only one company, Next, remains profitable with a $179.5 million unrealized gain on BTC purchased at lower prices.

The situation is complicated by market-to-NAV ratios affecting these companies' abilities to raise capital during the downturn. With Bitcoin already 51% below its October 2025 peak of $126,000, potential further declines could dramatically increase losses - Strategy alone could face an additional $20.29 billion loss if Bitcoin drops to $38,000. This comes as Bitcoin ETFs experience net outflows, removing a key buyer bloc that previously helped absorb supply pressure.27:Tb6d,การร่วงลงของราคา Bitcoin ไปที่ระดับประมาณ 60,000 ดอลลาร์สร้างความท้าทายอย่างมากให้กับบริษัทต่างๆ ที่ถือ Bitcoin ในคลังโดยรวม โดยขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นรวมกันเกือบ 10,000 ล้านดอลลาร์ใน 8 เอนทิตี้หลัก Strategy (เดิมชื่อ MicroStrategy) ได้รับผลกระทบหนักที่สุดด้วยขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 6,850 ล้านดอลลาร์จากการถือ Bitcoin 713,502 เหรียญที่ซื้อที่ราคาเฉลี่ย 76,047 ดอลลาร์ บริษัทอื่นๆ ที่ได้รับผลกระทบอย่างหนัก ได้แก่ Metaplanet (ขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 1,450 ล้านดอลลาร์) และ Twenty One Capital (ขาดทุน 906.7 ล้านดอลลาร์) มีเพียงบริษัทเดียวคือ Next ที่ยังคงกำไรด้วยกำไรที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 179.5 ล้านดอลลาร์จาก Bitcoin ที่ซื้อในราคาที่ต่ำกว่า

The reckoning hits hardest at the top. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, holds 713,502 BTC at an average cost basis of $76,047 per coin, resulting in an unrealized loss of $6.85 billion at current prices. That's a 12.6% drawdown on a treasury worth $47.4 billion at spot, but the company's scale means every $1,000 move in Bitcoin's price swings its paper position by $713.5 million. Metaplanet, the Japanese hotel firm turned Bitcoin accumulator, sits $1.45 billion underwater on 35,102 BTC acquired at an average of $107,716. Its 38.3% unrealized loss reflects the timing risk associated with late-2024 and early-2025 purchases made near all-time highs. Twenty One Capital reports a $906.7 million paper loss on 43,514 BTC purchased at $87,280.37, leaving it 23.9% underwater. The value considered is derived from a July 29, 2025, filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The dataset, sourced from Bitcoin Treasuries, tracks only companies whose business model centers exclusively on Bitcoin accumulation. Coinbase , Tesla , and other firms with diversified operations don't qualify, making this a pure test of conviction versus cost basis. Seven of the eight names analyzed are currently underwater. The sole exception is Next, which purchased 5,833 BTC at $35,670.09 and still holds an unrealized gain of 86.3% ($179.5 million). Bar chart showing unrealized profit and loss positions for eight pure Bitcoin treasury companies at $66,443.75 BTC spot price, with Strategy leading losses at negative $6.85 billion. The mNAV compression risk Market-to-net-asset-value ratios add a reflexive dimension to the pain. Metaplanet trades at an mNAV of 1.018, essentially in line with its BTC holdings, while Strategy's 0.784 multiple implies the market values its equity at a 21.6% discount to its Bitcoin treasury. Nakamoto, with 5,398 BTC and a 0.329 mNAV, trades at a 67% discount despite holding coins acquired at $119,729, representing a 44.5% unrealized loss. This divergence matters because underwater treasuries often need either premium mNAV multiples or dilutive equity raises to keep accumulating. In drawdowns, markets typically demand the opposite: wider discounts and higher hurdle rates for new capital. Companies that remain profitable, such as Next, retain optionality. They can hold, realize gains to fund operations, or deploy proceeds defensively. Names 40% underwater face a different calculus: holding becomes a forced bet that Bitcoin rebounds before financing windows close . Scatter plot mapping market-to-NAV ratios against unrealized loss percentages for Bitcoin treasury companies, with bubble sizes representing BTC holdings and showing Nakamoto trading at steep discount despite being 44% underwater. The incremental damage The current $65,443 price is 51% below Bitcoin's October 2025 peak of $126,000 , part of a broader crypto market drawdown that has erased nearly $2 trillion in value. Earlier this week, $2.5 billion in Bitcoin liquidations accelerated the deleveraging, and Financial Times noted rising prediction-market odds of a sub-$60,000 outcome. Stifel's technical models flag $38,000 as a cycle-style crash target based on trendline support. If Bitcoin sees a sustained drop below $60,000, a 9% decline from current levels, Strategy's incremental loss deepens by $4.6 billion , Metaplanet's by $226 million, and Twenty One Capital's by $280 million. At $50,000, those figures balloon to $11.73 billion, $577 million, and $715 million, respectively. A slide to $38,000 would impose an additional $20.29 billion loss on Strategy alone, beyond the $6.85 billion it's already underwater. Strive, holding 13,132 BTC at a $105,850 basis, would see its $517.5 million current loss expand by $373.5 million if Bitcoin hits $38,000. ProCap's 5,000 BTC, purchased at $104,219.34, would deepen its $188.9 million underwater position by an additional $142 million. Even Next, still profitable at current prices, would surrender $165.9 million of its $179.5 million paper gain if Bitcoin falls to $38,000, leaving it barely above break-even.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which accumulated aggressively through 2024 and early 2025, have seen net outflows in recent weeks as institutional allocators rotate toward safer assets. That flow reversal removes a key buyer bloc that previously absorbed supply pressure, leaving treasury companies as the dominant diamond-hands cohort. But “diamond hands” is a narrative, not a financing strategy. Companies accumulating via convertible debt or equity raises face rising costs and shrinking mNAV premiums.

You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. Metaplanet's 1.018 multiple gives it equity-issuance capacity near parity with BTC holdings. Strategy's 0.784 means every dollar raised via equity costs 1.27 dollars of Bitcoin value on a look-through basis. Nakamoto's 0.329 multiple turns equity raises into a 3-to-1 dilution tax. Reflexivity trap The danger isn't only the mark-to-market loss but also the feedback loop. Underwater treasuries compress mNAV multiples, raising the cost of new capital, slowing accumulation, weighing on equity sentiment, and compressing multiples further. Companies with high cost bases bought into strength. If Bitcoin continues to fall, they bought into the top of a cycle. Twenty One Capital's $87,280.37 basis, disclosed in SEC filings, sits 24% above current prices but 13% below Strategy's $76,047 average. It becomes a matter of timing, not conviction. ProCap's estimated $104,219.34 basis and Strive's $105,850 cluster in the same late-2024 buying window. All three are now 36-37% underwater, meaning they would need Bitcoin to rally above $91,000 to break even, a 37% gain from current levels. What happens at $38,000 If Stifel's $38,000 target materializes, the aggregate loss for these eight treasuries would exceed $25 billion in incremental damage from today's levels. Strategy alone would result in a $20.29 billion hit on top of its current $6.85 billion paper loss, bringing total unrealized losses to $27.14 billion. Metaplanet would be nearly $2.5 billion underwater total, while Twenty One Capital would approach $2.2 billion. At that price, even Next would fall short of breakeven, erasing its $179.5 million cushion. The entire cohort would be underwater, with no optionality other than to hold and wait for a recovery that markets are increasingly pricing as uncertain. Pure Bitcoin treasuries bet that conviction plus scale equals compounding. When Bitcoin rises, leverage amplifies gains and mNAV multiples expand, turning equity into a call option on BTC with embedded financing arbitrage. When Bitcoin falls, the same leverage turns paper losses into financing constraints and multiple compressions into a reflexive trap. The current $65,443 price doesn't erase the thesis. Instead, it stress-tests it. Strategy's $6.85 billion unrealized loss represents 12.6% of its BTC value, a figure that would be tolerable if Bitcoin rebounds. If it doesn't, the question becomes: at what price does underwater become unsustainable, and who decides when conviction turns into capitulation? For now, the market has rendered its verdict through mNAV: premiums for profitable treasuries, discounts for underwater ones, and steep discounts for those without clear exit ramps. The paper loss leaderboard isn't static. It recalibrates with every $1,000 move in Bitcoin, and the next leg down will determine whether these treasuries are value traps or cycle survivors. Mentioned in this article Posted in29:T1824,Bitcoin rebounded 11%, but $540 million long leverage raises 25% downside risk toward $48,800. Long-term holder selling surged from 2,300 BTC to 246,000 BTC, up nearly 10,500%. Exchange supply fell from 1.23 million to 1.22 million BTC, signaling early buy-the-dip behavior. Bitcoin’s recent rebound has revived the buy-the-dip narrative, but the data tells a more complicated story. After falling nearly 15% and briefly touching the $60,000 zone, the Bitcoin price bounced more than 11%, drawing traders back into long positions. At first glance, the bounce looks encouraging. However, bearish chart patterns, rising leverage, and fragile spot demand suggest the market may not be out of danger yet. With a potential 25% downside still in play, the latest bounce is now facing serious scrutiny. Bear Flag, Rising Leverage, and Falling Exchange Supply Signal Risky Optimism Bitcoin’s short-term risk is already visible on the 4-hour chart. Sponsored Sponsored After the sharp sell-off toward $60,000, the Bitcoin price formed a rebound structure that now resembles a bear flag pattern. This setup typically appears when the price pauses after a strong drop before continuing lower. If the lower trendline breaks, the pattern points to a downside move of nearly 25%, targeting the $48,000–$49,000 zone. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . Bearish BTC Structure: TradingView Despite this technical warning, leverage is rising again. Following the 11.18% rebound, more than $540 million in new long positions were built on Binance alone. This shows that traders are once again using heavy leverage, betting that the bottom is already in. Similar behavior has p receded major liquidations in past downturns. Long Leverage Comes Back: Coinglass At the same time, spot market behavior reflects a growing buy-the-dip mindset. Bitcoin supply on exchanges fell from around 1.23 million BTC to 1.22 million BTC between February 5 and February 6. This decline suggests that traders are withdrawing coins, possibly for short-term holding, expecting higher prices. BTC Supply Dips: Santiment Public figures and social media sentiment have also turned more optimistic, reinforcing the ‘Buy-the-Dip’ narrative. Sponsored Sponsored Buying $2,000,000 of btc at 67,000. Bookmark this. — Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) February 5, 2026 Together, these signals possibly show misplaced confidence. A fragile chart pattern, rising leverage, and early dip buying are forming at the same time. When optimism builds before structural weakness is resolved, downside risk often increases rather than fades. Long-Term Holders Keep Selling as Realized Price Support Comes Into Focus While short-term traders are turning bullish, long-term holders, the most stable folks, are moving in the opposite direction. The Long-Term Holder Net Position Change, which tracks the 30-day supply shift among investors holding for more than one year, has remained deeply negative since early January. On January 6, this metric showed net selling of around 2,300 BTC. By February 5, that figure had worsened to roughly 246,000 BTC. Long-Term Holders Selling: Glassnode This represents a nearly 10,500% increase in long-term distribution in just one month. In simple terms, the most conviction-driven investors are still reducing exposure. Sponsored Sponsored This behavior becomes more concerning when combined with the long-term holder realized price. The realized price represents the average acquisition cost of coins held by long-term investors. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or falls below this level, it signals deep market stress. In past cycles, major rallies only began after the price stabilized around this zone; however, not immediately. Currently, the long-term holder realized price sits near $40,260. Key Support Level: Bitcoin Magazine As Bitcoin moves closer to this level, more long-term investors approach breakeven. If the price drops below it, many enter losses, often accelerating capitulation. This dynamic played out in late 2022 before the final bear market bottom formed. So far, that reset has not happened. Long-term holders are still selling, not accumulating. Their realized price is becoming a key downside magnet. This suggests the market has not completed its full deleveraging and redistribution phase. Sponsored Sponsored Key Bitcoin Price Levels Show Why $48,000 and $40,000 Matter Next All technical and on-chain signals now converge around a few critical price zones. On the downside, the first major support sits near $53,350. A failure here would expose the $48,800 region, which aligns with the bear flag target and prior consolidation zones. If $48,800 breaks, attention shifts to the long-term holder realized price near $40,260. This zone represents the deepest structural support in the current cycle. A move into this region would indicate broad capitulation among long-term investors and confirm a deeper bear phase. Bitcoin Price Analysis: TradingView In a worst-case scenario, extended weakness could even open the door toward $37,180, based on longer-term projections and historical support clusters. On the upside, Bitcoin must reclaim $69,510 on a sustained 4-hour closing basis to regain short-term credibility. A move above $73,320 would be required to invalidate the bearish pattern. Until that happens, rallies remain vulnerable. With leverage rebuilding, long-term holders still selling, and critical support levels approaching, the current rebound lacks structural confirmation. Under these conditions, buy-the-dip strategies remain exposed to sharp reversals rather than sustained upside.

The cryptocurrency has avoided severe sell-offs that impacted many assets, and its daily chart now displays a classic bullish reversal candlestick pattern. This pattern, characterized by a long downside wick and strong buying near local lows, typically signals that sellers are losing control as demand begins to absorb supply. Additionally, a false breakdown from a tightening wedge formation has created conditions for a potential rebound as short positions close and buyers enter at discounted prices. Compared to Bitcoin, SHIB has shown resilience during recent market turbulence, maintaining its structure within a wider range while BTC broke below significant support levels. If SHIB successfully breaks above short-term moving averages (current resistance levels), analysts suggest a potential 20-30% recovery could be possible, though it remains uncertain whether this early recovery attempt will develop into a sustained rally or succumb to renewed selling pressure.2b:Tab3,Cover image via U.Today Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

After weeks of persistent downward pressure, Shiba Inu may be nearing a pivotal moment as recent price action starts to show early indications of a possible bullish reversal . Even though the entire cryptocurrency market is still brittle after Bitcoin's dramatic decline, SHIB has avoided the worst sell-off stages that impacted numerous important assets, creating space for a technical rebound scenario to emerge. Shiba Inu can reverse Following a protracted decline, SHIB has produced a traditional bullish reversal candlestick structure on the daily chart. With a long downside work and buyers stepping in forcefully close to local lows, the most recent candle demonstrates a strong rejection of lower prices. This pattern usually signals a short-term reversal or relief rally as sellers are losing control, as supply starts to be absorbed by demand. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView Additionally, the price action comes after a breakdown from a tightening wedge formation, where buying interest at lower levels swiftly overtook selling pressure that had initially increased. False breakdowns like these frequently serve as catalysts for rebounds when short positions are closed and buyers enter the market at a discount, trapping late sellers. HOT Stories It is not that bad Crucially, interest should also be paid to SHIB's performance in comparison to Bitcoin. During the recent market turbulence, Bitcoin broke below historically significant support zones, but SHIB did not collapse as catastrophically. In contrast, the token's structure remained consistent across its wider range, indicating that downside exhaustion might be nearer than many traders suspected.

If market conditions stabilize , a successful move above these technical barriers may pave the way for a possible recovery of 20-30%. As of right now, SHIB is displaying one of its most obvious reversal signals in recent days. Only time will tell if this early attempt at recovery develops into a more robust comeback or fades due to fresh selling pressure.2c:T9bc,ACCM, a contracts for differences (CFD) broker focused on emerging markets, has entered motor racing, but not through the usual Formula 1 deals. Instead, it has become a multi-year sponsor of the Prima Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team.
Is MotoGP Going to Be the Next F1 for CFD Brokers?
Although a handful of other retail brokers have marketed their brands around top two-wheeler racing, it has yet to become mainstream like Formula 1. This also suggests that brokers can secure MotoGP sponsorship deals at a much lower cost than Formula 1 ones.
Although none of the Formula One teams or the brokers have officially revealed the financial terms of their deals, Libertex’s Chief Marketing Officer, Marios Chailis, said that the lowest-tier F1 sponsorship deal costs about $5 million.

“Partnering with Prima Pramac Yamaha allows us to connect our brand with a sport that reflects how modern trading works: fast-moving, data-driven, and powered by innovation,” said Tien Ching, CEO of ACCM, in a statement. This also highlights how the target customers of CFD brokers often align with motor racing fans.
Getting Exposure Is the Goal
ACCM operates under regulatory licences in Australia and South Africa, along with offshore licences in Seychelles and Vanuatu. According to SimilarWeb data, most of the brokerage’s website traffic comes from Vietnam and Thailand.
The latest sponsorship deal has made the broker the MotoGP team’s “Official Partner”, allowing it to place its branding across team assets and digital platforms. The broker will also gain access to a “range of other significant rights”.
The Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team also has a large social media following, with 560,000 followers on Instagram and another 560,000 on Facebook, meaning any promotion of the broker would reach a wide audience worldwide.
In addition, sponsor brands can gain visibility on MotoGP’s wider channels if placed well. These channels have more than 17.9 million followers on Instagram and over 7 million subscribers on YouTube.
While football and Formula 1 remain the top sports marketing choices for CFD brokers, many are now turning to niche local sports to better target their key markets. The number of broker deals with individuals and teams in mixed martial arts, cricket, rugby, and other niche sports continues to grow.

Robert Kiyosaki, a financial guru and the author of the well-known bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad, has posted a new tweet, engaging his followers in a dialogue about Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, rather than seeing a positive reaction, Kiyosaki faced severe criticism from the crypto community. Kiyosaki waits for new Bitcoin bottom to buy more In his tweet, Robert Kiyosaki mentioned four major assets that have been in the news a lot recently – gold, silver, Bitcoin, and the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. Kiyosaki claimed that he has not been buying any of the first three assets recently, stating that he had stopped accumulating gold at $300, silver at $60, and Bitcoin at $6,000. HOT Stories He reminded the community that recently he has had to sell some of his Bitcoin and gold, adding that he hates doing it. The reason is: “I hate paying capital gain taxes.” Although in an earlier tweet, Kiyosaki mentioned that he had done that to buy a new house. Now, Kiyosaki stated, he is waiting for new bottoms where prices would make it acceptable for him to start buying gold and Bitcoin again. He said that he would spread the word on X when he began buying gold and digital gold again. “I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold and Bitcoin, then I may buy again.” AS I POSTED on X earlier. I stopped buying silver at $60. I stopped buying Bitcoin at $6000. I stopped buying gold at $300. I have sold some Bitcoin and some gold. I hate selling because I hate paying capital gain taxes. Today…. I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 6, 2026 As for Ethereum, he revealed that he has enough of it for now but he plans to acquire more. You Might Also Like X crypto community bashes Kiyosaki However, the crypto community did not take this message positively this time. First of all, the Community Notes, a local fact-checking service powered by X users, accused Kiyosaki of lying. The Community Notes stated that Kiyosaki recently tweeted, saying he was buying Bitcoin – he published that tweet on January 23 this year . That was the tweet when he stated that he does not care about the price of Bitcoin or gold going up or down: “I just keep buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum and get richer.” Back then, BTC was trading at roughly $90,000 per coin. You're such a lying grifter holy cow. You've been pumping all 3 of these non stop daily for years and now you claim you were never buying? How you didn't win the financial charlatan of the year award, I'll never understand pic.twitter.com/gv6D9mNLM4 — Mark McGrath (@MarkMcGrathCFP) February 6, 2026 Several commentators also reacted in a similar way, saying that Kiyosaki should stop deceiving people or that there is no way to verify that Kiyosaki’s claims of buying BTC, silver, and gold at low prices, even though they sound quite impressive.2f:T43d,Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows totaling nearly $1 billion over two days, with $434 million in net outflows on Thursday following $545 million in redemptions the previous day. These outflows coincided with Bitcoin's price briefly touching $60,000 for the first time since October 2024, leaving net weekly outflows at approximately $690 million despite Monday's $561 million in inflows. The ETFs are facing criticism for potentially undermining Bitcoin's scarcity by creating a "fractional reserve price system" where the same BTC can support multiple financial products simultaneously.

Total assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs currently stand at about $81 billion, with cumulative net flows totaling $54.3 billion. Meanwhile, altcoin ETFs showed mixed performance, with ETH funds experiencing $80.8 million in outflows, while XRP and SOL ETFs saw minor inflows of $4.8 million and $2.8 million respectively. The debate continues over whether the institutionalization of Bitcoin through ETFs has ultimately benefited or harmed the cryptocurrency's fundamental value proposition.30:Tb8b,Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to see outflows on Thursday, shedding almost $1 billion over the past two days as debate grows over their potential impact on the market. Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs recorded $434 million in net outflows on Thursday, following $545 million in redemptions the previous day. Monday’s $561 million in inflows was not enough to offset losses, leaving net weekly outflows at about $690 million as of Friday morning. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows since Monday. Source: SoSoValue The latest withdrawals came amid a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price, which briefly touched $60,000 for the first time since October 2024, according to CoinGecko. The community has struggled to identify clear catalysts for the downturn, and some have started to criticize Bitcoin ETFs even as analysts point to their resilience . ETFs face “paper Bitcoin” criticism The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was one of the most anticipated events in Bitcoin history, and was widely expected to accelerate BTC adoption through institutionalization. Some analysts, however, argue that the institutionalization of Bitcoin via ETFs may have done more harm than good, claiming it contributed to undermining the asset’s scarcity — a key feature of Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins . “The same 1 BTC can now support an ETF unit, a future contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, a structured note. All at once,” Bob Kendall, technical analyst and author of The Kendall Report, said in a Wednesday X post. “That is not a market. That is a fractional reserve price system,” he added. Source: Bob Kendall Kendall’s concerns echo those previously raised by his peers about Bitcoin ETFs becoming a tool for Wall Street to “trade against” Bitcoin. Before crypto ETFs launched, Josef Tětek, a Bitcoin analyst at hardware wallet provider Trezor, warned that such products could enable the “creation of millions of unbacked Bitcoin,” potentially depressing the value of actual Bitcoin.

This historic BRICS trade turnover achievement underscores the bloc’s growing influence as BRICS economic growth accelerates through strategic expansion and also deepening trade integration among member states. The BRICS trade turnover figures represent years of coordination between Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and the newer members who joined the alliance. Also Read: Dollar Will Fall As 40+ Countries Are Ready to Accept BRICS Unit BRICS Economic Growth And Global Trade Power Shift Source: iStock Experts are seeing the record-breaking BRICS trade turnover as a result of unique economic complementarity among member nations, and also through strategic integration. They have called this development “ a historic event that changes the balance of power in the world ,” according to reports from TV BRICS. The BRICS expansion impact became evident and visible as new members—including the UAE, Ethiopia, Iran, and Egypt—integrated into the bloc’s established trade networks at the time of writing. This BRICS global trade shift reflects broader changes in how emerging economies are coordinating their commercial relationships. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva emphasized the significance of the bloc’s trade performance at the BRICS Business Forum, stating: “In 2023, based on the most recent available data, intra-BRICS trade reached approximately USD 1 trillion—accounting for 20% of the bloc’s total exports and 30% of its aggregate imports. Accordingly, strengthening cooperation is deemed essential to advancing productive integration.” Member Nations Drive Record Trade Integration China remained the dominant force within the group at the time of writing, accounting for approximately 64% of the bloc’s overall exports, and also maintaining strategic leadership across various major sectors. India registered landmark achievements with total external trade hitting US$825.25 billion for the fiscal year. Russia’s bilateral trade with China alone accelerated beyond the US$200 billion mark for the third consecutive year in 2025, and its trade with the BRICS bloc specifically grew to roughly US$399 billion by late 2024. These individual contributions combined to push the overall BRICS trade turnover past the trillion-dollar threshold, pioneering certain critical benchmarks. The comparison between BRICS vs G7 economy now reveals widening differences in growth trajectories and also in overall economic momentum. The BRICS+ share of global GDP at purchasing power parity reached approximately 39.2% by late 2025, and this continues to surpass the G7’s declining portion in the global economy. Economists are projecting the BRICS economic growth rates at around 3.8% for 2025—which is more than triple the G7’s projected 1.1% growth rate, and this continues to surpass the G7’s declining portion in the global economy. BRICS Global Trade Shift Challenges Traditional Powers President Lula also addressed the broader implications of this ongoing BRICS global trade shift when he spoke about the role emerging economies should play, declaring: “In the wake of rising protectionism, it is incumbent upon emerging nations to uphold the multilateral trading system and pursue reform of the international financial architecture. BRICS continues to serve as guarantor of a promising future. The fight against inequality reinforces consumer markets, stimulates trade, and drives investment.” Future Growth Projections Show Widening Gap Source: Watcher.Guru The massive BRICS trade turnover milestone signals something bigger than just trade figures—it’s also reflecting a fundamental restructuring of international economic relationships and established trade patterns. The BRICS expansion impact extends into areas such as logistics infrastructure, digital economy development, and also regional connectivity initiatives that partners have prioritized moving forward. Also Read: BRICS: BCA Reports If the US Dollar’s Supremacy Will Last or Perish The gap between BRICS vs G7 economy performance is expected to widen further by 2028, with projections showing BRICS trade turnover continuing its upward trajectory. The bloc now represents roughly 45% of the world’s population and controls over 40% of global oil production following its 2024 expansion. As new members continue integrating and existing partners deepen commercial ties, the BRICS trade turnover influence on international trade patterns is expected to expand even more in the coming years.32:Te0c,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 In the current scenario, the key question is whether the market has actually bottomed. Historically, early bottoming signals tend to include investor profit-taking, clear signs of seller exhaustion, and an asset becoming deeply oversold. Is Bitcoin [BTC] exhibiting any of these signals? From a technical standpoint, BTC’s RSI is deeply oversold, dropping to around 15. This move aligns with Bitcoin’s roughly 33% correction from the $97k peak. Against this setup, BTC ’s 4% intraday jump from $60k hints at a potential local bottom. However, the key question is whether on-chain metrics confirm this view. If not, the bounce could quickly turn into a bull trap. Market questions BTC’s true bottom Despite early signals, the market still doesn’t seem fully convinced. On one side, analysts argue that Bitcoin’s current pullback is simply an “extension” of the 2025 bear phase, even though BTC printed a new all-time high near $126k during the cycle. So, what is this divergence signaling? By this view, BTC has continued to underperform since the start of 2025 despite the ATH, falling 33% versus the S&P500, 58% versus gold, and 26% relative to M2 expansion. Source: TradingView (BTC/Gold) In simple terms, analysts believe Bitcoin may now be carving out a bottom, supported by its 30% correction since early 2025. Under this view, the bear phase could be nearing an end, with $60k acting as a base for a reversal. However, skeptics argue that $60k may mark the start of a deeper move. Historically, Bitcoin bear markets have followed a pattern of deep but shrinking declines. If this trend continues, a potential 2026 bottom near a 70% drop from the $126k ATH would place Bitcoin around the $38k level. This sets up a key strategic question for the market: Are participants positioning to accumulate the “dip,” or reducing exposure before a deeper correction pushes PnL further into the red and extends the bear phase? Bitcoin’s recovery case weakens as structural stress builds The road to recovery for Bitcoin HODLers doesn’t look immediate. According to Glassnode data , more than 9.3 million BTC are underwater, the highest level since January 2023. Put simply, a large portion of holders are sitting on unrealized losses, putting market conviction under pressure. At the same time, Bitcoin has dropped below its estimated electrical cost near $77k. When price falls beneath this level, mining becomes less profitable , increasing capitulation risk during late-stage bear markets. Source: X Taken together, Bitcoin now needs a clear catalyst to absorb supply, reignite FOMO, and restore HODLing conviction among underwater holders. The key issue is that a strong institutional bid still hasn’t returned. From a macro perspective, this sets up a classic supply-demand imbalance, with available supply outpacing demand. Rising capitulation risk only strengthens this dynamic, further discouraging long-term holding. In this context, BTC’s structure doesn’t yet confirm $60k as a bottom. The result? Bitcoin’s 4% intraday bounce could fade into another fakeout, potentially triggering long liquidations and sending price back toward the $50k zone, keeping the broader $38k bottom thesis firmly in play. Final Thoughts Despite BTC’s 4% intraday bounce and early technical signals, on-chain stress, miner pressure, and unrealized losses suggest the $60k level is not yet a firm floor. Historical patterns and macro supply-demand imbalances indicate Bitcoin could revisit the $50k zone, keeping the $38k bottom thesis in play.33:Td4f,MYX price rallies 32% despite Bitcoin crashing near $65,000 levels. Strong spot inflows contrast with negative funding rates signaling trader caution. Holding $5.99 support keeps upside toward $7.49 resistance intact. MYX Finance has defied broader market weakness with a sharp rally, gaining strong upside momentum over the past week. The surge reflects sustained investor confidence despite Bitcoin’s drop toward $65,000. While demand remains firm, emerging resistance levels suggest MYX’s upside may face near-term constraints if momentum weakens. MYX Investors’ Inflows Counter Market Sell-Off Market indicators show MYX is benefiting from steady capital inflows. The Chaikin Money Flow, which tracks buying and selling pressure, has crossed above the zero line. This shift places MYX in the positive zone , a signal commonly associated with accumulation and strengthening investor participation. Sponsored Sponsored Positive CMF readings often support price recoveries during volatile periods. In MYX’s case, rising inflows suggest buyers are absorbing supply efficiently. This behavior reinforces bullish sentiment and supports price stability, even as broader crypto markets struggle to regain footing. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . MYX CMF. Source: TradingView Despite strong spot demand, derivatives data signals caution. MYX’s funding rate has dropped sharply into negative territory. This move reflects the growing dominance of short positions over longs. Futures traders appear increasingly skeptical about the sustainability of MYX’s rally . The decline in funding rates occurred as prices continued to rise. Such divergence often suggests traders are positioning for a pullback rather than chasing upside. Elevated short interest can pressure price stability, especially if bullish momentum slows or broader market conditions deteriorate further. MYX Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass MYX Price Pushes Further MYX price has climbed 32% over the past six days and trades near $6.40 at the time of writing. The token remains above the $5.99 support, which has acted as a key demand zone. MYX has outperformed the broader market, with major assets posting losses. Sustaining this momentum depends on continued investor conviction. Ongoing inflows are necessary to offset derivatives-driven skepticism. The immediate objective for MYX is reclaiming $6.87 as support. Securing that level could allow the price to advance toward the $7.49 resistance zone. MYX Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risks remain if sentiment shifts. A renewed Bitcoin sell-off could weigh on MYX , even if correlation stays limited. Failure to hold current support may trigger a gradual pullback. Such a move would erase part of the recent gains and invalidate the bullish thesis and fall through $5.99 to slide to $5.27 or lower.

Rising liquidations boosted fees, revenue, and buybacks, creating unique downside protection mechanism. Coinbase listing and institutional access strengthened liquidity, though unlock risks remain ahead. Hyperliquid (HYPE) has moved against the broader market since the start of the year, supported by several internal and distinctive drivers. Analysts observe that liquidation losses have actually helped push HYPE’s price higher. How long can HYPE continue to outperform the market?

TradingView data shows that since mid-last month, the total crypto market capitalization has fallen from $3.2 trillion to $2.2 trillion. Over the same period, HYPE rose 60%, from $20.6 to $33.6.

Recent reports from BeInCrypto attribute part of this momentum to a sharp surge in trading volume for HIP-3 futures contracts on Hyperliquid . Grayscale Research highlights a boom in perpetual futures trading for non-crypto assets on Hyperliquid earlier this year. The platform recorded a seven-day average trading volume exceeding $900 million. HIP-3 Futures Contracts Volume on Hyperliquid. Source: Grayscale In addition, Ripple Prime has opened institutional access to Hyperliquid ’s on-chain derivatives tools. This move supports liquidity and broader adoption. Sponsored Sponsored Another development strengthened HYPE on February 5, a day marked by the most fearful market sentiment in a year. Coinbase officially enabled HYPE trading , leaving the token largely unaffected by the broader sell-off. A listing on a major exchange like Coinbase boosted liquidity and demand. It attracted both institutional and retail investors. This allowed HYPE to absorb selling pressure and even extend gains while the market declined. “Coinbase is listing HYPE! There are two nuances for this listing: This is likely a precursor for spot HYPE ETFs to begin trading since Coinbase is the custodian. US investors still have trouble getting HYPE exposure; a Coinbase listing alleviates that.” — Steven.hl, Yunt Capital, said . Some analysts add that HYPE’s absence from Binance may be an advantage. It may help the token avoid widespread sell-offs. Investor MartyParty notes that HYPE is the only Layer-1 asset not listed on Binance. As a result, it has avoided being pulled into this “liquidity hunt.” Why Do Larger Liquidations Push HYPE Higher? Other analysts argue that HYPE’s price story runs deeper.

This figure was slightly lower than Bybit’s, but higher than Binance’s. Exchange Liquidations. Source: Coinglass Analysts explain that heavier liquidations tend to support HYPE’s price because of a fee-revenue-based buyback mechanism . High liquidation volume means higher trading volume, which drives higher fee revenue. DefiLlama data shows that on February 5, Hyperliquid generated $7.49 million in fees and $6.84 million in revenue. This marked the highest level since the market crash on October 10 last year. Hyperliquid’s Fee & Revenue. Source: DefiLlama Sponsored Sponsored For most projects, market crashes reduce revenue. Hyperliquid, as an exchange, benefits from liquidation activity instead. This dynamic directly impacts the price of HYPE. Data from Hyperscreener shows that more than 160,000 HYPE tokens were bought back on February 5. This was the highest level since the October 10 market dump. HYPE Amount Buybacks Per Day. Source: Hyperscreener This structure gives HYPE a unique mechanism to counter negative market pressure. “The recent uptick here is most likely due to a lot of liquidations, which tend to drive significant fees and revenue.” — Analyst Thor said . However, focusing too heavily on positive narratives may cause investors to overlook risks. On February 6, 9.92 million HYPE tokens are scheduled to unlock . In addition, negative market sentiment may persist and could outweigh HYPE’s positive catalysts. The latest analysis from BeInCrypto emphasizes the importance of the $30 level . Price action above or below this threshold will form the basis for predicting HYPE’s next move this month.

Daily UNI token burns hit record highs as Uniswap trading fees and activity surge. UNI price drops 15% despite whale accumulation and strong on-chain fundamentals. Bitwise Investments has taken a major step toward bringing Uniswap (UNI) to the broader financial market, filing an S-1 registration with the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) for a spot Uniswap ETF. The announcement marks a potential milestone for UNI adoption in institutional portfolios, yet the token’s price still struggles.

The proposed fund, if approved, would track UNI’s spot price, excluding expenses, with Coinbase Custody serving as the custodian . At launch, the ETF would not include staking, signaling a straightforward exposure product for investors. The filing coincides with notable on-chain activity. Daily UNI burns have surged sharply in February, according to Dune Analytics, alongside higher Uniswap trading fees. As of early February, over 100 million UNI tokens have been burned, valued at approximately $597 million, with the annualized burn rate exceeding $36 million. Daily UNI Burns.

This highlights confidence in UNI’s medium-term upside. However, analysts remain divided on whether the Fee Switch’s early performance justifies optimism. BeInCrypto reported in December that initial revenue from the Fee Switch fell short of governance expectations , with some analysts questioning whether the early data reflects flawed assumptions or simply incomplete rollout effects. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams cautioned that “conclusions are premature and based on misleading assumptions,” suggesting the protocol’s long-term revenue potential may not yet be fully realized. Nah the analysis is just wrong, overeager and misleading 1) treasury burned uni approx equal to what would have been the case if it had been on the whole time 2) only a subset of fee sources have turned on so far.

Most major altcoins, including Ethereum and Solana, have also fallen. However, despite the overall decline, a few tokens are moving in the opposite direction, drawing investor attention. Two projects in particular: Hyperliquid’s HYPE token and Canton’s CC token, have shown little gains while much of the market remains in the red. Hyperliquid (HYPE) rises on strong platform activity Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, has surged roughly 50% over the past two weeks, standing out during a period when many cryptocurrencies have dropped. The token’s rise appears to be driven by increased activity on the Hyperliquid trading platform. The exchange recently captured a measurable share of global silver trading volume shortly after listing the asset, boosting trading demand. Since all trading fees on the platform are paid in HYPE, higher trading activity directly increases demand for the token. Institutional attention has also supported sentiment, with major asset managers reportedly exploring exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings linked to the project. In addition, new integrations within other blockchain ecosystems have expanded trading access, improving liquidity and visibility. A recent platform upgrade allowing traders to hedge positions using shared margin has further increased trading efficiency, leading to higher trading volumes, rising open interest, and stronger daily platform revenues — all factors that helped push the token higher even as the broader market declined. Canton (CC) gains as institutional adoption grows Another token outperforming the market is Canton’s CC token, which recently reached a new all-time high and climbed more than 30% in recent weeks. Unlike many retail-focused crypto projects, Canton is designed primarily for institutional finance. Several large financial institutions are already building on or testing the network, including major global banks and financial infrastructure providers. The platform is also being used in tokenization initiatives such as digital government securities, strengthening its institutional relevance. A driver behind the token’s performance is its supply-reduction mechanism. Institutions using the network’s global synchronizer system must burn CC tokens during transactions, steadily reducing circulating supply. With hundreds of thousands of transactions occurring daily, this burn mechanism has created additional upward pressure on price, especially as institutional activity continues to grow.

The move followed Bitcoin’s drop to around $60,000, which triggered another wave of risk reduction and forced liquidations. In the latest flush, more than $1.85 billion in long positions were wiped out, setting a cautious tone for large-cap altcoins, including XRP. There was no XRP-specific trigger behind the decline. Instead, traders stepped back as volatility stayed high and dip buying remained weak. With leverage still unwinding and confidence shaken, short-term bounces in XRP have struggled to hold. For now, price action remains tied to broader market stability, with traders waiting for signs of exhaustion in selling before positioning for any meaningful recovery. Current XRP Price Position Today XRP extended its decline over the past 24 hours, dropping 9.77% to trade near $1.30. The sell-off intensified after the token failed to hold the $1.50 support, triggering a sharp pullback during the previous trading session. The downside move dragged XRP as low as $1.13, a level not seen even during the October 2025 sell-off, highlighting the severity of the breakdown. As the price slipped below $1.50, trading volume began to rise after remaining relatively flat near $4 billion since the start of the month. Volume spiked sharply as XRP marked its lows, surging past $10 billion and later climbing above $13 billion as the price rebounded. This increase in activity suggests bullish participation near the lows, with buyers stepping in to defend the range. The rebound has pushed XRP back toward $1.30, where it is now attempting to stabilize. However, upside momentum remains capped. Strong overhead resistance continues to limit recovery attempts, keeping bearish risks firmly in play despite the bounce from recent lows. XRP Price Analysis for this Week—Can XRP Still Plunge Below $1? XRP went through a similar sell-off in October 2025, when long liquidations crossed $612 million. The current pullback, however, appears technically deeper, even though long liquidations so far remain below $60 million. This imbalance suggests the weakness is being driven less by forced exits or external shocks and more by a clean technical breakdown and fading trader confidence. With liquidation pressure still relatively contained, sellers continue to control price action, leaving XRP vulnerable to further downside. Unless buyers step in decisively, the token remains exposed to a move below the $1.00 level in the near term. As seen on the chart, XRP has rebounded from the $1.05–$1.15 range, a zone where buyers previously stepped in during November 2023 and pushed the price toward a peak near $2.91. That historical reaction highlights the importance of this demand area. However, the current rebound looks different. Despite visible buying interest, XRP has struggled to move decisively higher and remains pinned close to support. More importantly, open interest continues to decline, suggesting the move lacks strong bullish backing. The rebound appears to be driven largely by short liquidations, rather than fresh long positions entering the market. As contracts continue to close even as price ticks higher, it signals ongoing deleveraging and a lack of conviction among traders. For now, $1.05 remains a critical line of defense. A clean break below this level could open the door to a deeper correction. Conclusion XRP’s recent rebound offers short-term relief, but the underlying signals remain mixed. While buyers have defended the $1.05–$1.15 zone, the lack of follow-through and falling open interest suggests the recovery is being driven more by short covering than genuine demand. Until fresh long positions enter the market and momentum improves, the bounce risks fading. For now, XRP remains at a critical juncture, where holding key support could stabilise price, but a breakdown would likely trigger renewed downside pressure.

This crash erased months of gains and brought prices back to pre-US election levels from late 2024. According to analysis from the Kobeissi Letter, this appears to be part of a structural market shift that began on October 10, when $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out, fundamentally breaking market sentiment that has not recovered.

The analysts note that Bitcoin's market depth remains more than 30% below its October peak, similar to levels seen after the FTX crash in 2022, and suggest a large institutional player may have been liquidated during this violent trading session. While the market continues to suffer, analysts believe we may be approaching a bottom when "structural liquidity is restored," which will require capitulation in both price and leverage alongside maximum bearish sentiment.3b:T10cd,Analysts explain what took place in the crypto markets in the past 24 hours or so, and whether the worst is behind us. It’s safe to say that this is no longer a bull phase. After all, BTC dumped by more than 50% since its October all-time high and plummeted to around $60,000 late on Thursday. But in this article, we will focus more on the events that took place yesterday than on the overall decline over the past several months. In the span of just 24 hours, the cryptocurrency plummeted from $77,000 to $60,000 in one of its worst single-day trading performances since its inception. Multiple altcoins registered even more profound losses of up to 20%, as was the case with XRP. The total value of wrecked positions in just one day shot up to $2.6 billion, according to Coinglass data. Nearly 600,000 traders were liquidated. Despite bouncing off local lows, BTC and the altcoins erased months and years of gains, returning to levels last seen before the US presidential elections at the end of 2024. During and after similar calamities, the most obvious question is why. Here’s a breakdown through the eyes of the Kobeissi Letter. What Happened? First things first, the analyst reassured that although bitcoin has plummeted by over $30,000 in the past couple of months, the “fundamental picture for crypto” has remained “vastly unchanged.” They added that the answer to why the asset class is tanking lies in the October 10 crash, when over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out . They believe “something structural” changed on that day. The answer to this question requires going back to October 10th. The most recent TOP in crypto came on October 6th, just 4 days before the -$19.5 billion record liquidation. Something structural appears to have shifted on October 10th. And, markets never truly recovered. pic.twitter.com/l07mKRBAbQ — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 5, 2026 Although BTC remained entirely rangebound for two months between November 15 and January 15, the analysts said there were brief periods of liquidation with “gaps” in both directions, which were another sign of the market’s structural collapse. They noted that sentiment is “all that matters” during crypto cycles, and it was broken after the October crash.

Analysts Explain Why BTC Just Crashed to $65K and Where the Bottom Lies “The result is a massive virtuous cycle, shifting from liquidations to sentiment deterioration, and back. Since January 24th, we have seen $10 billion worth of levered positions liquidated. That’s ~55% of the record amount seen on October 10th. It’s a structural decline.” The analysts offered more evidence showing the nature of the structural collapse, including the spread of selling pressure into other asset classes, and that BTC’s market depth, the capital available to absorb large orders, is still more than 30% below its October peak. The latest time it hit such numbers was after the FTX crash in 2022. Lastly, the Kobeissi Letter indicated that a large player, perhaps an institution, sold or was liquidated during the violent trading session, given BTC’s rapid and massive correction. Today’s decline was particularly noteworthy as Bitcoin fell over -$9,000 and selling pressure was constant. At times, Bitcoin would fall $2,000+ in a matter of minutes. It seems that a large player, perhaps an institutional investor, sold/liquidated during today’s session. pic.twitter.com/EWnLxUT1Vl — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 5, 2026 When Bottom? The second popular question after a crypto market collapse is whether we have bottomed out or if there is more pain ahead. The analysts answered that bitcoin would bottom once “structural liquidity is restored.” “This will be a combination of both capitulation in price and leverage, as well as maximum bearish sentiment.” The good news is that they added, “we seem to be somewhat near that point.” SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer).

Charles Hoskinson has lost over $3 billion in crypto but has chosen to stay committed, regardless of recent market losses, the founder of Cardano said during a Thursday livestream. “It’s easy for you to say, Charles, you’re rich. You can ride it out. I’ve lost more money than anyone listening to this, over $3 billion now,” Hoskinson said . “It’d have been real easy to cash out. Just walk away. And do you think I honestly care if I lose it all? Do you think I’m doing this for money? You’re pretty mistaken if you do.” Hoskinson emphasized that he is not motivated by personal gains and has avoided major scandals like the FTX fallout or the Epstein files by consistently turning down questionable opportunities and prioritizing integrity over access or influence. He previously criticized some industry leaders for accepting the flawed CLARITY Act in exchange for power, wealth, and elite status. Commenting on market conditions, Hoskinson encouraged the crypto community to endure the “red days” and focus on collaboration and continued development. “It’ll get worse. It’ll get redder. It is what it is. But at the end of the day, are you having fun? Find a way to. And know that each and every one of you in the cryptocurrency space, you’re doing something that matters. You’re doing something that has the potential to change the world,” he said. On Cardano, Hoskinson expressed optimism about the project’s infrastructure, governance, and future commercialization despite the downturn, with projects like Hydra, Leios, and Midnight showing development progress. Hoskinson co-founded Ethereum before leaving the project in 2014. He launched Cardano in 2017 through IOG with a focus on scientific research and sustainable blockchain design. In his remarks last night, Hoskinson also praised Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko as allies in advancing crypto adoption.3d:Td56,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 The altcoin market has been crashing hard since last week. In fact, major altcoins from different sectors have graced the list of the market’s biggest losers over the last 24 hours. On this front, LayerZero has led the way, losing 10% of its valuation during this period. Activity across its network has not only influenced this loss, but also the altcoin’s numerical outlook. ZRO eyes 50% Fibonacci retracement level According to the altcoin’s daily chart, ZRO had faked a breakout above the 0.786 Fibonacci Retracement level only to close below it. The retracement was deduced from 10 October’s crash that saw ZRO create a flash low of $0.315. This suggested that bears had controlled this market for more than three months. LayerZero’s drop for the day extended the weekly losses to 15%. This figure put the altcoin behind only Ripple (XRP) and ZCash (ZEC) in terms of daily losses at press time. Momentum in favour of more downside seemed to be increasing too – A sign that sellers were willing to pull the price further down. The MACD bars, becoming denser as the signal lines crossed over on the downward side, confirmed this observation. This outlook suggested a potential revisit to the 50% retracement level, which coincided with a previous resistance zone. Here, things could change as bulls could come in and view this as a retest for the area. So, caution may be warranted here. Source: ZRO/USDT on TradingView Staying below $1.718 would heighten the chances of a drop to $1.45 or lower. However, these targets could also be viewed as potential reversal points, as they house both major bulls and bears. However, one question must be answered here – Is ZRO declining only because of its weak technical outlook? Retail traders may be selling hard… No. In fact, its on-chain activity has been giving similar vibes. As per data from Etherscan, ZRO has been dropping because of intense selling from retail traders too. A sea of orders worth between $10 and slightly above $100 has been flooding DEX platforms like Uniswap (UNI) . At press time, only a few trades were long – Insignificant in number compared to shorts. Source: Etherscan These findings are evidence of sell pressure from retail traders. Even though their volume has been usually small, they represent the sentiment of the general market. This might explain why the price of ZRO fell on the charts. Transaction activity on LayerZero sliding too! Finally, the transaction activity dipped below noticeable levels too. The number of transaction counts dropped by more than 70% in about three weeks – Down from 3,479 to 981. Additionally, the number of transaction amounts fell from 27.735 million ZRO to 8.137 million ZRO over the same period. Together, these observations suggested that activity has been sliding, accelerating the price drop. Source: Etherscan Here, it’s worth noting that according to popular analyst Benjamin Cowen, the near-term outlook for the market is bearish. What about the rest of the year though? Well, the analyst expects the same for Bitcoin (BTC). He claimed , “BTC goes down and drags the rest of the market with it. Good chance this process ends later this year, so stay tuned!” Final Thoughts ZROs price crashed by 10% on the back of a bear market structure and a fall in network activity. Some analysts expect the bear market to last through 2026.3e:T47f,Santiment reports that extreme fear following Bitcoin's drop to $60,000 helped trigger a rebound toward $65,000, with potential for a rally to $70,000. This came after BTC experienced one of its sharpest daily sell-offs, dropping over $10,000 in a single day for the first time in history, with $2.2 billion in long liquidations. The analytics firm noted that spikes in social media negativity often precede short-term rebounds, though traders remain divided on whether this represents a genuine recovery or a temporary technical reaction.

The downturn has affected the broader crypto market, with major altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB also posting steep losses. Market data shows a mixed picture, with "smart money" taking net short positions while whales and public figures adopt long positions. Bitcoin is currently down nearly 9% in 24 hours and over 21% for the week, with analysts noting the current downturn is developing faster than the 2022 bear market. Despite the extremely bearish sentiment for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, some traders see the concentration of short positions as potential fuel for a move back toward $70,000.3f:Tabe,Santiment รายงานว่าความกลัวสุดขั้วหลังจาก Bitcoin ตกลงสู่ระดับ $60,000 ช่วยกระตุ้นการฟื้นตัวกลับสู่ระดับ $65,000 โดยมีศักยภาพที่จะปรับตัวเพิ่มขึ้นสู่ $70,000 สิ่งนี้เกิดขึ้นหลังจาก BTC ประสบกับการขายลงอย่างรุนแรงในรายวันหนึ่ง โดยร่วงลงกว่า $10,000 ในวันเดียวเป็นครั้งแรกในประวัติศาสตร์ พร้อมด้วยการเรียกเก็บเงิน long position มูลค่า $2.2 พันล้าน บริษัทวิเคราะห์ชี้ให้เห็นว่าการเพิ่มขึ้นของความลบในโซเชียลมีเดียมักจะนำหน้าการฟื้นตัวในระยะสั้น แม้ว่านักเทรดจะยังคงแบ่งแยกกันว่านี่เป็นการฟื้นตัวที่แท้จริงหรือเป็นปฏิกิริยาทางเทคนิคชั่วคราว

การปรับตัวลงนี้ส่งผลกระทบต่อตลาดคริปโตทั่วไป โดย altcoin หลักอย่าง XRP, Ethereum, Solana และ BNB ก็ปรับตัวลงอย่างมีนัยสำคัญเช่นกัน ข้อมูลตลาดแสดงภาพผสมกัน โดย "smart money" ถือ short position ในขณะที่ whales และบุคคลสาธารณะเปิด long position ขณะนี้ Bitcoin ลดลงเกือบ 9% ใน 24 ชั่วโมงและมากกว่า 21% ในรอบสัปดาห์ โดยนักวิเคราะห์ชี้ให้เห็นว่าการปรับตัวลงครั้งนี้ดำเนินไปเร็วกว่าตลาดหมีในปี 2022 แม้จะมีความเป็นหมีขั้วสุดขั้วสำหรับทั้ง Bitcoin และ Ethereum แต่นักเทรดบางคนมองว่าการรวมตัวของ short positions อาจเป็นเชื้อไฟสำหรับการกลับไปสู่ระดับ $70,00040:Te49,Santiment says extreme fear after Bitcoin's $60K drop helped trigger a rebound, with a potential push toward $70K. Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to around $60,000 earlier today before rebounding toward $65,000, following one of the sharpest daily sell-offs in its history. The move has split traders between those calling the rebound a temporary technical reaction and others pointing to extreme fear as a setup for a recovery toward $70,000. Fear Spikes as Bitcoin Rebounds From Sell-Off On February 6, Santiment noted that social media mentions calling for Bitcoin to go “lower” or “below” shot up after the drop to $60,000, a pattern the analytics firm said often appears near short-term price rebounds. The asset did indeed bounce back to about $65,000, with the uptick coming after what The Kobeissi Letter described as BTC’s first-ever daily drop of more than $10,000, alongside claims that a large leveraged position had been liquidated. “Is this nothing but a dead cat bounce?” Santiment asked, while positing that enough retail may have been shaken out to justify a quick rally back up to the $70,000s. The sell-off capped weeks of heavy downside pressure, as CryptoPotato previously reported, with Bitcoin wiping out gains seen after Donald Trump’s re-election and dragging most major altcoins lower. XRP fell 13% on the day, while Ethereum, Solana, and BNB also posted steep losses. Meanwhile, on-chain and derivatives data are painting a mixed picture beneath the rebound. According to DeFi commentator Marvellous, “smart money” has taken a net short position, while whales and public figures are adopting long positions. The market watcher argued the move looked more like a mechanical response after $2.2 billion in long liquidations than renewed conviction, noting that open interest remained elevated and funding rates had stayed flat.

Analysts Explain Why BTC Just Crashed to $65K and Where the Bottom Lies Liquidations Top $1.3 Billion as BTC Plummets Below $67K, ETH Loses $2K Support Elsewhere, trader Sykodelic highlighted a lopsided liquidation map, claiming the market had cleared most long positions, leaving roughly $29 billion in shorts versus about $100 million in longs over a one-year view. Price Action Shows Heavy Damage Despite Short-Term Bounce Bitcoin was trading around the $65,000 level at the time of writing, down nearly 9% in the last 24 hours and more than 21% over the past seven days. Across the previous month, the losses stand close to 30%, pushing BTC about 48% below its peak from October 2025, when it surpassed the $126,000 mark. Analysts from CryptoQuant have said that the current downturn is developing faster than the 2022 bear market, with their data showing the OG cryptocurrency fell 23% within 83 days of losing its 365-day moving average, compared with a 6% decline over the same period in early 2022. Santiment added that sentiment toward both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) had turned “extremely bearish,” a condition that can coincide with short-lived relief rallies when retail fear stays elevated. For now, traders remain divided. Some see the concentration of short positions and fearful sentiment as fuel for a move back toward $70,000, while others have warned that without a collapse in open interest and prolonged sideways trading, the recent bounce may only be the precursor to another test of lower levels.

The token last traded at this price level in November 2024, when XRP’s price was just pick up steam. 2025 was rather bullish for XRP, with prices hitting a new peak of $3.65 in July. However, the asset has been on a downtrend since its 2025 peak, especially after the October market crash. According to CoinGecko data, XRP’s price is down 7.4% in the last 24 hours , 25% in the last week, 30.6% in the 14-day charts, and 41.2% over the previous month. The current trajectory has ignited fears among investors that the popular cryptocurrency could once again dip below the $1 mark. However, dipping below $1 could set the stage for XRP to eventually breach $5. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Source: WatcherGuru The crypto market downtrend was triggered by macroeconomic uncertainties and global geopolitical tensions. However, the liquidity crunch seems to have deepened the cut. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below its 2021 all-time high and could fall below the $60,000 over the coming days. XRP’s price will likely follow BTC’s trajectory. However, BTC seems to follow a pattern of hitting new peaks after a massive pullback. The original crypto fell to $15,000 in 2022, but rose to beyond $100,000 just two years later. XRP’s price will likely follow a similar trajectory. The next bull run could push XRP price to beyond the $5 mark. Additionally, XRP also saw the launch of several spot ETFs in 2025. We could see increased ETF inflows once the bear market is over and investor sentiment returns. ETFs have played a central role in the 2025 market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) hit new peaks thanks to increased ETF inflows. XRP could see a similar pattern in the future. Also Read: How Low Can XRP Price Crash In This Cycle? Hopes For Rebound Telegaon analysts also anticipate XRP to breach the $5 mark sometime this year. Source: Telegaon42:Ta23,Bitwise advisor Jeff Park has taken to the X social media network to outline a rather compelling theory for the recent cryptocurrency carnage. The recent implosion of crypto can be mainly explained by institutional risk management, Park argues. Multi-strategy hedge funds are likely responsible for the extremely aggressive selling. According to Park, they forced a capitulation to satisfy internal risk models. HOT Stories On Friday, the price of BTC collapsed to an intraday low of $60,255, erasing most of its ETF-driven gains. The "fast money" flush As noted by Park, roughly one-third of all Bitcoin ETF shares are owned by institutional players. Approximately 50% of that slice is held by hedge funds. This capital is "fast money" that gets deployed in delta-hedged or relative value (RV) neutral trades rather than long-term directional bets. "That's a decent amount of fast money flows that can capitulate if the cost of funding or margin requirements tick up," Park wrote. Hedge fund risk managers often intervene to "shut risk down" when there is a spike in volatility. Widening spreads and spillovers from growth equity correlations can force them to unwind positions immediately. "To sell when liquidity is as poor as it is is the typical 'shut risk down' behavior we're seeing today," Park noted The analyst has pointed to massive turnover in Strategy (MSTR) stock as further evidence of this institutional scramble. Volatility hits "code red" Park has noted that Bitcoin's implied volatility (IV) has spiked to 75%, a level not seen since the spot ETFs originally launched in early 2024. This is likely to be the main catalyst for this extreme forced selling. "This is the highest level since the ETF launch in 2024. It is also finally higher than gold volatility. Know it's a lot of pain right now, but this is all part of the process required for Bitcoin to make new highs," Park said. You Might Also Like For the first time in a long time, Bitcoin volatility is finally higher than gold volatility. This could end the "low vol" regime that had attracted so much institutional leverage. This is a classic case of "commonholder risk": distinct funds all rush for the same narrow exit door simultaneously. This results in "all downside correlation to one." A fast melt-up Despite the enormous crash, Park remains bullish on the medium-term outcome. He is convinced that the current pain is a necessary "process" to clear out the leverage and weak hands. "If that's true, and when this all clears, I suspect we'll reprice pretty quickly," Park predicted. "The melt-up will be fast."43:Tabf,Jefferies รายงานว่าแม้ Bitcoin และ Ethereum จะซื้อขายใกล้ระดับที่ดึงดูดทางประวัติศาสตร์ แต่ตลาดคริปโตยังไม่แสดงสัญญาณของจุดต่ำที่จะเกิดขึ้นเร็วๆ นี้ ธนาคารกำหนดลักษณะของการแกว่งตัวลงในปัจจุบันว่าเป็นการแก้ไขที่ขับเคลื่อนโดยสภาพคล่องมากกว่าการล่มสลายทางพื้นฐาน โดยระบุว่ากิจกรรมของเครือข่าย blockchain ยังคงมีความยืดหยุ่น Bitcoin ซื้อขายใกล้ระดับ $64,800 (ต่ำกว่า 47% จากจุดสูงสุดในเดือนตุลาคม 2025) ในขณะที่ Ether อยู่ที่ราว $1,900 (ลดลงเกือบ 60% จากระดับสูงสุดในรอบวัฏจักร)

In a research note this week, the bank described the downturn as a liquidity-driven correction rather than a collapse in blockchain activity, pointing instead to continued network usage and selective corporate bitcoin accumulation as evidence that the sector’s underlying infrastructure remains intact. STORY CONTINUES BELOW This comes as bitcoin trades near $64,800 , roughly 47% below its October 2025 peak of about $123,500, while ether trades around $1,900, down nearly 60% from its prior cycle highs. Jefferies wrote that sharp price declines have revived familiar “crypto winter” narratives, but argued that current weakness is more closely tied to broader risk-off sentiment in global markets and a rotation away from growth assets than to any deterioration in blockchain fundamentals. More than $2 billion in recent long liquidations has further amplified day-to-day volatility across major tokens. The bank highlighted selling from large bitcoin holders and persistent spot ETF net outflows as key near-term headwinds, suggesting institutional portfolio rebalancing is exerting greater pressure on prices than retail behavior. At the same time, Jefferies noted that smaller and mid-sized holders appear to be holding existing positions rather than aggressively exiting, while centralized exchange trading volumes and decentralized lending activity have begun to stabilize after recent spikes. Despite its cautious tone, the report stops short of a fully bearish outlook. Jefferies said longer-term catalysts such as regulatory progress, infrastructure maturity, and greater participation by traditional finance could eventually drive renewed interest in tokens tied to revenue-generating blockchains, leading to wider performance divergence rather than a uniform rebound.45:T214c,The trading industry has become increasingly focused on what is visible to the end user. AI-powered assistants, automated insights, and increasingly sophisticated interfaces now dominate product launches and marketing narratives. Innovation is often judged by the features traders touch, rather than by the systems that determine what actually happens when an order hits the market.
This creates a blind spot. In calm conditions, many platforms look capable. Prices move smoothly, orders are filled without friction, and spreads behave as expected. But calm markets can disguise meaningful differences in how trading platforms are built, supported, and engineered for scale.
When markets stop behaving calmly, those differences stop being theoretical. Surprise data releases, geopolitical developments, and sudden shifts in liquidity place very different demands on technology. Trading engines can look identical on the surface, but their behavior under stress depends on what sits behind them: capacity, execution locations, redundancy, and failover design. In those moments, innovation is experienced less through features and more through pricing coherence and execution quality. 
This is why the industry focus is gradually shifting. The question is no longer which platform looks most advanced. It is which systems remain most predictable when markets accelerate.
Technology that disappears into the experience
In many fields, the most effective technology is often the least visible. When something works perfectly, it fades into the background. The user doesn’t notice the engineering; they notice the absence of friction. In trading, we follow a similar logic.
Some traders may experiment with AI-generated insights or predictive tools. But what matters most in real trading conditions is simpler: execution that behaves consistently, prices that make sense, and systems that remain stable when markets become chaotic. 
This is where technology delivers its greatest value: beneath the surface, in how systems are designed, monitored, and refined over time. At Exness, improvements to pricing behavior, liquidity handling, and execution stability are initiated and shaped by people, engineers, product specialists, and analysts, who understand how markets behave under stress.
Data analytics and automation help teams stress-test behaviour, detect anomalies earlier, and refine execution logic over time. But accountability remains human-led. Someone designs it, someone monitors it, and someone owns the outcome.
Calm markets can hide a weak trading engine
Quiet markets allow fragile systems to operate without drawing attention to their limitations. Under these conditions, many platforms appear competent.
Take a trader entering a silver trade right after a high-impact event. With one broker, spreads widen to reduce broker risk, execution slows as liquidity deteriorates, and the order is filled meaningfully away from the intended level. With another, spreads stay tight, execution remains fast, and sufficient volume is available at the displayed prices to support clean fills. The trade idea may be identical, but the outcome diverges as the platforms behave differently under stress. 
This is what volatility reveals. Spreads may widen unexpectedly, execution can become inconsistent, liquidity may thin, and prices can gap. Orders that are usually executed predictably may deviate from expectations through slippage or delayed execution. 
Traders may interpret these outcomes as failure of discipline or strategy. In practice, the cause can be structural. When a trading platform degrades under pressure, even well-considered decisions can produce distorted results. 
Why trust is the real competitive layer
As trading technology grows more capable, trust becomes both more fragile and complex. Faster systems and increased automation can improve efficiency, but they can also make outcomes harder to interpret.
Many of these improvements are rarely visible. Execution safeguards and stability mechanisms are often understated. Their impact is felt indirectly: fewer disruptions, more predictable costs, and outcomes that better align with intent.
In this environment, trust is formed through experience rather than promises. Traders observe how execution behaves during volatility, how trading costs evolve under stress, and whether platform behaviour remains consistent when conditions change. Over time, predictability becomes a practical advantage.
Performance under stress is not only a technical question but also a commercial one. In volatile moments, brokers and liquidity providers face a choice: maintain competitive conditions and take on more risk, or degrade conditions defensively and reduce it. Traders experience this through spread behaviour and execution quality. The drivers sit deeper: risk posture, liquidity access, and the platform’s ability to handle stress.
Some market participants, like Exness, place more emphasis on how their systems behave under pressure than on surface-level features with limited impact on traders’ experience. This reflects a wider industry discussion: features matter less when they do not translate into better execution, more reliable pricing, or lower friction.
The most valuable uses, including AI, are those that reduce a user’s cognitive and production load. In other words, they strengthen understanding, not substitute judgment. Technology is at its most effective when it simplifies the complex and reinforces autonomy, rather than overriding it. Ultimately, the value of any tool must be measured by its outcome: does it lead to more reliable pricing, lower friction, and a more resilient decision-making process?.
The structural foundations of execution under stress
Designing systems for volatile conditions requires a different architectural focus. 
One priority is the integration of pricing and execution. When quoting and order routing operate as one coherent mechanism, prices are more likely to reflect tradable conditions and execution is more likely to align with what traders expect at entry.
Another is liquidity at scale. Depth becomes most visible when volatility increases and order sizes grow. A platform that can absorb larger trades without amplifying market impact helps preserve pricing integrity under stress.
A third consideration is resilience and monitoring. Reliability is built into the architecture: geographically distributed execution locations to reduce latency, redundant routes to avoid single points of failure, and automated failover so the platform can keep operating even if one component degrades. But architecture alone is not enough. Continuous monitoring is what makes reliability operational, tracking server loads, latency, rejection rates, slippage, and price behaviour so stress is detected early and capacity can be rebalanced before it shows up for traders as wider spreads, delayed fills, or inconsistent pricing.
Finally, there is a structural divide between platforms that are largely outsourced and those engineered in-house. Many brokers rely on ready-made third-party systems: fast to implement, easy to integrate, sufficient in normal conditions. But the trade-off is flexibility to improve. Performance depends on how the external solution handles routing, liquidity access, and volatility.
Brokers with scale often invest in in-house technology to retain control over those key components. It allows them to fine-tune behaviour under volatility and maintain consistent performance when conditions stop being predictable.
Build for the moments that matter
Many visible AI features are designed for stable conditions, where execution quality is treated as given. In calm environments, speed and convenience are a given. But when volatility rises, assumptions break: spreads degrade, liquidity thins, and execution becomes the differentiator.
At that point, real innovation is less about what the interface claims to do and more about whether the platform maintains coherent pricing and predictable fills when the market accelerates.
As the industry integrates increasingly powerful tools, the question becomes less about whether AI is present and more about how it is applied. A trading platform designed with stress in mind does not eliminate uncertainty, but it can change how that uncertainty is experienced. Over time, that distinction will shape how traders evaluate platforms, and how trust is earned.

shift in global commerce. This historic achievement underscores the bloc's growing influence as economic growth accelerates through strategic expansion and deeper trade integration among member states including Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and newer members like UAE, Ethiopia, Iran, and Egypt. The record-breaking trade figures reflect the unique economic complementarity and strategic integration between these nations. The economic dominance within BRICS is led by China, which accounts for approximately 64% of the bloc's overall exports, while India achieved total external trade of US$825.25 billion and Russia's trade with China exceeded US$200 billion for the third consecutive year. BRICS now represents approximately 39.2% of global GDP at purchasing power parity, surpassing G7 nations, with projected economic growth of 3.8% for 2025 - more than triple G7's projected 1.1%.","aiSummaryThai":"การค้าของกลุ่มประเทศ BRICS ทำสถิติสูงสุดเป็นประวัติการณ์ที่ 1 ล้านล้านดอลลาร์สหรัฐในปี 2025 ซึ่งถือเป็นการเปลี่ยนแปลงครั้งใหญ่ในการค้าระดับโลก ความสำเร็จในประวัติศาสตร์นี้เน้นย้ำถึงอิทธิพลที่เพิ่มขึ้นของกลุ่มเมื่อการเติบโตทางเศรษฐกิจเร่งตัวขึ้นผ่านการขยายตัวเชิงกลยุทธ์และการบูรณาการทางการค้าที่ลึกซึ้งขึ้นระหว่างรัฐสมาชิก รวมถึงบราซิล รัสเซีย อินเดีย จีน แอฟริกาใต้ และสมาชิกใหม่อย่าง UAE เอธิโอเปีย อิหร่าน และอียิปต์ ตัวเลขการค้าที่ทำลายสถิติสะท้อนถึงความเสริมซึ่งกันและกันทางเศรษฐกิจที่ไม่ซ้ำใครและการบูรณาการเชิงกลยุทธ์ระหว่างประเทศเหล่านี้ ความเด่นทางเศรษฐกิจภายในกลุ่ม BRICS นำโดยจีนซึ่งคิดเป็นประมาณ 64% ของการส่งออกโดยรวมของกลุ่ม ในขณะที่อินเดียทำการค้าภายนอกรวมที่ 825,250 ล้านดอลลาร์สหรัฐ และการค้าของรัสเซียกับจีนเกิน 200,000 ล้านดอลลาร์สหรัฐเป็นปีที่สามติดต่อกัน BRICS ขณะนี้คิดเป็นประมาณ 39.2% ของ GDP โลกในแง่ความเท่าเทียมของอำนาจซื้อ ซึ่งเหนือกว่ากลุ่ม G7 โดยคาดการณ์การเจริญเติบโตทางเศรษฐกิจที่ 3.8% สำหรับปี 2025 - ซึ่งมากกว่าสามเท่าของ G7 ที่คาดการณ์ไว้ที่ 1.1%","fullContent":"$31","keyPoints":["BRICS trade turnover reached US$1 trillion milestone in 2025","China dominates with 64% of bloc's exports, India achieved US$825.25 billion external trade","BRICS represents 39.2% of global GDP (PPP), surpassing G7 nations","Projected BRICS growth of 3.8% for 2025, more than triple G7's 1.1%","The bloc includes 45% of world's population and controls 40%+ of global oil production"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":674},{"_id":"6985ade938f2116917c64122","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=568045","__v":0,"author":"Ritika Gupta","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"With Bitcoin investors underwater, the bottom debate intensifies.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T09:01:29.090Z","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Ritika-2.webp","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T09:01:29.090Z","link":"https://ambcrypto.com/has-bitcoin-bottomed-why-60k-may-not-be-btcs-floor/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T09:00:52.000Z","sentiment":"bearish","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"นัก","title":"Has Bitcoin bottomed?

XRP dropped 9.77% to trade near $1.30 after failing to hold the $1.50 support level, reaching a low of $1.13. The trading volume spiked from around $4 billion to over $13 billion during the price rebound, suggesting some buying interest near the lows, but upside momentum remains limited due to strong overhead resistance. Technical analysis indicates that while buyers are defending the $1.05-$1.15 support zone, the current rebound appears driven more by short covering than genuine demand. Open interest continues to decline, signaling ongoing deleveraging and lack of conviction among traders.

Bitcoin's implied volatility spiking to 75% (its highest level since the 2024 ETF launch) has triggered this extreme forced selling, particularly as it now exceeds gold volatility. Despite the current downturn, Park maintains a bullish medium-term outlook, viewing this as a necessary process to clear out leverage and weak hands before a 'fast melt-up' occurs.","aiSummaryThai":"เจฟ พาร์ก ที่ปรึกษาจาก Bitwise อธิบายว่าการที่ Bitcoin และตลาดคริปโตฯ ร่วงลงอย่างหนักล่าสุดเป็นผลมาจากการบริหารความเสี่ยงของสถาบัน โดยเฉพาะเฮดจ์ฟันด์ที่ใช้กลยุทธ์หลายรูปแบบซึ่งกำลังขายในวงกว้างเพื่อให้สอดคล้องกับแบบจำลองความเสี่ยงภายใน ประมาณหนึ่งในสามของหุ้น Bitcoin ETF ถูกถือโดยนักลงทุนสถาบัน ซึ่งเฮดจ์ฟันด์ถือครองอยู่ประมาณครึ่งหนึ่ง และเงินทุนเหล่านี้เป็น 'fast money' ที่ลงทุนในการเทรดแบบ delta-hedged หรือ relative value มากกว่าการลงทุนระยะยาว ความผันผวนโดยนัยของ Bitcoin ที่พุ่งสูงถึง 75% (สูงสุดนับตั้งแต่การเปิดตัว ETF ในปี 2024) ได้กลายเป็นตัวเร่งสำคัญของการขายแบบบังคับ แม้จะมีสภาพตลาดที่ตกต่ำแต่พาร์กยังคงมองโลกในแง่ดีระยะกลางถึงยาว โดยมองว่าสถานการณ์ปัจจุบันเป็นกระบวนการที่จำเป็นเพื่อกำจัดเลเวอเรจและนักลงทุนที่อ่อนแอก่อนที่จะเกิด 'fast melt-up' ขึ้น","fullContent":"$42","keyPoints":["Institutional risk management and hedge funds caused the crypto crash","Bitcoin ETF institutional ownership is roughly one-third, with hedge funds comprising half","Bitcoin's implied volatility reached 75%, triggering forced selling","Bitcoin volatility now exceeds gold volatility for the first time","Park remains bullish medium-term, expecting a 'fast melt-up' after leverage clears"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":429},{"_id":"6985990e38f2116917c1647d","guid":"d10ea856-adb2-49b9-b44d-9f16012f85b8","__v":0,"author":"Sam Reynolds","categories":["regulation"],"category":"regulation","content":"Bank says institutional de-risking continues, but resilient network activity and growing TradFi adoption could lift revenue-linked assets over time","createdAt":"2026-02-06T07:32:30.311Z","enclosure":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c11c9abe9010ceaa61014a311262a6d680871b7d-1920x1080.jpg?fm=jpg&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T07:32:30.312Z","link":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/jefferies-sees-few-signs-of-a-crypto-bottom-yet-flags-upside-for-tokens-with-fundamentals","pubDate":"2026-02-06T07:30:59.000Z","sentiment":"neutral","source":"CoinDesk","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"Jefferies มองว่าตลาดคริปโตยังไม่ถึงจุดต่ำสุด แต่มองโ","title":"Jefferies sees few signs of a crypto bottom yet flags upside for tokens with fundamentals","translatedContent":"ธนาคารกล่าวว่าสถาบันการเงินยังคงดำเนินการลดความเสี่ยงต่อไป แต่กิจกรรมเครือข่ายที่ยังคงมีความยืดหยุ่นและการนำ TradFi มาใช้ที่เพิ่มขึ้นอาจช่วยผลักดันสินทรัพย์ที่เชื่อมโยงกับรายได้ให้เพิ่มขึ้นในระยะยาว","translatedTitle":"Jefferies มองว่ายังมีสัญญาณน้อยที่ราคาคริปโตจะถึงจุดต่ำสุด แต่เน้นว่าโทเคนที่มีพื้นฐานทางการเงินที่ดีมีโอกาสขาขึ้น","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:36:40.104Z","aiSummary":"Jefferies reports that despite Bitcoin and Ethereum trading near historically attractive levels, the crypto market shows few signs of an imminent bottom. The bank characterizes the current downturn as a liquidity-driven correction rather than a fundamental collapse, noting that blockchain network activity remains resilient. Bitcoin trades near $64,800 (47% below its October 2025 peak), while Ether hovers around $1,900 (down nearly 60% from cycle highs).\n\nThe bank attributes the weakness to broader risk-off sentiment in global markets and rotation away from growth assets, with $2 billion in long liquidations amplifying volatility. Near-term headwinds include selling from large Bitcoin holders and spot ETF net outflows. However, Jefferies notes that smaller and mid-sized holders are maintaining positions, and trading volumes have stabilized. The bank maintains a cautiously optimistic long-term view, suggesting regulatory progress and traditional finance adoption could benefit tokens with strong fundamentals.","aiSummaryThai":"$43","fullContent":"$44","keyPoints":["Current crypto downturn is liquidity-driven rather than fundamental collapse","Bitcoin down 47% from October 2025 peak, Ether down nearly 60% from cycle highs","Jefferies notes resilient network activity and stabilization in trading volumes","Long-term catalysts may benefit tokens tied to revenue-generating blockchains"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":303},{"_id":"6985991038f2116917c16809","guid":"https://news.bitcoin.com/?p=790142&preview=true&preview_id=790142","__v":0,"author":"Bitcoin.com","categories":["ethereum"],"category":"ethereum","content":"Stablecoin issuer Tether acquires 12% of Gold.com, aiming to bridge digital currencies with physical gold markets amid record gold prices and growing tokenization trends.
