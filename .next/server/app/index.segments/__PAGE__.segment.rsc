Long-term forecasts suggest ONDO could reach $9.30 by 2030. ONDO Finance in the RWA sector is a hot topic, investors are closely eyeing its future potential. Especially as its native token ONDO continues to build credibility and momentum through high-profile developments. Moreover, Ondo Finance is known to be a leading RWA provider on the Solana chain and it is witnessing growing institutional interest, ONDO has solidified itself as a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) space. With such attraction, the ONDO price prediction 2026 is what analysts and retail investors are intrigued about. But how far can it go from here? Let’s dive into the detailed ONDO price forecast from 2025 to 2030. Ondo Price Today Cryptocurrency Ondo Token ONDO Price $0.2591 11.11% Market Cap $ 1,261,834,661.46 24h Volume $ 125,026,349.7744 Circulating Supply 4,869,330,647.00 Total Supply 10,000,000,000.00 All-Time High $ 2.1413 on 16 December 2024 All-Time Low $ 0.0835 on 18 January 2024 Coinpedia’s ONDO Price Prediction 2026 ONDO/USD has been declining since early 2025, reaching a support level around $0.20 in February 2026. A potential reversal may occur if it breaks the $0.60 resistance. Key targets for Q1 2026 are $0.80 and $1.20. On the daily chart, the ONDO price fall continued in January and February, and also began on a bearish note. It is now retesting the lower border of the falling wedge pattern. This support is the level where buying could be happening, and once it overflows with demand, a rise could burst its way out. Also, the falling wedge range is narrowing, and ONDO/USD is at a key support level. February could see a revisit to the $0.50-$0.60 range. If it breaks above this level, it may aim for $0.80, which could be a significant target for February. However, if it fails to do so, the price may continue to consolidate around the support level or potentially decline further. ONDO Price Prediction 2026 The weekly chart for ONDO/USD shows a declining trend since the start of 2025, following a high of $2.14. The descending trendline acted as a strong hurdle, characterized by lower highs and lower lows in price action, indicating reduced price volatility. The persistent bearish pressure on the weekly chart signals bear dominance. The same price fall continued in Q1 2026, and January and early February have taken a severe hit, but it has reached February 2024 based support around $0.20 in early February 2026, which indicates that a reversal may be possible before Q1 completes in March 2026. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2026, the market may be ready for a rally, especially if it breaks through the $0.60 resistance. The recent establishment of $0.20 as a support level, along with increased demand for ONDO, suggests that buyers may be willing to re-enter the market at this price. If the market surpasses the $0.60 resistance following $0.50, the next big targets for ONDO/USD would be $ 0.80 and $1.20 for Q1 2026. ONDO Price Analysis: Onchain Outlook The on-chain data indicate that although the price is currently capped and has been consolidating for several months, the on-chain metrics have strengthened significantly despite the weak ONDO price action. Since January 2024, the number of confirmed transactions sent to a project’s contracts has increased. By December 2025, the project had surpassed 1.3 million transactions, making it the second-largest project for real-world asset (RWA) issuance after BitGo. Additionally, the “Spot Average Order Size” maintains high levels (represented by green dots) while the price is declining; it is a classic signal of Whale Absorption. Therefore, this Consistent whale activity confirms institutional conviction in the RWA (Real World Asset) sector.

But does its innovative model signal long-term growth for HYPE Token Price? In this article, we dive deep into market sentiment and Hyperliquid price projections from 2026 to 2030. Cryptocurrency Hyperliquid Token HYPE Price $32.9094 -6.01% Market Cap $ 8,553,026,409.43 24h Volume $ 822,158,565.6238 Circulating Supply 259,896,091.9480 Total Supply 958,758,700.4373 All-Time High $ 59.3926 on 18 September 2025 All-Time Low $ 3.2003 on 29 November 2024 Coinpedia’s HYPE Price Prediction 2026 In January 2026, the price rallied 70% from $20 to $35, signaling strong bullish sentiment. The breakout from a falling wedge pattern, starting from a demand zone around $22-$24, signals a rally in Q1 2026. If the market clears consolidation near $33, we could see prices rise toward $42 soon. Hyperliquid Price Prediction 2026 After closing 2025 around $24, January 2026 kicked off with a stunning rally in the final week, soaring 70% from $20 to $35. This surge unmistakably shows that bulls are aggressively buying, determined to drive HYPE prices back up. The Q4 2025 chart has clearly formed a falling wedge pattern, and with this recent movement, a breakout has been achieved. The January rally originates directly from its lower boundary, perfectly aligning with a robust horizontal demand zone around $22-$24. This optimal setup strongly signals a powerful rally that is set to unfold in Q1 2026. We have already witnessed a breakout from the pattern, and the retest phase that began in early February on the upper border confirms our expectations. Once the market breaks through the current consolidation around $33, a significant rally toward the $42 mark is inevitable. This crucial breakout will undoubtedly attract even more buying interest, reinforcing the bullish sentiment and setting the stage for substantial gains ahead.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.45-$1.05 in 2026. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the cryptocurrency space, with a fast and secure blockchain that offers a distinct approach to transaction processing compared to Ethereum and other smart contract chains. It’s permission-only, meaning the blockchain is managed by private companies. Limiting what types of decentralised applications are allowed is what makes Hedera stand out from the rest. Having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, it is now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. Hedera has also recently ramped up its development activities for its ecosystem. Its ecosystem is strengthening, despite its capped price action. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price chart 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and discussions about SEC approved HBAR ETF would flood string liquidity. Many are intrigued that: Will the HBAR Price Reach $1? Let’s discuss this in our Hedera price prediction 2025 article. Hedera Price Today Cryptocurrency Hedera Token HBAR Price $0.0906 11.30% Market Cap $ 3,894,157,866.08 24h Volume $ 307,534,576.0111 Circulating Supply 43,003,138,665.2407 Total Supply 50,000,000,000.00 All-Time High $ 0.5701 on 16 September 2021 All-Time Low $ 0.0100 on 02 January 2020 Coinpedia’s HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR’s price fell to $0.105 by January 2026, despite having an ETF and direct access to institutional flows, due to low demand. If support holds at $0.075 to $0.080, a recovery rally may emerge in Q1 2026. However, falling below this level could raise investor concerns, while a price increase could encounter resistance at $0.1930, with further potential at $0.2835 and $0.4010. HBAR Price Prediction 2026: What’s Next for Hedera? The HBAR price has experienced a prolonged period of consolidation below $0.120, lasting nearly 2 years from 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. Then a rally in Q4 2024 pushed it to $0.4010. But by the end of 2025, it is back below $0.120, and by the end of January 2026, it has slipped to $0.105. Despite an ETF, the price is witnessing lower demand and consolidating at the lower border of a falling wedge. This setup looks promising if $0.100-$0.105 holds its support, which closely aligns with the pattern’s lower border. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2026, there’s optimism based on this pattern. Currently, a strong range-bound price action is witnessed. A successful recovery rally from this point would indicate robust demand and could signal a stronger upward move. On the other hand, entering below this price zone could also raise concerns among investors, as market fluctuations and investor sentiment may lead to uncertainty. But, if it really spikes, then $0.1930 is key resistance in the immediate term and beyond this, 2026 could revisit $0.2835, followed by $0.4010 high. HBAR On-Chain & ETF analysis The HBAR ETF is gaining momentum once again, with $1.46 million in inflows this week. The last time we saw such significant inflows was in early December, when it reached $1.78 million. This suggests liquidity is flowing into HBAR, potentially signaling a price rise. Also, large orders from whales have been increasing since mid-October, suggesting that they are purchasing HBAR on every price decline.

It has been just under a year since the controversial project’s native token began trading on several exchanges. The journey so far has been quite underwhelming for investors, who saw the PI token rocket to an all-time high of $2.99 in late February 2025 and then experienced what can only be described as a massive cataclysmic nosedive. PI dumped by more than 95% in less than a year. The past few weeks have been particularly painful as the token crashed to consecutive all-time lows, with the latest being at $0.1338 (on CoinGecko) after a 40% decline in a month. Although it has recovered slightly to nearly $0.145, overall sentiment has taken its toll, and the question is whether PI will drop even further. New ATLs Ahead? To gain a different perspective on the matter, we asked ChatGPT and Gemini. OpenAI’s alternative explained that PI’s inability to respond positively to recent network updates, which we have repeatedly highlighted , is a clear sign that its market structure and supply dynamics are dominating overall sentiment. The steady decline to new lows suggests that the selling pressure remains persistent, the speculative demand is weak, and there’s insignificant external capital entering the market. “Unlike more established altcoins, PI lacks deep liquidity buffers. When selling accelerates, price discovery to the downside can happen fast – as the recent crash demonstrated,” ChatGPT added. It outlined a few scenarios ahead for PI, with the extreme bear-case predicting a massive plunge to $0.06-$0.08. This “true capitulation phase” would be possible if the token unlock pressure continues , liquidity remains thin, and the broader market sentiment deteriorates even further. However, ChatGPT reiterated that this is an extreme scenario. Instead, it envisions a more likely decline to $0.10 before the token can bottom out and find more solid support. Or Even Worse… Gemini said the daily chart for PI paints a clear “stairway to hell” picture ever since it broke down beneath $0.20. Interestingly, it was even more bearish on PI’s future price performance since the token is now in “no man’s land” below $0.15.

There’s another, even worse path ahead, which Gemini called “the zombie chain scenario.” In it, PI would dump below $0.05 and will effectively become a “zombie coin” – high holder count, zero trading volume, and interest. However, the current odds for such a mindblowing crash are below 20%, Gemini explained, as it would require full investor capitulation, sell-offs by the Core Team, and overall market collapse.

The company has also opened financing channels to help fund buys, including a stock offering that was announced to support staged purchases rather than a single big trade. おはプラネット。最近の株価動向を踏まえ、株主の皆さまにとって厳しい状況が続いていることは、私たちも十分に認識しています。しかしながら、メタプラネットの戦略に変更はありません。私たちは引き続き、ビットコインの積み上げ、収益の拡大、そして次の成長フェーズに向けた準備を、着実に進めてい… — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) February 6, 2026 Market Gloom And Heavy Paper Losses Reports note that the recent slump in Bitcoin prices has hammered firms that use the coin as their main reserve asset. Metaplanet’s share price has slid, mirroring a wider selloff in corporate Bitcoin treasuries, and investor mood has turned cautious as unrealized impairments mount. The wider market wobble has pushed some treasury companies to report deep impairments and to rethink near-term funding moves. CEO Reaffirms Buying Plan Reports say Metaplanet’s chief executive has publicly stated there is no change to the buying policy and that the firm will steadily keep adding BTC. The message was posted on social channels and translated for local media, where the CEO stressed that accumulation will continue alongside efforts to expand revenue sources. That comment came amid heavy volatility and concerns about how long the downturn might last. BTCUSD currently trading at $69,610. Chart: TradingView Bitcoin Price Action In The Middle Of The Story Bitcoin itself has been volatile this week. The token traded below recent highs before recovering some ground, and the quick moves have amplified unrealized gains and losses across corporate balance sheets. The market has swung hard, creating days when billions of dollars were wiped from prices and other days when a modest rebound pushed values back up. Impairment And Funding Moves Based on reports, Metaplanet recorded a substantial non-cash impairment tied to its Bitcoin holdings, a figure roughly in the hundreds of millions of dollars that trimmed reported earnings for the year. At the same time, management has put in place capital-raising steps — including equity issuance — aimed at giving the company the firepower to buy in stages and support operations while prices remain rocky.

Mature companies are winning more investment now, DefiLlama data shows. Top investors include Goldman Sachs, Citi, and Galaxy Digital. The $2 trillion crypto market wipeout isn’t stopping venture capitalists from shopping for deals. Investors poured in another $258 million into crypto companies in the first week of February, according to DefiLlama data . Popular sectors included decentralised finance with four deals, and payments with three. “VCs are starting to steer their resources towards later stage projects, particularly those with institutional partnerships in place and clear go-to-market strategies,” Charles Chong, vice-president of strategy at crypto advisory firm BlockSpaceForce, told DL News . “They’re trying to spot the most promising late-stage project before it achieves mainstream success.” Here are the top three raises this week. Anchorage Digital, $100 million Anchorage Digital, the first US federally chartered crypto bank, secured $100 million in strategic funding led by USDT stablecoin issuer Tether. The firm provides institutional clients with an integrated suite of services spanning secure custody, trading and crypto-native banking, and positions itself as a one-stop shop for compliant digital asset finance. The investment is aimed at scaling Anchorage’s infrastructure as demand from asset managers, financial institutions and corporates continues to rise. “The investment reinforces a broader strategy centred on regulatory alignment and long-term partnerships with institutions that are helping define how stablecoins operate within established financial and legal frameworks,” Tether said. TRM Labs, $70 million Blockchain intelligence platform TRM Labs raised $70 million in a Series C round led by Blockchain Capital. The firm is valued at $1 billion. The round included top investors, including Goldman Sachs, Bessemer Venture Partners, DRW Venture Capital, Y Combinator, Thoma Bravo, Alumni Ventures, Citi Ventures, Brevan Howard Digital, and Galaxy Ventures. The company supplies analytics software used by financial institutions, crypto firms and government agencies to trace transactions, investigate illicit activity and prevent fraud across digital asset networks. Fresh capital will be deployed to expand TRM’s investigative capabilities and international footprint, reflecting how closely crypto adoption is now tied to law enforcement cooperation, sanctions monitoring and financial crime prevention. Jupiter, $35 million Jupiter, a decentralised exchange aggregator on Solana, completed a $35 million strategic funding round from ParaFi Capital. The deal was settled in JupUSD, Jupiter’s stablecoin, with ParaFi buying JUP tokens at spot price and committing to an extended token lockup, the protocol said. On Sunday, Jupiter said on X that prediction market Polymarket will come to Solana through its platform.

Large holders accumulate 230 million XRP, reducing sell side pressure across markets. Price targets $1.70 if resistance near $1.47 breaks with bullish momentum building. XRP has staged a sharp rebound after a steep sell-off rattled investor confidence across the market. The token had suffered heavy losses, triggering fear-driven exits among retail holders. However, select investor cohorts viewed the decline as an opportunity. Their strategic accumulation has already begun shifting momentum in XRP’s favor. Sponsored Sponsored XRP Holders Exhibit Substantial Support XRP whales have taken an active role in driving the recent recovery. Over the past 48 hours, wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP accumulated more than 230 million tokens. At current prices, this buying spree exceeds $335 million, signaling strong conviction among large holders. This accumulation coincided with Friday’s rebound, highlighting whales’ influence on price direction. Large-scale buying reduces circulating supply and absorbs sell-side pressure. Such behavior often acts as a catalyst during corrective phases, helping stabilize price and restore confidence when broader sentiment remains fragile. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . XRP Whale Holding. Source: Santiment Network activity also supports the recovery narrative. New XRP address creation surged alongside whale accumulation. Over the same 48-hour period, first-time transacting addresses increased by 51.5%, reaching 5,182. This marks the highest level of new participation in roughly two and a half months. Sponsored Sponsored An influx of new investors strengthens rallies by injecting fresh capital rather than recycling existing liquidity. Rising participation suggests growing interest beyond short-term speculation. With new addresses expanding and whale support present, XRP’s recovery attempt gains structural backing at the macro level. XRP New Addresses. Source: Glassnode What Is XRP Price’s Next Target? XRP is trading near $1.46 at the time of writing, hovering just below the $1.47 resistance. The altcoin rebounded 20.5% after a severe downturn that erased 36% of its value in a few days. This bounce reflects improving demand conditions following capitulation. Whale accumulation and rising network activity increase the probability of further upside. A push toward $1.70 appears achievable in the near term. This level represents a key psychological barrier. A successful break would likely attract additional inflows and strengthen the recovery structure. XRP Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risk remains if resistance holds. Failure to clear $1.58 could invite renewed selling pressure. Under that scenario, XRP may fall below $1.37 and slide toward $1.28. Such a move would invalidate the bullish thesis and erase a significant portion of the recent rebound.

Ad Disclosure Ethereum’s (ETH) latest downturn below $2,000 is no longer confined to price charts alone. Capital flows, on-chain data, and technical structure are now aligning with the bearish momentum, supporting concerns that the selloff may have further room to run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price May Slide Toward $50,000 By March-April, Top Analyst Warns As ETH breaks below key support zones, fresh ETF outflows and shifting investor behavior are adding pressure at a time when confidence already looks fragile. ETH's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview ETF Outflows Signal Waning Institutional Appetite Ethereum spot ETFs recorded a net outflow of $80.79 million on February 5, according to SoSoValue data . Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the bulk of the move, with $55.78 million leaving the fund in a single session. While FETH still holds a cumulative historical inflow of $2.51 billion, the sharp daily withdrawal highlights renewed caution among investors. Not all products saw exits. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) posted the largest daily inflow at $7.05 million, followed by Invesco’s QETH with $3.53 million. However, these gains were not enough to offset broader selling. Total Ethereum spot ETF assets now stand at $10.9 billion, representing about 4.83% of ETH’s market capitalization. The uneven flow picture suggests selective positioning rather than broad-based accumulation. Ethereum Price Structure Weakens as Support Levels Give Way Ethereum’s price action has continued to trend lower, with ETH recently trading below the $2,000 range after briefly dipping to $1,750 earlier this week. Analysts tracking higher time frames note that the bearish market structure remains intact, with no confirmed bullish shift on the four-hour chart. Former support around $2,125 has now turned into resistance, while traders are watching liquidity zones near $2,200 and $2,300 for potential reactions. A sustained reclaim above $2,345 is widely viewed as the minimum requirement to signal a trend change. Until then, rallies are being treated as corrective moves within a broader downtrend. On-Chain Signals and Developer Concerns Add Context On-chain data shows a clear divergence between investor cohorts. Mid-sized holders have reduced exposure during the decline, while large wallets have increased their holdings, suggesting accumulation by long-term players amid weakness. At the same time, exchange inflows, particularly on Binance, have risen to levels last seen in 2022, often associated with distribution or repositioning. Beyond price, Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently criticized the lack of innovation among copycat EVM chains, arguing that scaling progress risks stagnation without deeper technical differentiation. While these comments are not directly market-related, they support broader concerns about direction and execution within the ecosystem.

Even the large-cap memes have faced the impact of the overnight liquidations that saw Bitcoin [BTC] lose more than $10K in its valuation. Fartcoin [FARTCOIN], one among the top-capped memecoins, plunged by about 15% in the past 24 hours. The decline was clearly reflected in both its price charts and trading activity at press time. Why is FARTCOIN price crashing? FARTCOIN ‘s price was declining for a couple of reasons. While the memecoin commanded the highest volume on the Pump.fun [PUMP] ecosystem, it was on the bad side. As per the data , a big chunk of the $16.8 million of the volume traded was on the sell side. This conclusion is due to additional data indicating that FARTCOIN was the most sold token by the smart money traders. As per Stalkchain, about $100K in capital from these traders exited the cap of the memecoin, outpacing other Solana-based memecoins. Moreover, the number of long liquidations was increasing, accelerating the sell pressure. In the past 24 hours, traders liquidated about $2.3 million in longs, which is equivalent to more than 10x the size of shorts. This brought the total to more than $5 million in two days. Lookonchain data showed another liquidation in Dogecoin [DOGE] and dogwifhat [WIF] , indicating the widespread memecoin market weakness. Source: CoinGlass That was not all, as Open Interest (OI) across the top 10 exchanges was declining too. The data from CoinGlass showed that OI had dropped on average by double digits as of writing, with some scenarios exceeding 25%. Source: CoinGlass Only Bitget dropped by a small figure, 1.42%, in this category. The list also included DEXs, indicating a synchronized global loss of interest in the memecoin. Whales add more weight to the price decline! The numerical representation of the memecoin on the charts drew a clearer picture. FARTCOIN was trading in a descending trend channel, which was supported by a Volume Channel Flow indicator. FARTCOIN’s price has been forming lower structural points. Large holders (whales) have intensified the decline by selling roughly $64.87 million, a capital outflow similar to that seen on the 31st of January. At the time of writing, the price appeared to be rebounding toward the channel’s upper resistance, suggesting a potential short‑term retracement to the upside. However, this does not rule out the risk of a breakdown below the lower support level. Source: FARTCOIN/USDT on TradingView With that in mind, the memecoin was aping, to a larger extent, what the market was doing. During downturns, memecoins bear the brunt of the pressure. Final Thoughts FARTCOIN crashes 15% from massive liquidations and intense selling pressure. Whales are contributing to the price crash, but FARTCOIN may be poised for a pause in bearishness.e:T43d,Bitcoin's next major catalyst might not come from accommodative policies like lower interest rates as commonly believed, according to ProCap Financial's Jeff Park. He suggests the 'endgame' for Bitcoin could be a scenario where its price rises alongside increasing interest rates, a concept he calls 'positive row Bitcoin.' This would be counterintuitive to traditional economic theory but would represent Bitcoin achieving its ideal role as a store of value. Park believes this scenario would undermine the current 'risk-free rate' and reflects a 'broken' monetary system.

The analyst spoke on The Pomp Podcast, emphasizing that such a development would challenge conventional wisdom that accommodative policies (like quantitative easing) are always bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $70,503, down 22.53% over the past month, while market predictions suggest traders are betting on future Fed interest rate cuts. Park's perspective highlights the potential evolution of Bitcoin's relationship with traditional monetary policy in the coming years.f:Tb50,Bitcoin’s next major catalyst may come from the common assumption being flipped on its head that interest rates are bullish for Bitcoin only when they fall, according to a crypto analyst. “I think we should expect that having more accommodative policies may in fact actually not be the catalyst to help us go into a bull market,” ProCap Financial chief investment officer Jeff Park said during an interview with Anthony Pompliano on Thursday. “We have to accept that reality and possibility,” Park said. Accomodative policies, such as lowering interest rates, are employed by the US Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth, reduce unemployment, and increase liquidity. Bitcoiners often see these conditions as more favorable for riskier assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), as traditional investments like bonds and term deposits become less attractive. Jeff Park spoke to Anthony Pompliano on The Pomp Podcast. Source: Anthony Pompliano Rising interest rates are usually seen as a negative for Bitcoin, but Park said that may not be the case forever. He said Bitcoin’s next biggest upside catalyst — and potentially its “endgame” — may be its entry into what he called a “positive row Bitcoin,” where the asset’s price continues to rise even as US Federal Reserve interest rates rise. “Perfect holy grail” for Bitcoin “This is the mythical, elusive perfect holy grail of what Bitcoin is meant to be, which is when Bitcoin goes up as interest rates go up, which is very counterintuitive to the QE theory,” he said. However, Park said this idea would undermine the “risk-free rate itself.” Park emphasizes the monetary system “is broken” “In that world, what we’re saying is actually because the risk-free rate is not the risk-free rate, because the dollar hegemony is not the dollar hegemony, and we are no longer able to price the yield curve in the ways we’ve known,” Park said. Related: Bitcoin price rebounds 11% above $65K: Who is buying the dip? Park explained that the monetary system is “broken” and the relationship between the Fed and the US Treasury is “not at the level it should be” to drive the direction of national securities. Traders on the crypto prediction platform Polymarket are giving the highest probability, 27%, to three total Fed interest rate cuts in 2026. Bitcoin is trading at $70,503 at the time of publication, down 22.53% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap.

Ad Disclosure Reports show a big reshuffle in Bitcoin holdings as price swings spooked some big wallets and invited smaller players back into the market. According to Santiment , wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC — the so-called “whale and shark” cohort — have trimmed their share of the total supply to a nine-month low, now around 68% after a recent wave of selling. This pullback included roughly -81,068 BTC moved out of those buckets in about eight days. Whales Cut Stakes, Retail Steps In Retail buyers have been the active counterparty. Reports note that “shrimp” wallets — those holding less than 0.1 BTC — climbed to their highest share since mid-2024, now accounting for roughly 0.24% of supply. The pattern is familiar: large holders pare exposure, smaller accounts pick up coins on dips. The result is sharper swings in price as the market rebalances. Market Moves And What They Mean Price action pushed the story into view. Bitcoin slid from higher levels into the low $60,000s, briefly testing roughly $59,000 before a rebound pushed it back toward the mid-$60ks. The sell-off coincided with troubles in broader risk markets, and traders reacted fast. Some of that selling pressure showed up in ETF flows and futures, while on-chain transfers hinted that big holders were reducing positions while retail piled in. 🧐 What’s been behind the Bitcoin crash that has seen prices fall to as low as $60,001 for the first time since October, 2024? 🐳 Whale and shark wallets holding 10-10K Bitcoin now hold a 9-month low 68.04% of the entire $BTC supply. This includes a dump of -81,068 BTC in just… pic.twitter.com/Yyd20dy3nS — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 6, 2026 The sell-off looks tied to both risk appetite and timing. One widely shared post on social media from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju called attention to the mood among analysts, saying that practically all Bitcoin analysts were sounding bearish at the moment. That kind of consensus can push traders toward taking quicker losses or closing positions. Sentiment Falls To Levels Last Seen In 2022 The broader mood has hardened. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunged to 9 this week, a reading that sits inside “extreme fear” territory and has not been seen since the turmoil around mid-2022. Lower sentiment often tightens liquidity and magnifies price moves. When fear is high, even small catalysts can lead to outsized reactions. BTCUSD now trading at $66,247. Chart: TradingView Why This Could Matter When large holders cut back while many small accounts buy, the market structure changes. Liquidity can become thinner at certain price bands, so dips are deeper and rallies can be swift when buying returns. History shows that these phases sometimes lead to extended consolidation periods. Other times they mark the start of a larger trend reversal. Right now, both are possible; clarity will arrive only after flows and macro signals settle. A Note On The Backdrop Some traders point to geopolitics and macro headlines as the trigger for the latest nervousness. Reports say global risk-off moves — including weak tech stocks and trade tensions — fed into crypto selling. Still, Bitcoin remains well above many long-term supports that traders watch. Many long-term holders have been steady buyers through past pullbacks. That steady buying could matter if fear eases and larger investors begin to redeploy capital.

For instance, U.S President Donald Trump’s 2024 win, after openly endorsing crypto, highlighted just how much these two worlds can influence each other. Given this context, it’s no wonder that the FUD around Kevin Warsh’s nomination as the next Fed Chair has started spilling into Bitcoin [BTC]. Especially as investors try to assess the long-term implications of this decision. However, with Bitcoin down 14% over the past week since the nomination, it’s clear that the market isn’t pricing in a bull run just yet. More importantly, U.S assets across the board are also moving down together. Source: Bloomberg Why does this matter? Well, it shows that BTC’s decline isn’t driven by crypto-specific factors. Instead, investors who had been betting on reflation have turned cautious , worried that Warsh’s policies could tighten liquidity. For context, reflation is when the economy is stimulated to boost growth after a slow period. This usually means more Fed liquidity and lower interest rates, conditions that have historically helped Bitcoin move higher. However, Kevin Warsh, while bullish on rate cuts, wants the Fed to shrink its balance sheet. As a result, investors are weighing the long-term impact, raising the question – Is BTC’s pullback signaling something bigger? Fed pick boosts rate bets, Bitcoin stays sideways No doubt, President Trump gave a big boost to his rate-cut narrative. For context, the main reason he picked Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair is to have someone more bullish on rate cuts. Unlike current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose policy stance often went against Trump’s view. And yet, Bitcoin isn’t rallying. In fact, even during the 2025 cycle, when the Fed cut rates three times , BTC still ended the year down 6.3%. In short, the impact of Kevin Warsh’s nomination still can’t be fully priced in. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) At the same time, the liquidity-squeeze story is already weighing on investor sentiment, with bearish pressure on Bitcoin starting to show. If Kevin Warsh steps into the role, it could have major effects on markets. On top of that, inflation has been stubborn, recent macro releases have come in higher than expected, and President Trump’s back-and-forth on tariffs keeps uncertainty high. Even rate cuts can’t be fully priced in. Hence, for Bitcoin, even though the market has priced in Trump picking Kevin Warsh as Fed Chair, the impact on BTC remains unclear. Hence, judging by the current setup, the market may be more bearish than bullish. Final Thoughts Kevin Warsh’s nomination as Fed Chair has reinforced expectations of rate cuts, yet Bitcoin is down 14.3% over the past week. Investors are factoring in Warsh’s plan to shrink the Fed’s balance sheet, stubborn inflation, and Trump’s back-and-forth on tariffs.

With over 700 billion tokens recorded in exchange-related flows over the last day, Shiba Inu has recently seen a significant increase in on-chain activity. Although price action is still erratic, following weeks of drops in the overall cryptocurrency market, underlying indicators point to the potential slowdown of the aggressive selling phase. Shiba Inu exodus yet to come Exchange outflows have significantly increased in comparison to inflows, according to recent data. To put it simply, there are more SHIB exiting exchanges than entering. Usually, this activity shows that investors are transferring tokens into personal wallets instead of getting them ready for sale. When market participants opt for accumulation or long-term holding rather than panic-selling, such movements frequently occur close to local bottoms. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView SHIB avoided some of the catastrophic breakdowns observed on larger assets during the recent downturn, but it did follow the overall market decline. While there were significant liquidation cascades for Bitcoin and Ethereum, SHIB's decline was relatively contained despite being severe. HOT Stories Data on exchange flows now suggests that sellers are running out of energy. Large exchange outflows typically indicate that selling pressure has slowed. The immediate supply of tokens that can be dumped decreases as fewer tokens are left on trading platforms. If demand starts to rebound along with improved market sentiment, it becomes possible for prices to stabilize or even recover temporarily. You Might Also Like Rekindled interest from funds and bigger investors hoping to get in front of a possible market recovery is another element. After forced selling stops, cryptocurrency markets frequently pick up speed, and early capital often shifts to riskier assets like SHIB in pursuit of disproportionate returns . Nonetheless, the combination of robust outflows, waning sell pressure and fresh accumulation signals raises the possibility that the current price zones will see a normalization of conditions.13:T1670,BlackRock bitcoin ETF options errupt in crash: Hedge fund blowup or just market madness? Options trading on BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, IBIT, surged to a record 2.33 million contracts on Thursday as bitcoin crashed. Feb 7, 2026, 2:25 a.m. BlackRock's spot bitcoin BTC $70,432.24 exchange-traded fund has been a massive hit since launch, pulling in billions from investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency without the hassle of crypto wallets or exchanges. Traders and analysts religiously track inflows into the fund to gauge how institutions are positioning in the market. Now they might have to do the same with options tied to the ETF, as activity exploded during Thursday's crash. According to one observer, the record activity stemmed from a hedge fund blowup, while others disagreed, citing routine market chaos as a catalyst. STORY CONTINUES BELOW What really stood out On Friday, as the ETF tanked 13% to its lowest level since October 2024, options volume exploded to a record 2.33 million contracts, with puts narrowly outpacing calls. The fact that puts saw more volume than calls on Thursday indicates a higher demand for downside protection, a typical occurrence during price sell-offs. Options are derivative contracts that provide built-in insurance against swings in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, IBIT. You pay a small fee (premium) for the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell IBIT at a set price by a deadline or expiry. A call option lets you lock in IBIT at a set price today for a small premium. If it rallies above that level later, you buy cheap and sell for profit; if not, you only lose the premium. A put option locks in the sale of IBIT at that price. If it slides below, you sell high and pocket the difference; otherwise, you lose just the premium. Calls offer leveraged upside bets, while puts protect against downside drops. Another standout figure was the record $900 million in premiums paid by IBIT options buyers that day—the highest single-day total ever. To put it in context, that's equivalent to the market cap of several crypto tokens ranking beyond the top 70. Speculative theory: record activity tied to hedge fund blowup A post by market analyst Parker , which has gone viral on X, argues that the $900 million premium payments resulted from the blowup of a large hedge fund (one or a few) with nearly 100% of money invested in IBIT. Funds often focus on just one asset, avoiding spreading out risk exposure elsewhere. Parker's post alleges that this fund initially bought cheap "out of the money" call options on IBIT following the October crash, anticipating a quick recovery and bigger rally. These OTM calls are like cheap lottery tickets at levels well above the ongoing price of the underlying asset. If the asset rallies past these levels, these calls make significant money; if it doesn't, buyers of these calls lose the initial premium paid. However, the fund bought these calls using borrowed money. As IBIT continued to drop, they doubled down on their bet. On Thursday, as IBIT crashed, these calls tanked in value and brokers hit the fund with margin calls demanding cash/collateral. The fund, having bled money elsewhere, was unable to provide the same and ended up dumping large amounts of IBIT shares in the market, resulting in a record $10 billion spot volume . The fund also desperately replaced expiring calls or closed loss-making calls, resulting in a record $900 million in total premium payments. Essentially, Parker associates the record activity with one or a few massive players scrambling, not routine trading. Shreyas Chari, director of trading and head of derivatives at Monarq Asset Management put it best: "Systematic selling across the majors yesterday probably tied to margin calls especially in the ETF with the highest crypto exposure IBIT." "Rumors swirled of a short options entity that had to sell the underlying far more aggressively after 70k and then 65k broke, probably tied to liquidation levels. This exacerbated the move down to 60k," he explained in a Telegram chat. Options expert disagrees Tony Stewart, founder of Pelion Capital and an options expert, believes IBIT options added to the market chaos, but doesn't go so far as to blame a single fund blowup for the whole crash and record activity. He argued on X , citing Amberdata, that $150 million of the $900 million in premiums came from buying back put options. In short, traders who had previously sold (shorted) puts faced significant losses as IBIT crashed and those puts surged in value, so they repurchased them to cut their risk. Those were "certainly painful" closes, he said on X, adding that the remaining portion of the $900 in premiums comprised mostly smaller trades, which is pretty standard for the hectic trading day. In essence, to Stewart, the record activity is just the messy noise of a broadly panicked market, not a smoking gun pointing to a single way. “This [hedge fund blowup theory] is inconclusive from the Options standpoint. It also doesn't seem enough tbh in size," he concluded. Still, he acknowledged the possibility that some activity could have been hidden in over-the-counter (privately negotiated) deals. Conclusion While Parker connected the dots to point to a hedge fund blowup, Stewart challenged the same with hard data. In any case, this episode highlights that IBIT options are now large enough to wield influence, and traders might want to keep track of them just as they do ETF inflows.

Ad Disclosure Bitcoin’s (BTC) slide below the $65,000 mark this week has rippled far beyond the crypto market, dragging down mining stocks and weighing on Asian equities already under pressure from a global tech sell-off. The world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly dipped just above $60,000, its lowest level in about 15 months, before attempting a modest rebound. Even with that recovery, sentiment across digital assets and related equities remains fragile as investors reassess risk in an uncertain macro environment. BTC's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Whales Retreat As Sentiment Deteriorates On-chain data shows a notable shift in Bitcoin ownership during the sell-off. According to Santiment , whales and sharks, controlling between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have reduced their share of Bitcoin’s circulating supply to around 68.04%, a nine-month low. The large Bitcoin holders have sold roughly 81,000 BTC over the past eight days, coinciding with Bitcoin’s drop from near $90,000 to the mid-$60,000 range. Similarly, smaller investors have continued to accumulate. Wallets holding less than 0.1 BTC reached a 20-month high in their share of supply, suggesting retail buyers are stepping in as prices fall. Historically, similar patterns, large holders selling into retail demand, have been associated with prolonged bear phases. Reflecting this shift, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 9 out of 100, its lowest level since mid-2022. Mining Stocks Slide Amid Bitcoin Weakness The pressure on Bitcoin has translated quickly into losses for crypto-linked equities . Shares of major mining firms and Bitcoin proxies such as Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Hut 8, and Strategy Inc. posted double-digit declines, with several hitting new 52-week lows. Strategy, one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders, reported a sharply wider quarterly loss as falling prices weighed on the value of its holdings, adding to concerns about balance sheet risk if weakness persists. Analysts note that the sell-off in miners has been largely macro-driven rather than tied to company-specific developments, reflecting their role as high-beta bets on Bitcoin’s price. Asian Markets Feel The Spillover Bitcoin’s drop also weighed on Asian markets , which were already tracking Wall Street’s losses, led by technology stocks. Equity benchmarks in South Korea, Hong Kong, and Australia declined, while Japan’s Nikkei managed modest gains after earlier losses. Market players cited a broader risk-off mood linked to concerns over U.S. monetary policy, particularly following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair, a move seen as less supportive of easy liquidity. With Bitcoin now down roughly half from its October peak, investors remain cautious. While short-term rebounds are possible, continued selling by large holders and tightening financial conditions suggest volatility across crypto assets, mining stocks, and global markets is likely to persist.

Its erosion can be reflected in the price performances across related tokens too. As expected, ZEC has not been immune to such a broader decline. In fact, the altcoin fell by approximately 16% over the last 24 hours alone as selling pressure intensified. And yet, on the one-hour charts, some signs of stablization between $218 and $212 could be seen too. Fair value gap signals downside risk before recovery At the time of writing, the altcoin’s price structure suggested that ZEC’s prevailing weakness may not be nearing exhaustion. On the daily timeframe, for instance, the crypto formed a Fair Value Gap (FVG) – Alluding to the presence of unfilled market orders. An FVG typically acts as a magnet for the price. When positioned above the press time price, it often serves as a sell-side zone. On the contrary, an FVG below the price functions as a demand zone. On the charts, the identified FVG lay below the price and represented a demand area. While this finding might support the case for a rebound, it also suggested that the price may need to trade into this zone before a sustained recovery develops. At press time, this range sat between $116 and $77 – Representing the extreme bearish-to-bullish scenario. Source: TradingView The depth of any further decline will largely depend on whether the support level that triggered ZEC’s prior 270% rally—culminating in its all-time high of $750 just over a month ago—continues to hold. That same support level seemed to be forming a recognizable double bottom pattern, with the price aligning around $202.44. Historically, this structure has often preceded bullish reversals. While not a guarantee, the pattern increases the probability that buyers may defend this zone once again – Providing a technical basis for a rebound attempt. Liquidity clusters, perpetual market favor upside movement Liquidity distribution also seemed to support the rebound thesis. At press time, the market structure underlined minimal liquidity below the spot price, reducing the incentive for aggressive downside continuation. Liquidity clusters highlight areas where large orders are concentrated. When liquidity is heavier above the price, markets tend to gravitate upwards to fill those orders. On the charts, liquidity appeared to be notably denser above press time price levels, particularly between $250 and $260. A move towards this zone would align with the previously identified, unlabeled FVG zone, reinforcing the technical case for a near-term upside move. Source: CoinGlass Perpetual market data has also been leaning constructive. Open Interest (OI) weighted funding rates were positive, indicating stronger positioning from long participants relative to shorts. Here, the OI-weighted funding rate measures which side of the derivatives market exerts greater control. Sustained positive readings means that long-side liquidity will continue to dominate. Such accumulation of demand from perpetual traders could influence directional bias, supporting further upside from the press time support zone. Spot market inflows signal retail interest Finally, Spot market activity hinted at renewed interest from retail investors too. On Thursday, 7 February, ZEC saw its largest single-day spot inflows since 31 January, with $13.7 million worth of tokens moved into private wallets. However, early data for Friday revealed sellers temporarily regaining control, with net outflows of $5.69 million exceeding buyer purchases. Such a shift remains fluid, and flows could still rebalance by the end of the trading session. Source: CoinGlass Despite short-term volatility, the altcoin’s price structure, liquidity positioning, derivatives data, and recent spot inflows all suggest that the probability of a rebound remains elevated. Market sentiment continues to favor recovery too. However, confirmation will depend on how the price reacts around key support and liquidity zones in the sessions ahead. Final Thoughts ZEC has been constrained between two key technical levels that are likely to determine whether the altcoin stages an immediate recovery or extends its decline. Liquidity formation and perpetual market activity might hint at a possible upside.16:T11a4,Crypto market rebounds $211 billion as total cap tests $2.37 trillion resistance. Bitcoin attempts reclaim $70,000 support, targeting $75,000 and $80,000 levels near-term recovery. XDC surges 23 percent, leading altcoins as price holds $0.0370 support level. The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin (BTC) finally broke free from the bearish curse they had been under for the past 12 days. As BTC neared $70,000, it sparked a rally amongst the altcoins as well, led by XDC Network (XDC). In the news today:- Sponsored Sponsored Vitalik Buterin donated to Shielded Labs to support Crosslink , a proposed Zcash consensus upgrade focused on privacy and stronger finality. Crosslink adds a parallel confirmation layer that reduces reorg risk, enabling faster exchange settlements, safer bridges, and more reliable applications on Zcash. Metaplanet reaffirmed its long-term Bitcoin strategy despite a sharp market sell-off that briefly pushed BTC near $60,000. CEO Simon Gerovich acknowledged shareholder pain as the firm’s stock tracked broader crypto market volatility. The Crypto Market Breaths a Sigh Of Relief The total crypto market cap rebounded by $211 billion over the past 24 hours, signaling a relief rally after Thursday’s sharp sell-off. The recovery has improved short-term sentiment across digital assets. Closing the week in positive territory could help stabilize markets and support risk appetite through the weekend. TOTAL is trading near $2.36 trillion at the time of writing, hovering just below the $2.37 trillion resistance. A decisive flip of this level into support would confirm strengthening momentum. Such a move could open the path for a continued advance toward the $2.45 trillion zone. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . TOTAL Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risk remains if bullish momentum fades. Failure to secure $2.37 trillion in support may trigger renewed selling pressure. Under this scenario, TOTAL could slip below the $2.30 trillion level and fall toward $2.22 trillion, erasing a significant portion of the recent recovery. Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin Attempts Recovery Bitcoin is trading near $69,972 at the time of writing as it attempts to reclaim $70,000. This level remains a key psychological threshold for market participants. A successful flip into support would signal renewed buyer confidence and mark the early stages of a broader recovery attempt. The immediate objective is to secure $70,000 as support and push higher toward $75,000. Achieving this would confirm improving momentum and strengthen bullish structure. If buying pressure persists, Bitcoin could regain traction and set its sights on the $80,000 level in the near term. BTC Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Failure to reclaim $70,000 would weaken the recovery narrative. Renewed selling pressure could drag Bitcoin back toward $65,000 or lower. Such a move would invalidate the bullish thesis, reinforce downside risk, and prolong market uncertainty amid fragile investor sentiment. XDC Network Jumps Sharply XDC led the altcoin market, surging 23% over the past 24 hours to trade near $0.0370 at the time of writing. The rally reflects renewed buying interest and improving sentiment. Securing this level of support is critical for sustaining momentum and confirming the strength of the current price move. XDC is now targeting a move toward $0.0413, but a breakout requires clearing the $0.0392 resistance. Rising inflows and sustained investor participation could provide the needed catalyst. A decisive breach would validate bullish continuation and strengthen confidence in XDC’s short-term recovery trajectory. XDC Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risk remains if support fails to hold. A loss of $0.0370 could push XDC back toward $0.0345. Breaking below that level would expose price to a deeper pullback near $0.0299, erasing much of the recent recovery and weakening the bullish setup.

Guest intro Edward Woodford is the co-founder and CEO of Zero Hash, a crypto infrastructure platform powering digital asset products for financial services platforms. Previously, he co-founded Seed CX, a US-based CFTC-registered derivatives execution venue. Under his leadership, Zero Hash has processed over $45 billion in transactions and enabled Fortune 500 companies like Stripe and Franklin Templeton to integrate stablecoins. The industry’s focus on interest rates “The current focus on interest rates is overshadowing more pressing issues in the industry.” – Edward Woodford The emphasis on interest rates detracts from addressing other critical challenges. “There are so many issues we still have to deal with and we’re somehow giving too much weight to this interest rate conversation.” – Edward Woodford Understanding broader financial and regulatory challenges is crucial. Misalignment in focus could impact future developments in the crypto industry. The industry needs to prioritize more pressing regulatory and market structure issues. Interest rates are receiving disproportionate attention compared to other factors. A shift in focus could lead to better outcomes for the crypto market.

The wider crypto market turmoil has barely affected DCR, which retained its long-term uptrend. Bitcoin [BTC] has shed 4.69% in the past 24 hours adn 19.95% in the past week. In a post on X , the hybrid consensus crypto asserted that it builds on Bitcoin’s blockchain model by bringing on-chain governance and privacy, among other aspects. This privacy narrative likely drove the November rally, as ZCash [ZEC] approached $750. Back then, AMBCrypto pointed out that overheated spot markets could see a DCR pullback . Decred remains long-term bullish Source: DCR/USDT on TradingView Decred saw a steep pullback after its nearly vertical rally in the first week of November. At that time, DCR had rallied from $20.23 to $68.44 in just 16 hours. This was an incredible 238% move that was wiped out entirely in a month. Yet, as the 3-day chart showed, the $40 resistance zone had been overcome, if only briefly. This signaled bullish strength. Additionally, no major swing lows have been broken on the D3 chart. The altcoin has set a series of higher lows throughout 2025 and continued the trend into 2026. The OBV made higher highs to reinforce the strength of the buying. The CMF, another volume indicator with a slightly more nuanced calculation, showed that capital inflows were not consistent during the rallies. Sustained demand instead of a few high-volume sessions to prop up the uptrend would be more welcome. Lower timeframes show DCR opportunity Source: DCR/USDT on TradingView From the 21st of January to the 6th of February, DCR was trading within a range (purple) that stretched from $17 to $21.36. Recent hours of trading saw a decisive, high-volume bullish breakout. This breakout, especially at a time of BTC weakness, will attract investors’ attention. A retest of the $21 range highs could offer a buying opportunity targeting $26 and $27.8, the local highs made in January. Why traders should wait and watch It is highly tempting to buy the relative bullish strength of Decred right away. Yet, the range breakout gave a short-term pullback target. A retest of $21 can be monitored for a bullish reaction before buying. Final Thoughts The Decred higher timeframe trend has been bullish, evident from the series of higher lows it set throughout the past year. The lower timeframe range breakout could see a pullback toward $21 before a bullish continuation toward $27.8.

Ad Disclosure Ripple on Thursday published an “Institutional DeFi” roadmap for the XRP Ledger (XRPL), positioning XRP as a protocol-level settlement and liquidity primitive across payments, FX, collateral workflows, and on-ledger credit. The company’s pitch is straightforward: compliance tooling and asset-layer primitives are already live on mainnet, with lending, privacy, and permissioned market infrastructure slated to round out a more institution-friendly stack over the coming quarters. In its post , Ripple framed the roadmap as an evolution from a fast settlement network into something closer to a full financial operating environment for regulated workflows. The blog argues that with “native onchain privacy, permissioned markets, and institutional lending” expected “in the coming months,” XRPL is aiming to become “an end-to-end operating system for real-world finance,” with institutions able to run compliant processes without pushing additional complexity onto end users. RippleX summarized the roadmap in a companion post, saying XRP sits “at the center of settlement, FX, collateral, and onchain credit,” and that 2026 focus areas include lending, privacy, and permissioned on-chain markets. The roadmap leans heavily on the idea that XRP demand can be driven both directly and indirectly. Directly, Ripple points to new functionality that could increase transaction volume and asset issuance, raising demand for network resources. Indirectly, it highlights XRP’s role in base-layer mechanics such as reserve requirements, transaction fees (which burn XRP), and bridging in FX and lending flows. Ripple organizes this into three institutional pillars: payments/FX, collateral/liquidity, and credit/financing. On payments and FX, it emphasizes “ Permissioned Domains ,” where access is gated via “Credentials” (e.g., KYC/AML attestations), and a planned Permissioned DEX that would extend XRPL’s existing exchange rails into controlled, regulated contexts for secondary markets in FX, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. In those permissioned market flows, Ripple says XRP functions as an auto-bridge asset between tokens and stablecoins, while each transaction consumes fees paid in XRP. On collateral and liquidity, Ripple spotlights Token Escrow and Batch Transactions as building blocks for conditional settlement and atomic delivery-versus-payment workflows, alongside the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, which it describes as a way to embed metadata and restrictions for complex instruments without custom contracts. The thesis here is that tokenized collateral issuance, escrowed settlement, and DvP-style flows expand on-ledger activity that still depends on XRP reserves and fees at the protocol layer. The most explicit “institutional DeFi” expansion comes in credit. Ripple says XRPL v3.1.0 will introduce native on-ledger credit markets via a lending stack built around Single-Asset Vaults and the XLS-66 Lending Protocol, designed for fixed-term, underwritten loans with repayment automation. Underwriting and risk management remain off-chain, while the loan contracts and mechanics live on-ledger. What Ripple Says Is Next Ripple’s post distinguishes between primitives already available and a near-term pipeline. Live today, it lists MPT, Credentials, Permissioned Domains, transaction “Simulate” tooling for preflight-style risk reduction, “Deep Freeze” controls for issuers, Token Escrow and Batch Transactions, plus an XRPL EVM sidechain bridged via Axelar for Solidity-based deployments that tap XRPL liquidity and identity features. On the roadmap, Ripple highlights a Permissioned DEX targeted for Q2, the XLS-65/66 lending protocol for later in 2026, “Confidential Transfers” for MPTs using zero-knowledge proofs in Q1, and “Smart Escrows” and MPT DEX integration in Q2—alongside an “Institutional DeFi Portal” intended to bundle tokenization, lending, and payments exploration in one place.

Investigators are reviewing unverified Bitcoin ransom claims, reportedly demanding millions in crypto. A man was arrested for a fake Bitcoin extortion attempt, separate from the abduction case. Nancy Guthrie, an elderly 84-year-old woman, vanished overnight in Arizona, triggering a high-stakes investigation with alleged crypto demands. She is the mother of popular NBC journalist and TODAY show host Savannah Guthrie. Authorities believe she was likely taken from her home after a violent encounter. Sponsored Sponsored Blood at the Doorstep Turns Missing Case Criminal Investigators found blood spatter at the entrance of her residence in the Catalina Foothills area near Tucson, Arizona. Forensic testing confirmed the blood belonged to Nancy Guthrie, according to law enforcement. As a result, what began as a missing-person report has escalated into a suspected kidnapping investigation. Nancy Guthrie lived a private, low-profile life and was not a public figure. She became nationally known only because of her daughter’s role as a senior anchor on NBC’s Today . Family members last saw her on the evening of January 31 after dropping her home. She failed to attend church the next morning, raising immediate concern. Her phone, wallet, car, and medication were all left behind. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department, with assistance from the FBI, is leading the investigation. Sponsored Sponsored Deputies also discovered that her doorbell camera had been removed or disabled, reinforcing concerns that she did not leave voluntarily. So far, authorities have named no suspects and confirmed no proof of life. Bitcoin Ransom Claims Add a Crypto Twist The case took a darker turn after multiple alleged ransom communications surfaced, some referencing Bitcoin payments . Sponsored Sponsored Media reports describe a purported ransom note demanding “millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin” , complete with deadlines and a wallet address. However, police have not confirmed the authenticity of any ransom demand or verified that it came from whoever took her. Crucially, investigators stress that no confirmed captor has made direct contact with the family. Sponsored Sponsored Fake Bitcoin Extortion Attempt Clouds the Case Separately, authorities arrested Derrick Callella , a California man accused of sending fraudulent Bitcoin-related messages to members of the Guthrie family. Law enforcement says Callella is not connected to the kidnapping and acted independently, highlighting the rise of opportunistic crypto scams during high-profile cases. Investigation Ongoing, Answers Still Missing Savannah Guthrie has stepped away from broadcasting duties as the search continues. For now, investigators say the focus remains on locating Nancy Guthrie and determining who took her, how, and why —with the Bitcoin angle still unverified and under review.

Unusual trading in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) , has led traders to speculate that this week’s sharp Bitcoin drop may have been triggered by one or more Hong Kong–based hedge funds, rather than selling pressure from crypto traders. The theory was laid out in a post on X by Parker White, the COO and CIO of DeFi Development Corp, and centers around record trading and options activity in IBIT. Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply over the past week, dropping 16%, and trading as low as $62,000 on Thursday before rebounding to around $70,400 on Friday, per CoinGecko. On Thursday, IBIT recorded its highest daily trading volume to date, with about $10.7 billion traded. Despite the heavy volume, IBIT recorded only $175 million in net outflows, according to SoSoValue. White cited several signals suggesting that selling pressure did not come from crypto-native traders, including relatively low liquidations on centralized crypto exchanges and unusual price action in BTC and Solana (SOL). “Given these facts and the way $BTC and $SOL traded down in lockstep today (normally SOL trades with beta) + the relatively lower liquidations on CeFi exchanges, this leads me to believe that the nexus of the problem lies with a large IBIT holder,” the post reads. “IBIT has become the #1 venue for BTC options trading, so my guess is that a hedge fund trading IBIT options is the culprit.” White said public filings show that some funds hold a very large share (and in some cases nearly all) of their assets in IBIT. He added that many of those IBIT-focused funds are based in Hong Kong and do not normally trade crypto, which could explain why traders didn’t see warning signs ahead of the selloff. He also pointed to activity in $DFDV, a fund tied to DeFi Development Corp, which he said posted its worst single-day decline on record, alongside a sharp drop in its net asset value. “I personally know a number of HK-based hedge funds that are holders of $DFDV … the mNAV had been holding steady surprisingly well throughout this pull back until today.” White wrote, adding that he finds it unlikely a fund running a large IBIT position through a single-entity structure would operate only one vehicle. White cautioned that while he has no hard evidence, “just some hunches and bread crumbs,” he believes his theory seems “very plausible.” Other experts echoed parts of White’s view, noting that the size and structure of the move did not resemble a typical crypto-driven selloff. Rob Wallace, co-founder of BitcoinNews.com, agreed that the combination of factors mentioned by White looks more like institutional selling than a retail panic. He also said IBIT has become an important link between traditional markets and BTC trading. Still, White and other traders emphasized that the clearest confirmation would come from regulatory filings showing a large IBIT position being reduced to zero.1c:T17f9,Cover image via www.freepik.com Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Unfortunately, a quick recovery will not come after such a devastating drop, even though XRP, Bitcoin and Shiba Inu are extremely oversold at this point in time. But at least we are seeing the stabilization of selling pressure. XRP buying volume surges XRP has recently seen a sharp increase in buying activity, with market volume peaking close to $500 million, indicating a sudden return of liquidity and speculative interest. The move occurs at a crucial technical juncture, as XRP recently dropped to new local lows after declining steadily for weeks in a lower channel. The price action of XRP over the last few sessions exhibited near-capitulation behavior, as aggressive sell-offs drove the asset below a number of significant support zones, but the latest trading sessions reveal a sudden surge of buyers entering the market just as the price reached extremely oversold territory. HOT Stories XRP/USDT Chart by TradingView Technically, XRP is currently among the market's most oversold major assets. Momentum indicators, which are frequently connected to exhaustion in selling pressure, stay pinned close to oversold zones. As sellers lose steam and buyers start building positions, these circumstances typically come before brief recoveries or periods of consolidation. Additionally, the abrupt increase in purchasing volume gives XRP's market structure new momentum. When liquidity picks back up after significant drawdowns, it frequently fosters relief rallies, particularly when leveraged short positions start to close and push prices higher. If momentum persists, XRP might try to recover adjacent resistance levels, which could temporarily stabilize price action. But investors need to exercise caution. Strong volume spikes can occasionally be short-term speculative reactions rather than complete trend reversals, and the overall trend is still bearish. The price may find it difficult to maintain recovery gains in the absence of consistent follow-through buying. This is when XRP starts to be intriguing, mainly from a speculative standpoint. Short-term traders find deep oversold conditions and abrupt liquidity inflows to be appealing setups, but the price must still reclaim important technical zones for long-term confirmation. Shiba Inu stays up The price behavior of Shiba Inu has been surprisingly resilient despite the fact that the larger cryptocurrency market is still struggling due to ongoing selling pressure. SHIB has avoided the kind of catastrophic breakdown that many large-cap coins have experienced, producing what appears to be relative bullish strength in the current environment as major assets decline toward multimonth lows and market sentiment wanes. The ability of SHIB to withstand market declines may initially indicate robust accumulation or rekindled investor interest; the reality, however, seems much less dramatic. You Might Also Like The current resilience is more closely related to liquidity conditions than it is to a sudden change in long-term sentiment or fundamentals. To put it plainly, Shiba Inu is trading in a market with less liquidity than well-known assets like Ethereum or Bitcoin. When liquidity declines, fewer people are actively trading the asset, making price movements less susceptible to overall market movements. Because of this, SHIB does not always replicate the forceful sell-offs observed in markets with greater liquidity, giving the appearance of strength. After a protracted decline, recent price action indicates that SHIB is stabilizing, with buyers entering around nearby support zones. Additionally, momentum indicators indicate that selling pressure has decreased, allowing for temporary consolidation or even slight rallies on the token. However, investors should not mistake relative stability for a bullish reversal that has been confirmed. The overall trend is still weak, and if the market-wide risk-off attitude persists, SHIB may eventually experience fresh pressure, when selling spreads more evenly among altcoins or liquidity returns. Bitcoin enters sell-off With price action currently testing levels that many traders did not anticipate seeing revisited this cycle, Bitcoin's most recent sell-off has forced the market into one of its most critical zones in recent history. Bitcoin is trying to stabilize close to current levels after losing important technical support in quick succession, but there is still a lot of uncertainty. There are reasons to believe that things could get better from here. First, momentum indicators indicate that on higher time frames, Bitcoin is approaching deeply oversold territory, which has historically resulted in relief rallies. Additionally, volume spikes during the most recent decline point to capitulation-like behavior, in which longer-term buyers start to replace weaker hands as they exit positions. You Might Also Like However, it is impossible to overlook the bearish scenario. With the price regularly marking lower highs and trading below significant moving averages, the overall trend is still downward. Bitcoin could easily move toward the psychologically crucial $50,000 mark if selling pressure persists and sentiment on the macro or risk markets deteriorates. To put it briefly, Bitcoin is at a turning point. Although there are still no obvious indications of sustained accumulation on the market, a technical bounce is still possible. There is still a chance of more declines until Bitcoin regains important resistance levels, and testing $50,000 is not completely out of the question.1d:Td6e,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure Tether has put a big bet on bullion. Reports say the stablecoin issuer bought a roughly $150 million stake in Gold.com, taking about 12% of the shares at a price that undercuts recent trading. That move follows signals that both firms want to tie physical gold markets to digital tokens more closely. Investors reacted with a mix of curiosity and caution. Tether Takes A Stake Reports note the deal gives Tether the right to name a board member at Gold.com. That matters because it means more than money changes hands; it opens a direct line between a major crypto issuer and a major bullion distributor. The firms plan to explore a gold leasing facility of at least $100 million, a step that could help move metal without always shifting cash around. Gold.com will also accept Tether’s stablecoins, including USDT and USAT, as part of the collaboration.

Part of the cash will be put toward Tether’s gold-backed token, XAU₮. That could make XAU₮ more usable in everyday trades, and it might give buyers a clearer path from a crypto wallet to physical bullion. Some traders think this helps gold tokens gain credibility. Others worry a big crypto player stepping into metal markets will raise fresh questions about custody, audit practices, and how price moves will be reported. BTCUSD now trading at $65,917. Chart: TradingView Market Reaction And Risk Equity traders noticed the shares were bought at close to 12% discount to recent levels, which suggests a negotiated, strategic purchase rather than a public market run. Buyers in the bullion trade care about storage, insurance, and counterparty trust. Reports have disclosed that linking stablecoins and physical assets raises both promise and regulatory scrutiny. Regulators in several regions are already watching how tokenized assets are structured. That scrutiny could shape how fast this partnership scales. Distribution And Token Plans Gold.com and Tether appear set to build new on-ramps. Imagine buying bullion and immediately receiving a token that represents the metal, or using USDT to pay for vault storage without fiat rails. The plan to put a portion of funds into XAU₮ suggests token holders might see more liquidity and more places to spend or move their gold exposure. That could cut friction for buyers who prefer digital settlement.

Off-screen, he's a cook and cinephile who's constantly intrigued by the size of the universe.1e:T12bd,Journalist Posted: February 7, 2026 Investors’ interest in Chainlink [LINK] has surged notably despite the bearish market sentiment and the ongoing decline in the asset’s price. Over the past few days, the broader crypto market has shifted sharply to the downside, with that shift clearly reflected in LINK’s price action, as the token has lost several key support levels. At press time, LINK lost 12.75% of its value over the past 24 hours and was trading at $8.01. At the same time, investor and trader participation has surged significantly, reflected in a 76% jump in trading volume to $2.02 billion. Rising volume during a price decline signals growing fear, as it suggests market participants are increasingly aligned with the current bearish trend. Investors eyes accumulation However, when it comes to investor behavior, the trend appears quite unusual, as they seem to be adding tokens to their holdings. On-chain analytics platform SoSoValue disclosed that on the 5th of February 2026, U.S. spot LINK exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $1.18 million. This ETF inflow indicates that Wall Street investors are deploying fresh capital into these funds, signaling increased exposure to LINK tokens. Source: SoSoValue In addition to ETF activity, exchange reserves have also declined over the past 24 hours, according to the analytics platform CryptoQuant . Data shows that Chainlink’s total exchange reserves across all platforms fell from 130,807,419 LINK to 130,270,399 LINK, a decrease of 537,020 LINK tokens. This notable drop in exchange reserves suggests potential accumulation, as assets are being moved off exchanges into private wallets. Source: CryptoQuant LINK price action and key levels to watch Looking at the daily chart, it appears that LINK’s recent decline has broken down a long-standing support level at $8.35, which the asset had held since October 2023. Source: TradingView However, during this drop, the price also tested another support near $7.20 and now appears to be experiencing a potential reversal. This level previously acted as a consolidation zone for an extended period before LINK broke out above $8.35 back in 2023. Based on past performance and current price action, if LINK sustains above the $7.20 level and reclaims $8.35, a potential reversal could unfold. However, if the price fails to hold $7.20 support, it may extend its downside momentum, potentially dropping another 20% to $5.85 in the coming days. At the time of writing, the Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the strength of an asset’s trend, reached 50.63, well above the key threshold of 25, indicating a strong directional trend in LINK’s price movement. Traders lean bearish From a derivatives perspective, intraday traders appear to be following the prevailing trend. According to CoinGlass’ LINK Exchange Liquidation Map, traders are heavily positioned around the $7.91 level on the downside and the $8.42 level on the upside. At these levels, they have built approximately $1.44 million in long leveraged positions and $4.32 million in short leveraged positions. Source: CoinGlass This imbalance clearly reflects bearish market sentiment. Final Thoughts Following a 10% price dip, Chainlink (LINK) has lost control of its long-standing support at $8.35, a level the asset had held since October 2023. Despite this sharp decline and key breakdown, investors appear to be accumulating tokens, while intraday traders continue to follow the prevailing bearish trend.

MegaETH, the real-time blockchain and Ethereum Layer 2, is launching its mainnet on Feb. 9, but the token generation event (TGE) will be dependent on network performance milestones. The MegaLabs team has defined three key performance indicators (KPIs), and at least one of these must be met for the TGE to proceed. The chain must either establish a baseline of $500 million in USDM circulating, see 10 “mafia mainnet”- aligned apps deployed with more than 100,000 transactions across at least 25,000 wallets, or host three apps that generate at least $50,000 in daily fees for 30 days. Once the token is circulating, MegaETH will use priority fees from its proximity markets and yield from its native stablecoin, USDM, for MEGA token buybacks. In an article , MegaETH co-founder Shuyao Kong said, “The largest issue that's faced our industry over the past few years was a simple question: why does a token need to exist? Equity has acted as king, with every successful story over the past few years, barring hyperliquid, having some variation of equity.” The community-focused approach has been well received, but pre-market derivatives still price MEGA at just a $1.3 billion fully diluted valuation, only 40% higher than its initial coin offering (ICO) price in October.

Ethereum’s evolving role as L2s shift from “branded shards” to sovereign systems. (Credits: ChatGPT) Posted February 6, 2026 at 6:37 pm EST. Over the past week, Bitcoin fell from roughly $84,000 to a low near $60,000 before reclaiming the $70,000 level, one of the sharpest drawdowns the market has seen in years. ETH also dropped from $2,700 to nearly $1,800, but is now above $2,000. This piece isn’t about the crash itself, but periods like this tend to force a reset in how investors think about what they own and why — and Vitalik Buterin’s latest blog post about Ethereum’s direction sets a new tone for ETH. On Tuesday, Vitalik Buterin said the original vision of layer 2s as branded shards “no longer makes sense.” The post wasn’t a technical update so much as a concession. After years of treating L2s as Ethereum’s primary scaling path, Vitalik is now acknowledging what critics had argued all along: that L2s evolved into economically sovereign systems with incentives that do not always align with the base layer. For example, figures in the Solana ecosystem, including Max Resnick and Kyle Samani, have long warned that rollups siphon activity from L1 without reliably returning value and that Ethereum’s roadmap was utterly wrong. Ethereum largely ignored those views until the post-Dencun reality made them harder to dismiss. Dencun, a March 2024 upgrade, slashed rollup data costs and worked as intended, but it also accelerated the migration of activity off L1, weakening fee burn and the “ultrasound money” narrative. After that, many started questioning L2s, calling them “parasitic.” Vitalik’s post is the clearest acknowledgment yet that the old model is over. Ethereum no longer needs L2s as “branded shards,” as he called them in his blog post, and many L2s are “not able or willing” to meet those assumptions anyway. Now, what does this all mean for $ETH and other L2 tokens? In the rest of this article, we’ll move past protocol design and into market consequences: what this reframing means for L2 tokens , why generic rollups are facing a narrative reset , how Base benefits, which types of L2s (and tokens ) actually benefit from the world Vitalik is describing, what it means for $ETH .

And this bear market could extend for several months before it fully bottoms, according to Bitwise’s Matt Hougan. Summary Bitcoin’s recent drop is driven by factors like investors preemptively adjusting to the four-year cycle, competition from AI and metals, and a major leveraged liquidation event. While the market has fallen 54% from its peak, previous downturns have been more severe, Hougan says. Regulatory progress and innovation will drive future growth, Hougan says. Fortune favors patient investors. Although Bitcoin has shown a brief recovery, trading nearly 50% below its all-time high, investors are left grappling with questions: Why is the market down? Could it fall further? And when will it bottom? 6 key factors According to Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, there are several complex reasons behind the current crypto market downturn, but six primary factors stand out. The Four-Year Cycle : A major reason for the pullback is that long-term investors have been selling to preemptively adjust for the four-year market cycle, where crypto sees strong bull years followed by inevitable pullbacks. Investors, wary of a repeat of previous cycles, have sold significant portions of their holdings—estimated to be over $100 billion in Bitcoin last year alone. Competition from Other Markets : Crypto has enjoyed significant retail interest, but now AI stocks and precious metals are pulling some attention away. “Attention investors,” who flocked to crypto in recent years, are now diverting their capital elsewhere. The October 10 Leverage Liquidation : The crypto market also faced the largest leveraged liquidation event in history following an unexpected announcement by former President Donald Trump. This event triggered panic selling in the absence of traditional market liquidity, further depressing prices. Concerns Over Federal Reserve Leadership : President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve Chair raised concerns, particularly among investors who feared Warsh’s hawkish stance on interest rates, creating unease in broader markets, including crypto. Rising Fears of Quantum Computing : There’s a growing anxiety within the crypto community about the potential threat of quantum computing, which could undermine the security of Bitcoin. While many believe it’s a long-term issue, the lack of visible action has led some investors to retreat from the market. Macro Risk-Off Sentiment : A broader shift in global markets towards risk-off sentiment has affected Bitcoin. Alongside Bitcoin’s struggles, other assets like gold, silver, and tech stocks have also seen steep declines. Could crypto fall further? While the market’s current drawdown of 54% from its peak seems severe, Hougan cautions that it could go lower. Previous downturns have been much larger—Bitcoin fell 86% in 2014, 84% in 2018, and 77% in 2022. Historical trends suggest that bear markets typically last 12-13 months, so this current slump might not be over yet. However, given crypto’s maturing nature, a 77% drop seems unlikely, though it remains a possibility. What could help it recover? For many seasoned investors, this moment feels similar to past bear markets in 2018 and 2022, which were followed by massive rallies. Investors who bought the dip in those years saw substantial returns—around 2,000% from 2018 and 300% from 2022. The fundamentals supporting crypto are still in place: a growing demand for digital currencies, increasing regulatory clarity, and innovations like tokenization and stablecoins continue to drive the sector forward. The timing of the market bottom remains uncertain, but recovery often comes through time and exhaustion. Specific catalysts could accelerate recovery, such as regulatory developments like the Clarity Act, the continued rise of AI-linked crypto projects, or a return to risk-on market sentiment. For now, Hougan advises patience. While it’s impossible to predict the exact moment the market will turn, the long-term outlook for crypto remains promising for those with the fortitude to weather the storm. Crypto markets are volatile, and the current downturn could continue in the short term, Hougan adds. However, for investors with a long-term perspective, history suggests that bear markets often precede significant growth. With key factors like regulatory advancements and growing adoption still in play, he argues that crypto’s future still holds substantial upside, making the current moment a potential buying opportunity for those prepared to wait.23:T1104,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure Bitcoin (BTC) has just formed a textbook inverse Head & Shoulders pattern, signaling the beginning of a potential shift in its market structure. Despite the broader market selloff that pushed the cryptocurrency below $70,000, a crypto analyst suggests that the newly formed pattern indicates that a fresh bullish trend could be up ahead. Bitcoin Head & Shoulder Pattern Signals Price Reversal In an X post this Thursday, market analyst Crypto Tice declared that Bitcoin has printed a classic inverse Head & Shoulders pattern on its chart, renewing the debate over whether the market is on the verge of another historic breakout. He said that this pattern is a textbook structural signal that has formed over an extended period on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Historical Performance Shows How Low The Price Will Go Before A Bottom The chart highlights three distinct phases in Bitcoin’s price action, showing how the inverse Head and Shoulder pattern formed. The first stage saw a “Left Shoulder” emerge after an initial rally, followed by a deep decline that shaped the head of the Head and Shoulders pattern. Subsequently, prices climbed again to create a higher “Right Shoulder,” signaling that sellers were losing momentum while bulls were gradually asserting control. A horizontal line across the previous swing highs on the price chart marks the neckline of the inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, which Crypto Tice highlights as a pivotal level for determining Bitcoin’s next major trend. According to him, Bitcoin is currently retesting this trendline, as a breakout from here could set the stage for a potential price rally . Source: Chart from Crypto Tice on X Crypto Tice highlighted that the current retest should not be seen as a sign of weakness, but as confirmation that Bitcoin’s structure is still holding . He said that market sentiment at this stage often wavers among investors and traders. However, historical trends suggest that similar retests have preceded major price expansions. Crypto Tice noted that the inverse Head and Shoulder pattern is a critical signal that often signals a transition from accumulation to expansion. Historically, accumulation phases allow buying pressure to build, followed by a breakout, a controlled pullback, and finally a retest confirmation. Head & Shoulder Pattern Point To $215,000 Price Target Above the neckline of Bitcoin’s Head & Shoulder pattern, Crypto Tice has set a projected target of $215,000 on the chart, indicating where the market could move if BTC breaks out decisively. With the cryptocurrency currently trading above $65,000, this would represent a roughly 231% increase. Related Reading: Did Satoshi Nakamoto Sell 10,000 Bitcoin For $800 Million? Here’s The Truth Given the recent market downtrend and Bitcoin’s price breakdown below $70,000, the analyst acknowledged that a sudden move to $200,000 sounds largely unrealistic. However, he noted that the same perception was held in past cycles before Bitcoin skyrocketed to new all-time highs against the odds. Concluding his analysis, Crypto Tice explained that large price trends rarely begin comfortably, noting that they typically emerge amid market hesitation and uncertainty.

Literally, one small move and we could see a full-blown liquidity unwind. Makes you wonder: What exactly are investors HODLing for right now with all this volatility? On the big picture side, the market’s still bullish on U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto moves. The latest regulatory bills just add fuel, and Trump-backed World Liberty Financial [WLFI] is part of that wave. However, the technical picture tells a different story. With a 17.14% drop so far in 2026, Bitcoin [BTC] has effectively wiped out all of its post-election gains, retracing below the $63k election open price. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In essence, Bitcoin has erased all the gains since President Trump stepped into the White House in November 2024. With that in mind, it’s fair to ask: Is all the “hype” around his pro-crypto policies really justified? The broader picture adds more context. The USD Index has slid 8% since the election, hitting a 2022 low of 97, while gold is up roughly 77% over the same stretch, with inflation still running above the Fed’s 2% target. That’s the opposite of what the market expected pre-election, which makes you question: Is Bitcoin’s hype still riding on President Trump’s policies? And if that confidence starts to fade, could risk assets face a bigger unwind? WLFI Bitcoin dump tests confidence in Trump With conviction under pressure, timing is everything. The logic is simple: Bitcoin retracing back to pre-election levels is already making investors question President Trump’s pro-crypto momentum. Now, WLFI selling $50 million in BTC only adds more fuel to that doubt. The key question now is whether this move was just a strategic deleveraging, because the impact has been huge. Over 500k crypto traders got liquidated, with total liquidations hitting $2 billion after the news. Source: Coinglass Even so, confidence in Bitcoin hasn’t returned. Notably, WLFI’s BTC sell-off came alongside $434 million in BTC ETF outflows , with six of the top-ranked ETFs all posting outflows. BlackRock’s IBIT BTC ETF, for instance, alone saw $175 million in net outflows. Which brings us to the key question: Was this sell-off more than just a deleveraging event? With BTC down over 30% since Q4, HODLers are being forced to liquidate, and WLFI’s dump seems to fit right into that trend. On top of that, Bitcoin retracing back to pre-election levels, the muted impact of regulations on risk assets, and a bearish macro backdrop are all chipping away at confidence in President Trump’s pro-crypto momentum. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin retracing to pre-election levels, confidence in President Trump’s pro-crypto momentum is under question. USD down 8%, gold up 77%, muted regulatory impact, and a bearish macro backdrop are all fueling doubts about Bitcoin’s near-term outlook.

Pharma stocks rallied, showing investors see the policy as limited, voluntary, and not earnings-destructive. Markets, including crypto, stayed calm because TrumpRx does not raise inflation risk or tighten financial conditions. President Donald Trump this week launched TrumpRx, a government-backed platform aimed at lowering prescription drug prices for Americans paying out of pocket. While the announcement initially raised concerns about pricing pressure, financial markets have delivered a clear response. Major pharmaceutical stocks rallied on February 6, signaling that investors do not see TrumpRx as a near-term threat to earnings. That reaction also matters for broader markets, including crypto, because it shapes overall risk sentiment. LIFE-CHANGING HEALTHCARE INITIATIVE 🇺🇸 No more choosing between bills & health.

The platform lists dozens of commonly used drugs and directs users to discounted cash prices offered voluntarily by drugmakers and pharmacies. Crucially, it targets cash-paying and uninsured consumers . It does not affect insurance-negotiated prices, Medicare reimbursement formulas, or long-term supply contracts, which make up the bulk of US pharmaceutical revenue. TrumpRx Website But Investors Aren’t Panicking About Drug Profits Markets are signaling that TrumpRx trims the edges of pricing, not the core. Most pharmaceutical revenue comes from insured and institutional channels that remain untouched by the program. Sponsored For dominant players in high-demand categories like weight-loss and specialty drugs, pricing power remains strong. In some cases, lower cash prices may even boost volumes without materially hurting margins. US Big Pharma Stocks Actually Increased After TrumpRx Launch. Source: TradingView Voluntary Discounts, Not Forced Controls Another key factor is structure. Participation in TrumpRx is voluntary and tied to broader trade and supply-chain cooperation, including tariff relief . Sponsored For global drugmakers, reduced trade and regulatory risk can offset limited pricing concessions. That trade-off helps explain why the sector moved higher instead of lower. What This Means For Broader Markets The pharma rally sends a wider signal. Investors are not pricing in aggressive government intervention or profit-destroying regulation. That matters for equities and crypto alike . When policy actions appear contained and predictable, risk appetite stabilizes across markets. Sponsored Crypto Cares, Even Indirectly TrumpRx has no direct link to digital assets. However, crypto remains highly sensitive to policy uncertainty and financial conditions. By failing to trigger a regulatory shock or worsen inflation expectations, TrumpRx reduces the chance of a hawkish policy response from the Federal Reserve . Stable rate expectations ease pressure on volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Markets are treating TrumpRx as a political signal, not a systemic shock . The positive reaction in pharma stocks shows investors see the policy as narrow, voluntary, and economically contained. For crypto and risk assets, the takeaway is simple. TrumpRx does not tighten financial conditions or raise regulatory risk. Instead, it supports a backdrop of policy stability that allows markets to focus on liquidity, rates, and fundamentals rather than fear.

Bitcoin’s bounce from the $60,000 level helped ease fears of a deeper market correction, as it rose nearly 8% to reclaim the $70,000 mark. This surge also supported riskier altcoins like Litecoin, which is up about 8% for the day. Summary Bitcoin surged nearly 8% to reclaim the $70,000 level on Friday, easing fears of a deeper correction and supporting altcoins like Litecoin and Shiba Inu. Litecoin saw an 8% increase, trading around $54, as traders rotated into altcoins following Bitcoin’s recovery and reduced margin stress. Shiba Inu climbed about 7%, benefiting from Bitcoin’s rebound and renewed investor interest in higher-beta tokens. Why Bitcoin’s rise bodes well for Litecoin Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset in the crypto space, and when it rallies, traders typically rotate into altcoins like Litecoin. As Bitcoin stabilizes, the risk of forced selling and liquidation cascades decreases, allowing traders to take fresh positions in altcoins. This is particularly important after Bitcoin touched the $60,074 mark earlier on Friday, a key level that had traders on edge. The rebound reduced margin stress and bolstered sentiment across the market. Bitcoin’s price recovery also helped offset the concerns raised by figures like Michael Burry, who warned that miners could be forced to sell their Bitcoin holdings if the price dropped below $50,000. Litecoin’s Friday spike Litecoin, created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, has seen an uptick in interest as Bitcoin recovers. Known as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin benefits from a long track record and strong exchange support. As of Friday, Litecoin is trading around $54, having hit an intraday high of $56.25. Source: CoinGecko Shiba Inu follows Bitcoin’s lead Alongside Litecoin, meme-coin Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) also gained traction, climbing about 7%. As Bitcoin recovered from its Thursday slump, large investors redeployed capital across the market, pulling speculative coins like Shiba Inu back into the green. SHIB, which had faced pressure earlier in the week from market weakness and liquidations, is now benefiting from improved market sentiment. Source: CoinGecko What’s next for crypto? Bitcoin’s recovery is giving traders a window to reposition in the market, but caution remains. Analysts suggest that while short-term bounces are possible, broader market trends still point to volatility. Key resistance for Bitcoin sits in the $70,000 to $75,000 range, with some traders speculating on further upward movement. For now, the surge in Bitcoin’s price is driving positive sentiment in the market, with altcoins like Litecoin and Shiba Inu benefiting from the rebound.27:Tc89,Journalist Posted: February 7, 2026 Recent MYX Finance [MYX] momentum has shifted focus toward a potential breakout zone. MYX swept liquidity within the $4.58–$4.63 zone, triggering a sharp rebound as bids reacted at the range floor. Price then advanced, yet repeated rejection near $6.20–$6.40 capped upside, sustaining consolidation. Each pullback held above $4.63, signaling firm spot demand and persistent order-book support. Wicks in the sweep zone suggested absorption rather than panic selling. Source: TradingView As price rotated between support and supply, structure remained range-bound, not trend-decisive. Liquidation clusters around the lows appeared partially cleared, reducing immediate downside fuel. Still, failure to reclaim $6.40 kept momentum contained, leaving accumulation versus reactive dip-buying unresolved within the current range. THIS overhead supply restrains breakout structure MYX advanced into the $6.20–$6.40 resistance band multiple times, yet each attempt met firm sell-side pressure. Price printed sharp upper wicks near $6.30, reflecting active distribution rather than sustained acceptance. As rallies stalled, pullbacks rotated price toward the $5.16 pivot, preserving range structure instead of breakout continuation. Volume expanded during rejection phases, signaling sellers absorbed upside liquidity rather than exhausting supply. Meanwhile, MACD momentum began flattening after earlier expansion. Source: TradingView Histogram bars compressed toward neutral, indicating slowing upside strength. This alignment suggested momentum cooled as supply dominated overhead. Sell-side absorption remained limited, with supply refilling on each resistance test. For bullish continuation, the price required decisive, high-volume acceptance above $6.40. Until then, the persistent supply overhang continued suppressing upside extension and kept MYX locked within a capped trading range. Decoding MYX’s structural liquidity formation MYX Finance’s Perpetual Volume grew rapidly from very low levels into a steady $250 million to $300 million daily base, signaling strong derivatives adoption. Spikes near $450 million to $500 million appeared at intervals, reflecting short bursts of speculative positioning rather than purely organic flow.

Total Perp Volume reached $70.45 billion in 24 hours, at press time, while 30-day activity exceeded $1.06 trillion, alongside $13.1 billion in Open Interest. Source: DeFiLlama This alignment pointed to broader derivatives market growth, not isolated platform activity. However, stabilization within the mid-range suggested balanced two-way trading rather than strong directional conviction. Sustained turnover reflected regular usage, while periodic spikes highlighted tactical leverage deployment within an expanding liquidity environment. Final Thoughts A break above $6.40 will determine whether the liquidity sweep evolves into a sustained bullish expansion. Sustained perp volume strength positions MYX for volatility expansion once directional conviction returns.28:T1012,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure Ethereum’s price just lost the key support at the $2,000 mark after several weeks of steady downside pressure observed across the crypto market . While the price continues to decline, on-chain data attributes the drop to the ongoing substantial selling pressure from both big and small investors. Big Wallets Turn Bearish On Ethereum With the heightened volatile market conditions, the Ethereum price has seen increased sell-side pressure as investors steadily reduce their exposure. This renewed selling activity is cited among large holders regarded as whales and Sharks. Joao Wedson, a market expert and verified author, reported that whales and sharks are starting to distribute their positions in an aggressive manner. Large holders are gradually reintroducing ETH into circulation, which frequently indicates a decline in conviction or strategic de-risking during erratic market periods. This behavior may have an outsized effect due to the fact that distribution from large wallets increases accessible supply and affects price momentum. Furthermore, the expert stated that the pattern raises the question of whether this is just a movement into cryptocurrency exchange reserves. However, the ideal answer remains no. ETH whales and sharks are in capitulation mode | Source: Chart from Joao Wedson on X Crypto exchanges’ reserves , from recent data, remain relatively stable, which excludes that hypothesis. According to Wedson, this is not an operational transfer, but rather a real selling activity from investors. Currently, entities with substantial ETH holdings are persistently lowering their exposure and putting direct pressure on the altcoin price. In the meantime, the outcome of the current pattern is clear, which includes progressive capitulation, cascading liquidations , and dominant selling pressure. Wedson highlighted that this kind of move does not emerge from retail holders. Rather, it often begins at the top of the structure, with players controlling large volumes. However, when this happens, the market does not let go of the distraction. As a result, the expert has urged holders to protect their capital by seeking alpha signals and not narratives. What Lies Ahead For ETH Beneath The $2,000 Price Level Ethereum losing the $2,000 support level has sparked heightened fear and uncertainty across the market. Prior to the breakdown, Wedson shared an analysis that offers insights into the development and the next direction the altcoin might take. The analysis underscores the significance of the level in Ethereum’s current price performance. In the post on X , Wedson stated that ETH cannot lose the $2,000 because if it does, it is highly likely to increase its bearish performance. This drop is not being triggered by Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, or any other exchange. The expert claims that the decline is being bolstered by the OG holders; these are investors who truly control and have always controlled the market.

Gemini pullbacks, Polygon layoffs, and MicroStrategy pressure flag stress beyond price. Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp freefall in the past 48 hours, scaring retail investors and raising serious concerns over its future viability. Though its price has improved slightly on Friday, traders are bracing themselves for the next big dip– and how much worse it might be. Luckily for the crypto industry, this year wouldn’t be the first time that the future seemed dire. In times like these, history is the best anchor for knowing what happens next, which moves to avoid, and for overall assessing just how bad the situation currently is. Many of these answers lie in the 2022 collapse. The Conditions That Preceded the 2022 Collapse Though a lot has changed since then, the 2022 crypto winter provided the backdrop for what most in the community believed would be the end of the industry. The narrative began in 2020, when, over the course of a year, cryptocurrencies grew enormously. Funding poured into the market, driving prices sharply higher until they peaked around November 2021. During that time, Bitcoin rose from around $8,300 to $64,000 over 10 months. Sponsored Sponsored All Previous Crypto Winters. Source: World Economic Forum High-yield products were central to the allure some of the leading crypto firms offered at the time. The idea of receiving a generous, guaranteed interest rate on purchases such as Bitcoin or stablecoins was highly attractive. Yet, the narrative began to dismantle, partly due to broader macroeconomic factors. The US Federal Reserve had raised interest rates due to persistent inflation, limiting consumers’ access to liquidity. The stock market suffered a deep correction, partially in response to the outbreak of war in Europe. These factors led crypto investors to withdraw funds from the most speculative assets. What ensued was a scenario similar to a bank run. But as consumers rushed to withdraw their funds, bigger issues began to appear– ones that caused investors to seriously distrust the industry. The Domino Effect That Followed The first shock was the collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin in May 2022, when its price nosedived over 24 hours. The event raised serious distrust in its ability to maintain its dollar peg. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Celsius and Voyager Digital, leading centralized exchanges at the time, saw respective outflows of 20% and 14% in customer funds in the 11 days following the news. Then came the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) . At the time, the hedge fund managed about $10 billion in assets. The generalized plunge in crypto prices and a particularly risky trading strategy wiped out its assets, obligating the firm to file for bankruptcy. Withdrawals of customer funds during 90 days before bankruptcy filings. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago . Sponsored Sponsored Centralized exchanges suffered even more greatly, incurring another round of steep outflows. After that came the infamous FTX collapse in November 2022. Outflows reached 37% of customer funds, all of which were withdrawn within 48 hours. According to the Chicago Fed, exchanges Genesis and BlockFi respectively withdrew roughly 21% and 12% of their investments in that month alone. During 2022, at least 15 crypto-related firms ceased operations or entered insolvency proceedings. The failures revealed structural liquidity weaknesses in several business models, particularly their vulnerability to rapid withdrawals during periods of market stress. These events underscored an increasingly important lesson: financial promises must be aligned with underlying liquidity, and contingency planning is essential during periods of stress. Against today’s market backdrop, those lessons have regained renewed relevance . Why Today’s Bitcoin Behavior Matters Over the past week, leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum fell nearly 30% . This drop wiped out an estimated $25 billion in unrealized value across digital asset balance sheets. This data comes as global markets sold off sharply this week, hitting crypto, equities, and even traditional safe havens like gold and silver. The synchronized decline points to a broader liquidity shock rather than asset-specific weaknesses. As a result, traders facing margin calls liquidated their liquid assets first. For crypto, this broader backdrop indicated a market reset rather than a complete loss of confidence. With positive consumer data on Friday reducing near-term macro pressure, Bitcoin saw its price refloat back up to $70,000. Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin’s price over the past week. Source: CoinGecko . Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s behavior has signalled something more structural. It hasn’t exclusively reacted to liquidity conditions. For the past year, Bitcoin has failed to reclaim momentum even on relief rallies. According to previous BeInCrypto analyses, this drawdown is being driven primarily by long-term holders who have consistently sold off their holdings. That behavior sends a powerful negative signal into the market. Newer retailers have followed their moves closely, understanding that when conviction hodlers sell, upside attempts lose credibility. Price action, however, is often only the first visible layer of stress. While markets tend to price fear quickly, institutions respond more slowly and more structurally, adjusting operations long before a full-blown crisis becomes evident. In periods of prolonged uncertainty, these strategic shifts can serve as early warning signs. Institutions Begin Pulling Back Quietly Beyond price movements, early indicators of stress are already emerging at the institutional level. One recent example has been Gemini’s decision to scale back operations and exit certain European markets. The move does not point to insolvency, nor can it be directly attributed to the latest price downturn. Sponsored Sponsored However, it does reflect a strategic adjustment to a higher-compliance environment, illustrating how prolonged uncertainty often prompts institutions to reassess regional exposure and operating efficiency before stress becomes visible in balance sheets or market prices. Meanwhile, last month Polygon carried out a large internal round of layoffs, dismissing roughly 30% of its staff . The move marked the third time it did so in the past three years. Historically, similar operational pullbacks appeared quietly in late 2021 and early 2022, well before broader industry failures became visible. Firms began freezing hiring, scaling back expansion plans, and reducing incentives as liquidity tightened. These moves were often framed as efficiency or regulatory alignment rather than distress. Attention is also returning to digital asset treasuries, where prolonged drawdowns tend to expose balance-sheet sensitivity. MicroStrategy has once again emerged as a bellwether. MicroStrategy Highlights Early Structural Stress Bitcoin’s largest digital asset treasury faced renewed market pressure after Bitcoin slid to $60,000 this week. The event pushed its vast crypto treasury deeper below its average acquisition cost and reigniting concerns about balance-sheet risk. MicroStrategy’s shares fell sharply as Bitcoin extended its sell-off, while the stock’s decline also pushed its market valuation below the value of its underlying Bitcoin holdings . If price volatility persists, such balance sheets will become increasingly reflexive, amplifying both confidence and fragility. In fact, MicroStrategy has already moved away from its once-unmovable promise to never sell. In November, CEO Phong Le acknowledged for the first time that the company could sell its holdings under specific crisis conditions. Today’s indicators appear earlier and more subdued, which may make them easier to overlook. Yet their quiet nature may be precisely what makes them significant, offering a glimpse into how prolonged confidence erosion begins to reshape the industry from the inside out.

Strategy CEO Phong Le told investors on Thursday that the company’s balance sheet remains stable despite recent crypto market turbulence, though extreme scenarios could pose challenges. The firm, the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin (BTC) holder, says it would only need to consider restructuring or additional capital if the cryptocurrency fell to $8,000 and remained there for five to six years. Balance Sheet Holds Amid Bitcoin Sell-Off According to reporting by The Block, Le, speaking during Strategy’s fourth-quarter earnings call, emphasized that even after recent market losses, the company’s Bitcoin reserves comfortably cover its convertible debt. “In the extreme downside, if we were to have a 90% decline in Bitcoin price, and the price was $8,000, that is the point at which our Bitcoin reserve equals our net debt, and we would then look at restructuring, issuing additional equity, issuing additional debt,” he said. The call came after a sharp sell-off across crypto markets, with BTC down roughly 7% in 24 hours, trading just under $66,000 at the time of writing. Strategy’s stock, MSTR, slid 17% to $107, erasing much of its gains from late 2025 and leaving it down about 72% over six months. Analysts on social media noted that today’s session saw Bitcoin drop more than $10,000, the first time it has ever dipped by such an amount in a single day, according to The Kobeissi Letter. The dramatic loss in value was part of a structural market downturn that has wiped out $2.2 trillion in crypto market value since mid-October 2025. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor also spoke in the call, dismissing concerns about quantum computing threats to Bitcoin as “horrible FUD” and outlining plans for a security initiative to support potential upgrades, including quantum resistance. He reiterated that Strategy’s long-term approach is designed to withstand volatility, pointing to supportive U.S. regulatory developments and the growing integration of Bitcoin into credit markets and corporate balance sheets.

Earlier this week, the company acquired 855 BTC for $75.3 million at an average price near $88,000, bringing its total reserves to over 713,500 units. The buy followed a $25 billion accumulation in 2025 and a $1.25 billion purchase in early 2026, funded largely through capital raises. Saylor has argued that the significance of Bitcoin treasury companies lies in credit optionality and institutional adoption rather than daily price action. According to him, firms holding BTC on balance sheets can leverage assets for debt issuance, lending, or financial services, giving them flexibility that ETFs lack. While sentiment has deteriorated sharply in recent months, he framed these developments as part of a long-term integration of digital capital into global financial systems, rather than a short-term price event.

Tags:2b:T1a45,002 Welcome back to Inside DeFi It’s been an especially painful week for crypto markets and DeFi. So bad, in fact, that even the FT was reduced to posting wojaks with the rest of us. With bitcoin dipping below the previous cycle’s peak, and ether (ETH) sub-$2,000, it may feel like there’s not much further to fall. But remember, even when down 99%, there’s still another 99% to go. The bloodbath has also seen DeFi’s TVL drop to under $100 billion for the first time since May last year. Reactions ranged from sober doomerism to gallows humor . Charts aside, InsideDeFi 003 returns to catch up with the week’s goings on. Security scares The week was, despite the ugly backdrop, thankfully light on DeFi hacks, with just two significant incidents. A failed attempt at a third was spotted and publicly mocked on-chain. On Friday, an “arbitrary call vulnerability” in one of Gyroscope’s cross-chain contracts allowed a hacker to grant themself “full allowance to the escrow’s GYD holdings.” Around $700,000 was lost, a third of which Gyroscope later decided to offer to the exploiter as a bounty. A larger attack then hit CrossCurve’s bridge on Sunday. BlockSec put the losses, estimated at $2.7 million, down to an “authorization bypass,” while a post-mortem report from MixBytes claimed $1.4 million. Puzzle Network’s founder has claimed that $700,000 of his own funds were amongst the losses in an on-chain message . In a series of subsequent messages , he continued to request the return of his funds, even offering to buy the exploiter a beer in exchange. According to Spearbit researcher “sujith,” the same attack vector had been previously identified but the report was dismissed as “invalid.” While not a smart contract hack, a significantly larger loss affected the so-called frontpage of Solana, Step Finance, on Friday. Read more: 2025’s biggest crypto hacks: From exchange breaches to DeFi exploits A later update confirmed that approximately $40 million worth of assets were drained from the project’s treasury after executives’ devices were compromised. Almost $5 million was subsequently recovered. MetaMask’s Taylor Monahan implied that the theft was tied to a spate of incidents linked to hijacked Telegram accounts which, she estimates , is responsible for a total of over $300 million of losses, so far. In better news, The DAO’s Griff Green followed up last week’s announcement of a 75,000 ETH security fund with a whitehat operation on a decade-old The DAO contract, rescuing a further 50 ETH to be added to the pot. Read more: The DAO hacked again, but this time it’s the good guys L2s left behind? Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin made a lengthy post on Tuesday, arguing that “the original vision of L2s and their role in Ethereum no longer makes sense, and we need a new path.” He pointed to drastic improvements in mainnet scaling (which are set to continue, 1,000-fold), along with the slow progress on L2 decentralization, as evidence that L2s must offer a specific “value add” to remain relevant. He followed up , underlining that pursuing more “copypasta” EVM L2s and chains is a “dead end” and suggesting that networks offering something specific, such as “privacy, app-specific efficiency [or] ultra-low latency” should be the goal. For all his confidence in Ethereum’s future, reportedly dumping $13 million on-chain definitely didn’t do ETH sentiment any favors. Perhaps waiting to sell until after using a mixer would be preferable in future. Elsewhere in L2 land, a few days before Vitalik’s comments, Base suffered its latest bout of disruption , with “intermittent transaction inclusion delays.” An incident report clarifies that, over a period of two hours and 26 minutes, approximately 80% of transactions (2.1 million) were dropped. The network’s status page registers an outage of 11 minutes on January 31. Transaction inclusion delays were again showing on February 5, leading to a mempool upgrade . Delays are currently ongoing, with improvements including a “transaction propagation redesign” expected to take “four to six weeks.” Read more: Coinbase Base network halts for 44 minutes due to ‘unsafe head delay’ AAVE whale in danger Also on Thursday, all eyes turned to a highly leveraged whale, borrowing $28 million USDC against AAVE tokens. As prices dropped, the position entered dicey territory, which would lead to further pain for AAVE holders if liquidated. Against the backdrop of an ongoing debate over future control of the Aave brand, the assumption the position belonged to Aave founder Stani Kulechov was apparently too tempting for some to resist. Parallels to the DeFi founder playbook of aggressively borrowing stables against their own project’s governance tokens, especially given this week’s news of Kulechov’s purchase of a £22 million London mansion, were hard to miss. However, Kulechov roundly denied the position was him, insisting he stakes his AAVE rather than borrowing against it. Read more: AAVE whale crashes token 10% amid ‘disgraceful’ governance vote Most notably, Curve Finance’s Michael Egorov used this approach long term, whilst buying up a pair of luxury properties in Melbourne. After striking a gentleman’s agreement in the wake of 2023’s Curve hack , Egorov managed to dodge disaster before ultimately being stung in a $20 million liquidation cascade in June 2024. Rune Christensen of Sky (formerly Maker) also uses the same approach, which occasionally leads to its own governance dramas. Kulechov though, with no need to worry about getting liquidated, instead celebrated the protocol’s resiliency at scale, after over $450 million was liquidated this week. Cambodia scam compound crackdown ongoing News out of Cambodia continues to outline the sheer scale of the nationwide crackdown on online “pig butchering” scam syndicates. The widespread disruption has led to over 100,000 foreigners leaving the country since the beginning of the year, according to local media reports , citing the country’s Secretariat of Commission for Combating Technology Crimes. Authorities claim to have shut down 190 locations, including 44 casinos, across the country and made over 2,500 arrests. Additionally, almost 500 people, mostly Chinese and Philippine nationals, have reportedly been deported, though it’s unclear how many of these cases were related to the scamming industry. As well as raids on compounds, the organizations involved have been hit with high profile arrests and executions of leaders in China. The operations are now rumored to be on the move, with Sri Lanka being the next destination. — Jake Harrison2c:T41e,Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to approximately $60,000 before recovering to $69,800, with market dynamics echoing the 2022 FTX collapse. The price drop placed Bitcoin significantly below key on-chain valuation models, such as the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis of $94,000. While social media buzzed with unverified rumors regarding the crash, the primary drivers appear to be measurable market mechanics, including sustained outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs and a massive liquidation cascade.

Data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have suffered over $6 billion in net outflows over the last four months, removing crucial liquidity support from the market. This lack of liquidity, combined with over $1.2 billion in leveraged positions being liquidated, accelerated the sell-off. Furthermore, on-chain analysis reveals significant pain in the market, with daily realized losses hitting $889 million and large holders, or whales, depositing substantial amounts of BTC onto exchanges like Binance, likely preparing to sell or hedge their positions.2d:T22d2,Bitcoin experienced a steep decline over the last 24 hours, pushing its price to approximately $60,000 amid an accelerated selloff comparable to the 2022 FTX collapse. BTC had recovered to $69,800 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate data. Still, Glassnode data helped frame the extent to which the price had slipped relative to widely watched on-chain reference points. With the spot price plunging, the key on-chain price models were far higher, including the STH cost basis at $94,000, the Active Investors Mean at $86,800, and the True Market Mean at $80,100. Bitcoin Realized Price (Source: Glassnode) Meanwhile, the flagship digital asset's realized price sat at $55,600. In light of this, the price move prompted traders to search for a single “smoking gun,” even as the available evidence pointed to a more mechanical unwind. X fills the gap with theories, but little evidence As Bitcoin prices fell rapidly, social media became a clearinghouse for speculation, with narratives moving almost as fast as the price. Traders on X floated multiple explanations for the slide, including rumors of a hidden Hong Kong hedge fund blowup, yen-funding stress, and even quantum security fears. However, those claims share a common problem: they are difficult to verify in real time, and none has been accompanied by publicly documented evidence that would, on its own, explain the size and timing of the move. That does not mean every rumor is false, but the pattern is familiar in fast-moving markets. A sharp liquidation event creates a narrative vacuum, and the internet attempts to fill it, often before the underlying drivers can be measured with any clarity. In light of this, CryptoSlate's more durable explanation for the past 24 hours lies in observable plumbing, ETF flow pressure, forced leveraged positions, and on-chain data showing large holders moving coins onto exchanges. It is less cinematic than a single-surprise catalyst, but it better matches how crypto selloffs tend to propagate once they begin. ETF outflows and a liquidation cascade hit the bid The cleanest, most measurable headwind has been persistent selling via US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Over the past four months, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen net outflows of more than $6 billion, according to SoSo Value data . In practice, such sustained withdrawal matters because it changes who is standing on the other side of the trade. When inflows are strong, the market can lean on a steady, price-insensitive buyer. When outflows persist, that support becomes intermittent, and dips can feel like they have fewer natural bids. James Seyffart , a Bloomberg ETF analyst, noted that Bitcoin ETF holders, in aggregate, are holding their largest losses since the ETFs launched in January 2024, following Bitcoin’s price collapse. He added that the ETFs are experiencing the worst Bitcoin pullback in percentage terms since launch, now at approximately a 42% loss with Bitcoin under $73,000. Bitcoin ETF Cost Basis and Unrealized Loss (Source: Bloomberg) Those figures are not a one-day trigger, but they change the market structure. In a market accustomed to steady ETF demand, sustained outflows reduce the size of the “automatic dip buyer,” making downside breaks more violent when stops and liquidations begin to fire. The selling does not need to be dramatic to matter; it simply needs to be persistent enough to dull rebounds and thin liquidity at key levels. And once the Bitcoin price fell through key levels, forced selling amplified the move. CoinGlass data showed that more than $1.2 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated as Bitcoin sank to record lows. This represented a dynamic that can turn discretionary selling into a mechanical cascade. That sequence is typical in crypto drawdowns. A selloff often begins with risk reduction, then accelerates when exchanges close derivatives positions, regardless of conviction or “fundamentals.” When liquidity is thin, the forced flow can dominate price discovery. It can also make the tape appear to react to hidden information, when the more straightforward explanation is that leverage is being shut down quickly and automatically. On-chain signals show realized losses and whale deposits Meanwhile, blockchain data added a second layer to the story, showing both pain realization and potential supply moving toward venues where it can be sold or hedged. Glassnode data showed that on Feb. 4, Bitcoin’s Entity-Adjusted Realized Loss (7D-SMA) hit $889 million per day, the highest daily loss realization since November 2022. Bitcoin Realized Losses on Feb. 4 (Source: Glassnode) This kind of print typically appears when coins are being sold at a loss at scale, consistent with capitulation dynamics during sharp drawdowns. This is a reminder that the damage in a selloff is not only the headline price move, but also the volume of holders locking in losses as the market trades through levels that had previously served as psychological support. On the other hand, CryptoQuant data pointed to whale behavior on Binance during the sell-off. CryptoSlate Daily Brief Daily signals, zero noise.

According to the firm, the Exchange Whale Ratio (30-day SMA) surged to 0.447, its highest level since March 2025. An elevated whale ratio indicates that the largest inflows make up an unusually large share of deposits, a pattern often associated with whales preparing to sell, hedge, or reposition . Additional CryptoQuant data quantified the scale of those deposits. It reported that total Bitcoin inflows to Binance were approximately 78,500 BTC in early February, with whale inflows of approximately 38,100 BTC, implying that whales accounted for roughly 48.5% of deposits. Bitcoin Whale Transfers to Binance (Source: CryptoQuant) Meanwhile, the above data does not guarantee immediate selling. Large deposits can also precede derivatives hedging, collateral moves, or internal treasury reshuffles. However, in the context of a rapid price break and a liquidation cascade, this reinforces the idea that large players were active on the supply side as liquidity deteriorated. Even the possibility of supply moving toward an exchange can weigh on sentiment when the market is already fragile. Moreover, Santiment data also framed the move as a distribution event among large holders. According to Santiment, wallets holding 10 to 10,000 BTC fell to a nine-month low of 68.04% of total supply after a net reduction of 81,068 BTC over eight days, while “shrimp” wallets holding less than 0.01 BTC rose to a 20-month high of 0.249% of supply. Bitcoin Whales and Shark Sales (Source: Santiment) Taken together, the on-chain picture is consistent with what the tape showed: large holders were active, loss-taking spiked, and smaller buyers were not enough to prevent an air pocket once leverage began to unwind. Retail accumulation can slow a decline at the margin, but it rarely overpowers a market being pushed around by leverage resets and large-holder positioning. Macro risk-off and cross-asset deleveraging tightened liquidity The final leg of the explanation is macro, because Bitcoin has increasingly traded as a liquidity-sensitive risk asset during periods of stress. Reuters linked the broader market mood to an unwind of leveraged and speculative positioning across multiple assets, including crypto, as investors retreated from risk. At the same time, there was a sharp decline in commodities, including gold and silver, during the same window, underscoring that the pressure was not isolated to crypto. When both speculative assets and traditionally “defensive” positions are being sold, liquidity can tighten quickly, particularly if margin requirements rise and funds reduce exposure across portfolios. US equities also contributed to the risk-off tone. Reuters coverage over the week described a tech-led pullback as investors questioned the payoff timeline for heavy AI spending and debated whether AI disruption could compress margins across software and data services. Moreover, fresh labor-market stress signals, including January layoff announcements, which are the highest for the month in 17 years, can feed into a broader repricing of growth and risk. That matters for Bitcoin because macro-driven de-risking tends to hit the most liquid, most reflexive markets first. In this episode, the price action fit that template. ETF outflows weakened the marginal bid, a break in spot prices triggered derivative liquidations, and on-chain data showed loss realization and whale deposits rising amid volatility. The result was a move that looked like a “black swan” on a chart, but behaved like a liquidity event in the plumbing. Mentioned in this article Posted in2e:T9a7,Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has once again torn into Bitcoin’s weak market performance and advised long-term HODLers to abandon ship. He made these comments on X, once again highlighting the digital asset’s poor performance against Gold, an asset he actively promotes. Schiff tweeted : Image Source: X Schiff pointed out that the digital currency has dipped below its November 2021 high of $69k and hasn’t found a reliable floor. He continued the criticism, saying that Bitcoin is down 60% from its 2021 highs against Gold and is dipping even further due to the strong showing of the latter. He also highlighted Michael Saylor’s $54 billion Bitcoin bet and how it is now reporting near double-digit losses after the latest price drop, with no end in sight to this misery. He passionately calls for HODLers to abandon ship and invest elsewhere. Schiff Calls the Death of the Biggest “Financial Mania” in History Schiff continued to lambast Bitcoin in later tweets. He called it the biggest “financial mania” in history and said it was now over, with nothing able to redeem it. He blamed crypto-related liquidations for the recent sharp drop in Silver’s fortunes. He encouraged investors to continue buying silver. Advertisement Schiff’s criticism, while causing further FUD for crypto holders, should be taken with a pinch of salt. He has called the top of Bitcoin on more than 20 occasions, most famously as early as 2013, when Bitcoin hit major milestones at $250 and $1,100. The gold bug reportedly began issuing more frequent “death” calls, arguing it was a speculative bubble similar to “Tulip Mania”. He has continued his rhetoric ever since, and the premier digital currency appreciated more than 120x at one point. Bitcoin is up at least 6000% since he first called it a bubble and predicted its imminent crash. One user pulled out his 2018 tweet that sums it up the best: Image Source: X The premier digital currency is currently trading around $69k at press time and is technically still in free fall. It found some strong support around the $60k psychological level. It is now almost 48% down from its All-Time High (ATH) of $126.5k, but that is still subdued compared to previous crashes. All in all, the 2025 calendar year was a major disappointment for the cryptocurrency sector. However, assets do suffer setbacks from time to time, and it remains to be seen just how effectively Bitcoin can recover from its latest capitulation.2f:Tfec,Key takeaways: Bitcoin's derivatives signal caution, with the options skew hitting 20% as traders fear another wave of fund liquidations. Bitcoin price recovered some of its Thursday losses, but it still struggles to match the gains of gold or tech stocks amid low leverage demand. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has gained 17% since the $60,150 low on Friday, but derivatives metrics suggest caution as demand for upside price exposure near $70,000 remains constrained. Traders fear that the liquidations of $1.8 billion of leveraged bullish futures contracts in five days indicate that major hedge funds or market makers may have blown up. Aggregate liquidations in Bitcoin futures contracts, USD. Source: CoinGlass Unlike the Oct. 10, 2025, market collapse that culminated with a record $4.65 billion liquidation of Bitcoin futures, the recent price weakness has been marked by three consecutive weeks of downside pressure. Bulls have been adding positions between $70,000 and $90,000, as aggregate futures open interest increased despite forceful contract liquidations due to insufficient margins. Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, BTC. Source: CoinGlass The aggregated Bitcoin futures open interest on major exchanges totaled 527,850 BTC on Friday, virtually flat from the prior week. Although the notional value of those contracts dropped to $35.8 billion from $44.3 billion, the 20% change perfectly reflects the 21% Bitcoin price decline in the seven-day period. Data indicates that bulls have been adding positions despite the steady price decline. To better understand if whales and market makers have turned bullish, one should assess the BTC futures basis rate, which measures the price difference relative to regular spot contracts. Under neutral circumstances, the premium should range between 5% and 10% annualized to compensate for the longer settlement period. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.ch The BTC futures basis rate dropped to 2% on Friday, the lowest level in more than a year. The lack of demand for bullish leverage is somewhat expected, but bulls will take longer than users to regain confidence even as Bitcoin price breaks above $70,000, especially considering that BTC is still 44% below its all-time high. Bitcoin derivatives metrics signal extreme fear Traders’ lack of conviction in Bitcoin is also evident in the BTC options markets . Excessive demand for put (sell) options is a strong indicator of bearishness, pushing the skew metric above 6%. Conversely, when fear of missing out kicks in, traders will pay a premium for call (buy) options, causing the skew metric to flip negative. BTC 2-month options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: laevitas.ch The BTC options skew metric reached 20% on Friday, a level that rarely persists and typically represents market panic. For comparison, the skew indicator stood at 11% on Nov. 21, 2025, following a 28% price correction to $80,620 from the $111,177 peak reached twenty days earlier. Since there is no specific catalyst for the current downturn, fear and uncertainty have naturally intensified. Related: What’s really weighing on Bitcoin? Samson Mow breaks it down Traders are likely to continue speculating that a major market maker, exchange, or hedge fund may have gone bankrupt, and this sentiment erodes conviction and implies a high probability of further price downside. Consequently, the odds of sustained bullish momentum remain low while BTC derivatives metrics continue to signal extreme fear. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This declaration came during a heated House Financial Services Committee hearing where Rep. Brad Sherman questioned whether the government could intervene to support BTC prices as they plummeted toward $60,000. Bessent clarified that neither the Treasury Department nor the Financial Stability Oversight Council possesses the power to enforce such measures or modify banking reserve requirements for crypto acquisitions.

Despite ruling out a bailout, Bessent confirmed the government's commitment to expanding its Bitcoin holdings through budget-neutral means, such as utilizing confiscated tokens currently valued at over $15 billion. The administration continues to explore strategies like reevaluating gold certificates or tariff revenue to fund these purchases, potentially creating significant demand and setting a precedent for other nations to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves.31:T90d,U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was recently the subject of heavy scrutiny from lawmakers during a contentious hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, with intense exchanges over various matters, including the Treasury Department’s role in Bitcoin oversight. As the price of BTC craters, Bessent has ruled out the possibility of a government bailout for the premier crypto. “I Do Not Have That Authority” Bitcoin’s crash to nearly $60,000 on Thursday, a roughly 25% decline over seven days, has even U.S. lawmakers wondering whether the government can direct private banks to buy more BTC during a market downturn. “Does the Treasury Department or the various components of the Federal Open Market Committee have the authority to bail out Bitcoin?” anti-crypto California Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) asked Bessent during the hearing. Sherman then asked Bessent if he intends to order private banks to purchase more BTC or “Trump Coin,” a reference to the memecoin launched last January by US President Donald Trump, by modifying banking reserve requirements to allow them to acquire more. Advertisement “I am the Secretary of the Treasury. I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), I do not have that authority.” U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March 2025 to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, made up of tokens forfeited as part of government criminal or civil asset forfeiture. According to Bessent, the $500 million in confiscated Bitcoin had surged in value to over $15 billion while in custody. Government Bitcoin Purchases Remain A Possibility During the hearing, Bessent reiterated that the government remains committed to increasing its Bitcoin holdings in a budget-neutral way without using American taxpayer dollars. However, no major developments were shared on how those strategies may be executed. Among the budget-neutral strategies previously floated are reevaluating the Treasury’s gold certificates and tariff revenue . That said, the US government actively buying Bitcoin could create significant demand for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, which may boost its price and likely signal to other nation-states the need to create their own strategic Bitcoin reserves.32:T7f0,Bitcoin briefly sank toward $60,000 before rebounding above $65,000, after a steep double-digit decline on Thursday that extended a brutal drawdown that has now taken the maiden crypto over 47% below its October 2025 peak. The turbulence has spread across the crypto market, hitting crypto-exposed companies such as Metaplanet, Asia’s largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin. Still, the Tokyo-listed investment and operating firm is not throwing in the towel yet. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich has confirmed that the company is sticking with its Bitcoin accumulation strategy despite the asset’s recent brutal downfall. “[T]here is no change to Metaplanet’s strategy. We will steadily continue to accumulate Bitcoin, expand revenue, and prepare for the next phase of growth,” Gerovich wrote in a translated post on Friday. Metaplanet currently holds 35,102 BTC, the fourth-largest among publicly traded companies, trailing only Michael Saylor’s Strategy, MARA Holdings, and Twenty One Capital. Advertisement Late last month, Metaplanet announced plans to raise up to 21 billion yen ($137 million) via the issuance of new shares and a series of stock acquisition rights to pay down its debt and buy more Bitcoin. Bitcoin Treasuries Face Massive Unrealized Losses Investor fear in the crypto market has surged to a level not seen since the Terra Luna ecosystem crash in mid-2022, following the devastating selloff. Specifically, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has fallen to 9, firmly in “Extreme Fear” territory and at its lowest reading in 42 months since Terra’s implosion— signaling a major breakdown in market confidence. With Bitcoin falling 6.8% over the last 24 hours to a recent price of $65,865, down roughly 20% in the last seven days, Metaplanet is currently sitting on huge losses on its balance sheet. However, like Strategy, Metaplanet has not signaled plans to unwind its exposure or liquidate its Bitcoin holdings. The Gerovich-led company has a target of owning 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027 .33:Tb6c,XRP experienced a sharp decline on Thursday, losing the $1.30 support for the first time in over 15 months amid a broader crypto market downtrend. The sell-off coincided with a major industry milestone: Ripple’s integration of the fast-growing decentralized derivatives exchange (DEX) Hyperliquid into its institutional prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime. Ripple Prime Integrates Hyperliquid Blockchain payments company Ripple has expanded its institutional prime brokerage offering by adding support for Hyperliquid. The Ripple Prime integration allows institutional customers to access on-chain perpetuals liquidity while cross-margining their decentralized finance (DeFi) positions with other asset classes, including crypto such as XRP and Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin RLUSD, foreign exchange, fixed income, over-the-counter swaps, and more, within the same prime brokerage platform. U.S. clients will continue to face Ripple Prime as their sole counterparty. This means that positions across platforms will be managed under a single risk and margin framework inside Ripple Prime. Advertisement “This strategic extension of our prime brokerage platform into DeFi will enhance our clients’ access to liquidity, providing the greater efficiency and innovation that our institutional clients demand,” Ripple Prime International CEO Michael Higgins said in a statement . The integration with Hyperliquid marks Ripple Prime’s “first DeFi venue.” The move comes amid increasing interoperability in the sector. Earlier this year, Flare, a blockchain focused on interoperability, debuted the first XRP spot market on Hyperliquid by listing FXRP for spot trading. Ripple Prime was created following Ripple’s acquisition of crypto-friendly prime broker Hidden Road as part of a $1.25 billion deal disclosed in April 2025 and finalized in October of the same year, combining its regulatory licenses with Hidden Road’s prime brokerage infrastructure. The business, which was rebranded as Ripple Prime, now serves over 300 institutional clients with over $3 trillion cleared across markets, per Ripple’s website. The launch of Ripple Prime arguably extends Ripple’s institutional push beyond payments and custody into a wider set of broker-dealer-like services that big trading companies desire. XRP Slides 16% In Sharp Single-Day Drop According to CoinGecko data , the fintech firm’s XRP token was 16% lower at publication time, trading around $1.25 — representing the weakest performance among major tokens as Bitcoin and Ether plunged 8.1% and 6.9%, respectively. $1.25 marks the lowest price for the cross-border payments asset since November 2024, when it rallied following President Trump’s election victory. Recent positive developments in the XRP ecosystem, including the new institutional decentralized finance (DeFi) access and e-money licenses , failed to light a fire under the bulls.34:Tdd9,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent put a spotlight on the growing rift between regulators and parts of the crypto industry this week, telling lawmakers that those who resist clear rules “should move to El Salvador.” The line landed hard during a Senate Banking Committee hearing and was repeated across multiple news outlets as a sign the administration is pushing for firm oversight rather than tolerance for gray areas in markets. Bessent’s Warning To Industry Based on reports, Bessent called out what he described as a “nihilist” wing of crypto that would rather scuttle compromise than accept a legal framework. His remarks came as senators debated the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, a bill meant to spell out how digital assets fit into existing banking and securities rules. The episode followed recent moves by major players — including a high-profile platform stepping back from support for the bill — which lawmakers say complicates chances for a quick fix. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Image: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images Lawmakers And Lobbyists Take Sides The hearing did not stay polite for long. Voices rose. Accusations flew. Some senators warned that unchecked stablecoin products could pull deposits out of banks, while crypto advocates argued that heavy-handed rules would stifle innovation. Bessent suggested that if firms prefer places with looser oversight they can seek them out, naming El Salvador as an example. That rhetorical nudge is more than a talking point — it’s a signal about market access: do business under US guardrails, or accept limits on participation. BTCUSD currently trading at $65,930. Chart: TradingView What El Salvador Actually Offers Reports note that El Salvador’s crypto stance has shifted since it became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender. Lawmakers there approved changes to make Bitcoin acceptance voluntary as part of an IMF-backed deal last year. The move reduced the mandatory use of Bitcoin while the government said it would still hold and, on occasion, add to its reserves. Those choices mean El Salvador is not a simple “no rules” refuge, even if it appears friendlier to some crypto actors than the US. Markets And Messaging Traders watch words like these. Markets respond to certainty, and clarity tends to calm them. When policymakers argue publicly, volatility can spike. At the same time, a clear path for regulation would let banks plan products and let crypto firms design services that can be sold widely, not just in select jurisdictions. Some industry executives are lobbying for carve-outs; others want full regulatory recognition. The tension is real and it will shape who stays and who sails elsewhere.

On the day, ETH prices fell 14.96%, from $2,148 to $1,826. Crypto market sentiment was in extreme fear. The Fear and Greed index reached 11, a low not seen since 2023. AMBCrypto reported that sub-20 readings on the index represent heightened stress, forced selling, and broad de-risking. The ETH/BTC was at a 3-year low , representing the severe underperformance of the leading altcoin against the leading crypto. The $2k level was at high risk, noted aMBCrypto, and Ethereum has slid below this key psychological level since then. Plotting the ETH path so far Source: ETH/USDT on TradingView On the 1-day chart, the strength of the bears was very evident. In May and June last year, ETH consolidated around $2,500 for a few weeks before catapulting higher in July. In November, the same area was tested as support and saw a bounce. The subsequent retest over the past week saw no noticeable reaction from ETH bulls. The price bulldozed its way below the $2.5k demand zone and also beyond the weekly swing point at $2.1k. The RSI was in oversold territory. The 18.68 daily RSI value on the 5th of January was the lowest since August 2024. The OBV also made a new low, reflecting heavy sell volume. Can THESE zones drag ETH prices higher? The liquidity to the south has been nearly wiped out, showed the 1-month lookback period liquidation heatmap. Zooming out even further, the 1-year heatmap agreed. A massive pocket of liquidations around the $2k price level was taken out during the recent dip. The magnetic zones further south were at $1,500 and lower. Meanwhile, the $2,400 and the $2,700-$2,900 areas had some liquidations that the price could target, showed the 1-month heatmap. Why Traders should sell the bounce The lack of response at the $2.4k demand zone highlighted bearish dominance. A further drop toward $1.5k remains possible, so swing traders looking to catch any ETH bounce should be wary. The $2.1k and $2.4k levels were likely to be revisited in the coming weeks. Traders can be prepared for a bearish reaction at these levels. Final Thoughts Ethereum raced past key demand zones over the past week’s relentless selling pressure. It is possible that ETH would bounce to $2.4k in the coming weeks before its next bearish impulse move.

Long positions at $17.1 million exceed shorts by 60%, increasing downside liquidation risk. Holding $28 keeps bullish structure alive; breakdown risks slide toward $21 support. Hyperliquid has emerged as one of the strongest performers in the crypto market. While Bitcoin is down nearly 28% and Ethereum has fallen around 40%, HYPE is up about 25% over the past month and nearly 10% in seven days. Even in the latest session, the Hyperliquid price has gained close to 3%. However, behind this outperformance, multiple technical and derivatives indicators suggest that the rally may be losing internal strength. Failed breakouts, weakening volume, and rising leverage risks are now putting the sustainability of Hyperliquid’s move under pressure. Sponsored Sponsored Buying Strength Weakens As Sellers Come Back Into Play Despite recent price strength, spot market participation is starting to weaken. On the daily chart, HYPE recently pushed toward the $36 zone but failed to sustain the bull flag breakout. The latest candle printed a long upper wick near this level, showing that sellers stepped in aggressively. This rejection indicates a growing supply (sellers) at higher prices. At the same time, On-Balance Volume (OBV) has been trending lower between January 28 and February 5, even as the price continued moving higher. OBV is a volume-based indicator that tracks buying and selling pressure. Weakening OBV: TradingView Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . This divergence suggests that fewer spot buyers are supporting the rally. In simple terms, price is rising, but real demand is fading. Momentum indicators are flashing similar warnings. Between January 28 and February 4, the Hyperliquid price formed a higher high , while the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, printed a lower high. This bearish divergence, sellers gaining control, was followed by a drop toward $31 before buyers returned. Sponsored Sponsored A similar structure is now forming again. Price is attempting to push higher, but RSI is failing to confirm the move and is shaping another lower high. This divergence is not yet fully confirmed. However, if the next daily candle forms below $36, the pattern would be validated. Bearish Divergence Forming: TradingView When weakening OBV aligns with bearish RSI divergence and repeated rejections near resistance, it often signals that upside momentum is slowing. Derivatives Positioning Is Tilted Heavily Toward Longs While spot buying is weakening, leverage exposure is moving in the opposite direction. Sponsored Sponsored Data from Bybit alone shows that long positions on HYPE perpetual contracts stand near $17.1 million, while short positions remain around $10.7 million. This represents a roughly 60% skew toward longs. Such positioning creates structural vulnerability. When most traders are on the same side, even a small correction can trigger forced liquidations. These liquidations often accelerate selling pressure and turn minor pullbacks into deeper drops. This risk is amplified by the current technical setup. HYPE Liquidation Map: Coinglass If the bearish RSI divergence plays out and price begins slipping below resistance, overleveraged long positions may go out of the picture. Crypto markets have repeatedly shown that long-heavy environments are prone to sudden downside cascades. In Hyperliquid’s case, leverage is rising while momentum weakens, an unstable combination. Sponsored Sponsored Hyperliquid Price Levels To Track Now All technical and derivatives signals now converge around a few critical levels. On the upside, Hyperliquid (HYPE) must first reclaim $37 on a sustained daily closing basis. A clean break above this level would invalidate the current weakness and restore bullish momentum. If $37 is reclaimed, the next resistance sits near $42. Clearing this zone would strengthen the trend and reopen the path toward the $60–$64 region, based on Fibonacci extensions and rally projections. However, downside risks remain significant. The $28 level is now the most important structural support. Hyperliquid Price Analysis: TradingView A daily close below $28 would weaken the bullish structure and likely trigger a broad-based long liquidation, per the HYPE/USDT liquidation map. In that scenario, price could slide quickly toward the $21 region, where deeper support is located. Given the combination of fading volume, bearish momentum signals, and long-heavy positioning, $28 has become the line separating Hyperliquid price continuation from breakdown.

It’s showing up on balance sheets, inside spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and even in how infrastructure gets used when markets turn. This week, Ether’s ( ETH ) slide is leaving treasury-heavy companies nursing massive paper losses, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs are giving a new wave of investors their first real taste of downside volatility. At the same time, extreme weather is reminding miners that hash rate still depends on power grids, and a former crypto miner-turned-AI darling shows how yesterday’s mining infrastructure has quietly become today’s AI backbone. This week’s Crypto Biz newsletter breaks down BitMine Immersion Technologies’ widening paper losses, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investors slipping underwater and the impact of a US winter storm on public miner production. BitMine’s ETH paper losses widen BitMine Immersion Technologies, chaired by Tom Lee, is facing mounting paper losses on its Ether-heavy treasury as ETH slid below $2,200 during the latest crypto sell-off. The decline has pushed the company’s unrealized losses past $7 billion, underscoring the risks tied to balance sheets built around volatile digital assets. BitMine currently holds about $9.1 billion worth of Ether, including a recent purchase of 40,302 ETH, leaving the company highly exposed to further price swings. While the losses remain unrealized unless assets are sold, they highlight the fragility of crypto treasury strategies when markets turn lower. Lee has pushed back on the criticism, arguing that unrealized losses are inherent to ETH-holding companies. “BitMine is designed to track the price of ETH,” he said, adding that in a downturn, ETH weakness is to be expected. Source: Dropslab BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holders slip underwater As Bitcoin crashed below $80,000, aggregate returns for investors in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) turned negative, highlighting the depth of the recent selloff and its impact on investor portfolios. According to Unlimited Funds chief investment officer Bob Elliott, the average dollar invested in IBIT is now underwater. Bitcoin has since extended its decline below $75,000, adding further pressure to returns. IBIT was one of BlackRock’s most successful ETF launches, becoming the asset manager’s fastest fund to reach $70 billion in assets . Those investors are now getting a firsthand lesson in Bitcoin’s volatility, especially when price action moves decisively to the downside. Source: Bob Elliott US winter storm slams Bitcoin production A powerful winter storm sweeping across the US in late January forced Bitcoin miners to sharply curtail production , underscoring how sensitive mining remains to energy grid stress during extreme weather. New data from CryptoQuant shows daily output from public miners averaged about 70 to 90 BTC before the storm, then plunged to just 30 to 40 BTC at the height of the disruption. The drop was abrupt, reflecting widespread shutdowns as miners reduced load or went offline to avoid strain on local power grids. The slowdown proved temporary. As weather conditions improved, production began to recover, highlighting the flexibility miners retain but also the volatility introduced by grid-dependent operations. The CryptoQuant data tracks publicly listed miners, including CleanSpark, MARA Holdings, Bitfarms and Iris Energy, offering a snapshot of how large-scale US mining operations respond when power becomes scarce. Source: Julio Moreno CoreWeave shows how crypto infrastructure became AI’s data center backbone CoreWeave’s evolution from crypto miner to AI infrastructure provider offers a clear example of how mining-era hardware is being repurposed for the AI boom, highlighting how computing resources migrate across technology cycles. According to The Miner Mag, Ethereum’s shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake sharply reduced demand for GPU-based mining, pushing CoreWeave and similar operators to pivot toward AI and high-performance computing. While CoreWeave no longer operates as a crypto company, its transition has become a blueprint for other miners exploring diversification, including HIVE Digital, Hut 8 and MARA Holdings. CoreWeave’s pivot gained new prominence after Nvidia agreed to a $2 billion equity investment in the company, reinforcing the idea that infrastructure built for crypto mining is now forming a critical layer of AI’s data center backbone.

Key takeaways Current crypto price levels are significantly lower compared to previous highs. The resilience of risk assets will dictate future crypto market performance. Bitcoin’s divergence from gold is causing market instability. Bitcoin is experiencing downward trends while other risk assets rise. The market is currently driven by capital flows rather than fundamental catalysts. Quantum computing concerns are impacting Bitcoin’s appeal to institutional investors. The crypto market is expected to remain range-bound this year. Market structure is healthier now due to less leverage and unsecured credit. The market is consolidating due to over-leverage and speculative fervor. Capital is expected to return to crypto when other speculative assets lose appeal. Crypto is increasingly seen as one of many asset classes. Retail investors are significantly influencing asset prices across classes. Retail interest in Bitcoin is expected to return, driving price movements. The current market is characterized by recycled capital rather than new retail investment. Increased investor activism in crypto companies is likely as they explore real-world assets. Guest intro Joshua Lim serves as Global Co-Head of Markets at FalconX. He co-founded crypto derivatives trading firm Arbelos Markets, which was acquired by FalconX in 2025. Previously, he led derivatives trading at Genesis Trading and Galaxy Digital after starting in equity derivatives at Goldman Sachs. Historical price movements and market dynamics “The current price levels in crypto markets reflect a significant regression compared to previous highs.” – Joshua Lim “These levels are obviously distressing for anyone who’s worked in the industry for quite some time.” – Joshua Lim The future performance of crypto markets will depend on the resilience of risk assets. “It’s entirely gonna be a function of how well risk assets can hold up.” – Joshua Lim The divergence between Bitcoin and gold is causing instability in the crypto market. “This very large divergence and in particular, the most stark divergence is between Bitcoin and gold.” – Joshua Lim Bitcoin is currently experiencing downward price movement while other risk assets are trending upwards. “Bitcoin is the only chart that’s pointing downwards while everything else is up into the right.” – Joshua Lim The current market for Bitcoin is driven by flows rather than fundamental catalysts. “It’s really very much a flows driven market and what we’re seeing is like the flows… flowing into more established asset classes in particular with gold.” – Joshua Lim Institutional concerns and market forecasts The quantum question poses a significant concern for Bitcoin, affecting its attractiveness to institutional investors compared to gold. “It’s the quantum question and that narrative… is an overhang.” – Joshua Lim The crypto market is expected to remain in a prolonged range-bound state this year. “I do think that we’re gonna be on a prolonged range-bound market.” – Joshua Lim The current market structure is healthier due to the absence of gross overextensions of leverage or unsecured credit. “Market structure is a lot healthier this time around.” – Joshua Lim The current market is experiencing a consolidation phase due to over-leverage and speculative fervor. “The market got a little bit over-leveraged and there was a little bit too much speculative fervor.” – Joshua Lim Capital will eventually return to crypto as speculative assets like stocks and commodities lose their appeal. “I think at some point all of that money will come back to crypto.” – Joshua Lim Perception of crypto as an asset class Crypto is increasingly viewed as just another option among various asset classes rather than a standalone market. “It feels like crypto is just part of the wider markets.” – Joshua Lim Gold and silver have experienced significant price movements, indicating a potential blow-off top. “We had pretty drastic moves 30% plus move in silver 15% and plus in gold.” – Joshua Lim The retail investor is significantly influencing asset prices across various classes. “What it does show is just how much like the retail impulse is driving asset classes these days.” – Joshua Lim Retail interest in Bitcoin will return, leading to significant price movements. “I think once the sort of retail mindset comes back and focuses on Bitcoin you’ll see stuff like that again.” – Joshua Lim The current crypto market is characterized by recycled capital rather than new retail investment. “A lot of that money that’s coming from one token to another in crypto is just recycled crypto native capital.” – Joshua Lim Investment vehicles and market dynamics The proliferation of investment vehicles in crypto has diluted attention and made it difficult for any single asset to attract

winners despite current market conditions. “It’s not inevitable that a lot of these will trade below nav forever…there’s gonna be strong winners.” – Joshua Lim There will likely be increased investor activism in crypto-related companies as they explore real-world assets and share buybacks. “I think we’d get a lot of lead time before that would like before that really materializes.” – Joshua Lim

token holders. “It’s on the order of like $4,000,000 of revenue per day.” – Joshua Lim DeFi is on the cusp of competing head-to-head with centralized exchanges. “It sort of looks like that we’re almost at some kind of inflection point where DeFi is really competing head to head with centralized exchanges.” – Joshua Lim The rise of platforms like Hyperliquid may lead to a dispersion of trading volumes from centralized exchanges to more regulated venues. “With the rise of Hyperliquid… you can kinda have some idea that maybe a lot of those volumes that were concentrated there will get dispersed.” – Joshua Lim There is a growing demand for transparency and accountability in crypto markets. “I think we’re starting to see like more a greater demand for transparency for accountability.” – Joshua Lim Technological advancements and future trends The rise of AI-driven commerce will benefit internet-native value transfer mechanisms, particularly privacy-oriented transactions. “I do think it’ll probably benefits to double coins the most.” – Joshua Lim The development of privacy-enabled chains that comply with regulations is a crucial area for innovation. “I

Ad Disclosure Bitcoin (BTC) has staged a modest rebound after suffering a sharp sell‑off over recent days, but market analysts warn that the underlying pressures driving the decline remain firmly in place. The world’s largest cryptocurrency plummeted momentarily to around $60,000 on Thursday, its lowest level in around 17 months, before rising modestly to current trade values of $70,667 as of Friday afternoon. Crypto Winter Fears Grow In comments shared with Fortune, Jefferies analyst Andrew Moss, the downturn is being fueled largely by selling from major holders. In a note to clients, Moss said that large Bitcoin investors, commonly referred to as whales, have been offloading their positions into market weakness. He noted that these holders shifted to net sellers over the weekend after steadily accumulating Bitcoin since early January, suggesting a significant change in market behavior at the top end of ownership. BTC whale activity during January. Source: Fortune Selling pressure has also emerged from retail investors who gained exposure to Bitcoin through spot exchange‑traded funds (ETFs). Moss pointed out that net outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs during the weeks of January 19 and January 26 ranked as the second‑ and third‑largest since those products were launched. Those withdrawals were followed by another wave of substantial outflows on February 4, adding to downward pressure on prices, which coupled with ETF outflows, has reignited familiar concerns across the crypto market. Moss said renewed talk of a “ Crypto Winter ” is spreading, warning that there are few convincing signs that Bitcoin is nearing a bottom. He added that the lack of buying activity from small‑ and medium‑sized holders suggests that dip‑buying sentiment remains weak, a factor that often signals further downside risk. Analysts Divided On Bitcoin’s Next Move Other analysts echoed the cautious outlook. Deutsche Bank strategist Henry Allen noted that Bitcoin’s recent drop marked its worst single‑day decline since November 2022. That period coincided with the collapse of Sam Bankman‑Fried’s FTX exchange , an event that wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds and sent shockwaves through the digital asset industry. Chevy Cassar, author of the Milk Road newsletter, described the current environment in stark terms, acknowledging that the downturn is painful and warning that conditions could deteriorate further. Based on historical patterns, Cassar said crypto markets often take anywhere from one month to nearly a year to reach a true bottom after major declines. Still, not all observers see the current moment as purely negative. Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at Sygnum Bank, said the market may be approaching a point of exhaustion . Dori said sentiment appears to be entering what he described as “peak fear territory,” a phase that has historically preceded stabilization or recovery in past cycles.

The rebound followed a violent sell-off earlier in the week that saw Bitcoin briefly dip to around $60,000 , its lowest level in months, before buyers stepped back in. At the time of writing, BTC had climbed to approximately $70,300 , marking a 12% daily rebound from intraday lows. The move helped arrest broader market weakness and restore short-term confidence after widespread liquidation-driven selling. Bitcoin reclaims key level after flush to $60,000 The price action suggests a classic relief bounce following capitulation-like conditions. TradingView data shows Bitcoin printed a long lower wick near the $60,000–$62,000 zone before reversing higher, accompanied by a sharp pickup in volume. Source: TradingView Momentum indicators reflected oversold conditions before the rebound. Bitcoin’s RSI dipped into the low 30s , a level historically associated with short-term exhaustion during corrective phases rather than long-term trend reversals. While Bitcoin remains well below its late-2025 highs, reclaiming the $70,000 handle has helped calm near-term downside fears. Market-wide recovery follows Bitcoin’s lead The stabilization in Bitcoin quickly fed through to the rest of the market. A crypto market heatmap snapshot from 6 February showed broad gains across large-cap assets: Ethereum rose more than 7% Solana gained over 6% BNB climbed close to 3% Several mid- and large-cap altcoins posted high single- to double-digit rebounds The synchronized move suggests the recovery was driven by a shift in market-wide positioning rather than asset-specific catalysts. Stablecoins, including USDT, remained largely flat, suggesting capital was rotating back into risk rather than into fresh inflows. Source: TradingView Cycle indicators point to relief rally, not market top On-chain and cycle indicators remain subdued relative to historical market peaks. The Puell Multiple , a measure of miner revenue stress, sits near 0.71 , a level typically associated with undervaluation rather than overheating. Meanwhile, Pi Cycle Top indicators remain inactive, with key moving averages still far apart — a sign that the market is not exhibiting late-cycle behavior. Together, these signals suggest the rebound reflects short-term stabilization after forced selling, rather than the start of a new euphoric phase. What this rebound means for the market Bitcoin’s recovery has temporarily restored balance after a sharp deleveraging event, easing immediate downside pressure across crypto markets. However, volatility remains elevated, and prices are still well below recent highs. For now, the rebound reflects position resets and short-covering, not a decisive trend reversal. Sustained upside requires confirmation through follow-through buying, improving macro conditions, or renewed institutional inflows. Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s rebound above $70,000 has steadied crypto markets after a sharp liquidation-driven sell-off. While the recovery has lifted sentiment, indicators suggest a relief rally rather than a confirmed shift back to sustained bullish momentum.3b:Ta6a,After a massive V-shaped recovery from its flash crash to $60,000, one of the world's largest asset managers has indicated that the bottom might be in. Jurrien Timmer, the director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, has publicly identified the mid-$60k range as a critical buy zone. The key price point The broader market was fixated on macro headlines last week, but Timmer kept his eye on Bitcoin's technicals. Despite the fear that gripped the market earlier today, he reaffirmed his conviction in the asset's price floor. HOT Stories "The markets spoke loudly last week to the next Fed Chair being announced," Timmer wrote. "For Bitcoin, though, I continue to view $65k as an attractive entry point." Gold will keep outperforming Bitcoin Timmer also addressed the "elephant in the room", which is the fact that gold has recently outperformed its digital counterpart. Gold has surged to new all-time highs due to central bank buying and geopolitical fear. Timmer attributes this lag to technical positioning rather than a fundamental failure of Bitcoin. You Might Also Like "Given the distance between gold and Bitcoin vis-à-vis their support levels," Timmer explained, "I suspect that gold will continue to outpace Bitcoin until the flows converge further." Timmer shared what he described as a "somewhat cosmic-looking chart" tracking commodities and bonds since the cyclical bull market began in October 2022. The data highlights a stark reality for traditional 60/40 portfolios: long-term bonds are failing to protect investors, while "hard assets" are soaring. "In my view, commodities (including precious metals) continue to serve as important diversifiers in this era of fiscal dominance, regardless of who finances the debt and how," Timmer stated. He noted that precious metals have "quickly... risen in the ranks despite their very low correlation" to the S&P 500, effectively taking market share from Bitcoin in recent months. In contrast, long bonds remain "dead last," warning that if bonds become positively correlated with stocks again, investors will desperately need "uncorrelated assets (including alts) to navigate risks." 18 years vs. 5 millennia In a chart comparing the inflation-adjusted market capitalizations of monetary assets, he noted that gold currently sits at roughly $35 trillion, while Silver and Bitcoin are tied at approximately $1.8 trillion. The speed at which Bitcoin reached that milestone, however, is unprecedented in human history. "It’s amazing to me that it took Bitcoin 18 years to reach a market cap of $1.8 trillion; it took silver five millennia," Timmer observed. "Apples to oranges of course, but still."3c:Ta73,Proponents of AI agents say the new technology will simplify crypto trading and other financial activities for the average user. AI platform ai.com, founded by Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek, announced on Friday that it will be launching an autonomous AI agent for retail consumers. The agentic AI will be able to execute functions including trading stocks, workflow automation and simple tasks like calendar updates and managing changes to online social profiles, according to an announcement from the company. The agents will feature segregated user data, secured by encryption keys unique to each user, and run according to user-set restrictions on what the agent is allowed to do, the announcement said. AI agents have garnered significant attention from users over the last year. About one quarter (23%) of respondents surveyed by investment research firm McKinsey indicated that their organizations were expanding the use of AI agents, according to a November report from the company. A survey tracking agentic AI usage in organizations. Source: McKinsey & Company The growth of autonomous AI agents can automate crypto trading strategies and wallet management, removing the technical barrier-to-entry for new users unfamiliar with blockchain systems and onchain transaction execution, proponents of the technology say. Related: Crypto dev launches website for agentic AI to ‘rent a human’ How agentic AI can remove the barrier to entry for cryptocurrencies and Web3 These technical barriers include choosing the correct blockchain network and token protocols to send funds to, and complex user interfaces that are harder to navigate for new users, according to Jonathan Farnell, CEO of crypto exchange Freedx. Agentic AI can abstract away the technical complexity of cryptocurrencies by selecting the cheapest and fastest execution pathways and simplifying stablecoin usage , according to Tether co-founder Reeve Collins. This can include optimization for arbitrage or yield-bearing opportunities, Collins told Cointelegraph. “When AI is integrated, all of the complexity in this space will be gone,” Collins said, adding that autonomous AI agents will allow users to hold and navigate larger portfolios of increasingly diverse token standards.

Feb 6, 2026, 8:15 p.m. Shares of Galaxy Digital (GLXY) jumped 18% to $19.90 on Friday after the company approved a share repurchase program of up to $200 million, giving it authority to buy back its Class A common stock over the next 12 months. The buybacks may be executed through the open market, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, including trading plans under Rule 10b5-1, the company said. Galaxy added that it retains the right to suspend or discontinue the program at any time, depending on market conditions and other factors. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The announcement signaled confidence from management that Galaxy’s shares are undervalued and that the firm has excess capital to deploy. Share repurchase programs often support stock prices by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which can boost earnings per share and signal balance-sheet strength. In volatile markets, buybacks can also reassure investors that management believes the company’s fundamentals remain intact. “We are entering 2026 from a position of strength, with a strong balance sheet and continued investment in Galaxy’s growth,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy. “That foundation gives us the flexibility to return capital to shareholders when we believe our stock doesn’t reflect the value of the business.” The sharp move higher reflects investor approval of that message. Galaxy reported fourth-quarter earnings earlier this week that initially weighed on the stock. The company posted a net loss of $482 million for the quarter, sending shares down initially. Despite the quarterly loss, Galaxy said it generated $426 million in adjusted gross profit for the full year and ended the year with $2.6 billion in cash and stablecoins, underscoring its liquidity position.

Zeng Ying, otherwise known as Ten Ten, started making accusations against Sun last weekend, accusing him of manipulating the price of TRX with Binance accounts wash trading on his behalf, and also directing crypto accounts to spread misinformation about her. Her latest post appears to reveal a message she received from Sun, in which he admits that he’s known her for many years and shared “ very personal ” experiences with her. In the alleged message, translated using Google, he tells Ten Ten that the two can “cherish” and “express” these experiences, but that they “shouldn’t become the subject of gossip.” Protos used Google translate to convert Ten Ten’s image into English. Read more: Justin Sun’s alleged ex accuses him of market manipulation, insider trading “They are precious to us, but to onlookers, they are just something to amuse themselves and will soon pass.” He additionally downplays her accusations as “online speculations and rumors,” and tells her that “Believing these rumors and harming your own health is the worst possible outcome.” “I know you have something to say, but why not write it down and send it to me?” he asks. “Many things, when said aloud, might just be seen as a joke by others, but in the end, you’re often the one who gets hurt the most.” In the message, Sun apparently also asks Ten Ten to delete some articles and replace them with different text . However, the screenshot shared online doesn’t reveal what specific text this would be. When sharing the message, Ten Ten said, “So you bought all those water army accounts to smear me, all to help me strengthen my body and build fitness, huh?” Justin Sun denies all of Ten Ten’s claims Sun claimed yesterday that “rumors regarding an ‘ex-girlfriend’ and our compliance status are unequivocally false.” He claims that his firm “cooperates fully with global judicial and law enforcement agencies to crack down on embezzlement, fraud, hacking, other forms of cybercrime, to protect our users’ lawful assets.” Ten Ten posted minutes later that, “Sun finally got hard for once — he never really got hard when we were together before. I’ll send the full verdict later.” This post was later deleted.

GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound anchor the launch, with prices cut by as much as 85–93% from U.S. list prices under a most-favored-nation framework. Supporters hail the platform as a breakthrough on affordability, while critics argue it benefits a narrow slice of patients and sidesteps deeper reforms to insurance and drug pricing. TrumpRx.gov , a government-backed platform aimed at slashing U.S. prescription drug prices by tying them to the lowest rates paid in other developed countries, launched late Thursday. The site, branded as a “ most-favored-nation ” pricing tool, is positioned as a clearinghouse to help users find the best pricing for prescription drugs. Users can search for medications, see sharply discounted cash prices, generate printable or digital coupons, and are then routed to participating manufacturers or pharmacies to complete purchases. No insurance is required, and no account is needed. The White House has billed TrumpRx as a transparency play designed to bypass middlemen—pharmacy benefit managers, insurers, and opaque rebate structures that have long distorted U.S. drug pricing. At launch, the platform lists more than 40 branded drugs from major pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, with additional medications promised in the coming months. The rollout focused heavily on GLP-1 agonists , the blockbuster drugs used to treat diabetes and obesity that have become a flashpoint in the broader healthcare affordability debate. Monthly list prices for these drugs often exceed $1,000 in the U.S., far higher than prices in Europe or Asia. Via the TrumpRx portal, those numbers drop sharply for cash-paying users, based on coupons offered by pharma companies: Ozempic (semaglutide for diabetes) is listed as low as $199 per month , down from roughly $1,028. Wegovy (semaglutide for obesity) starts at $199 per month for injectable pens, down from $1,349, while the newly approved pill version is listed starting at $149 per month . Zepbound (tirzepatide) from Eli Lilly appears at $299–$346 per month , compared with list prices exceeding $1,000. Trump called the cuts—up to 85-93% on certain doses—historic, framing them as the product of direct negotiations with drugmakers and proof that aggressive federal leverage can break what he described as entrenched price-gouging by pharmaceutical giants. "It's the biggest thing to happen in health care, I think, in many, many decades," he said at the White House announcement Thursday. At the event, the administration highlighted other steep discounts, including asthma inhalers from AstraZeneca dropping from $458 to $51. A military spouse spoke about how lower drug prices could reshape family planning and long-term health decisions. Supporters quickly seized on the announcement as a political and cultural win. Conservative media and pro-Trump accounts on social media circulated screenshots of TrumpRx price listings and launch videos, framing the platform as a rare, tangible intervention in an area where Americans routinely feel powerless. The emphasis on GLP-1 drugs—now entangled with conversations about obesity, productivity, and healthcare access—gave the rollout broader resonance beyond traditional partisan lines. But critics were equally quick to puncture the narrative. So there it is: they killed the ACA because this loon wanted to launch a scam with HIS name: trump Rx. Millions of Americans losing their Healthcare because of his greed and his ego. pic.twitter.com/l8NBa8ALTJ — BrooklynDad_Defiant!☮️ (@mmpadellan) December 18, 2025 Health policy experts and Democratic lawmakers have argued that TrumpRx targets a relatively narrow slice of the market: uninsured patients or those paying cash. Most Americans, they noted, rely on insurance plans where copays and negotiated rates may already undercut—or complicate—the TrumpRx pricing. Others pointed out that similar self-pay discounts for some GLP-1 drugs already exist through private platforms like GoodRx, raising questions about how much of the “savings” represent genuinely new price reductions versus repackaged existing deals with "Trump" branding. Skeptics also challenged the headline percentage cuts, noting that list prices themselves are inflated artifacts of the U.S. rebate system. In that context, a dramatic discount can still leave patients paying more than international peers—and can obscure who ultimately absorbs the cost difference. On social media and in policy circles, detractors labeled TrumpRx a “gimmick” or a politically timed workaround that avoids deeper reforms to patent law, pharmacy benefit manager incentives, and insurance design. There are also unanswered questions about sustainability. TrumpRx relies on voluntary manufacturer participation and negotiated pricing, rather than statutory caps. Whether drugmakers continue offering steep discounts once the political spotlight fades—or expand them beyond a curated list of high-profile drugs—remains unclear. Still, the platform represents a notable escalation in the federal government’s willingness to directly intervene in drug pricing optics, if not yet the underlying system. For millions of Americans managing chronic conditions without insurance—or priced out of coverage—TrumpRx could provide real, immediate relief. For everyone else, it reopens a familiar question in U.S. healthcare: When prices finally fall, who is actually paying the difference—and who decides how long the discounts last?

Its price hit a low of $60,000 on Coinbase late on Thursday, falling by over 50% from its peak of $126,000 in early October. CoinEx Research chief analyst Jeff Ko told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s drawdown comes alongside a selloff in US tech stocks, “where stretched valuations and lingering concerns around an artificial intelligence-driven bubble have long been highlighted by the market.” Polymarket, Circle partner to move prediction market to native USDC settlement Decentralized prediction market Polymarket has partnered with stablecoin issuer Circle to transition its platform to native USDC ( USDC ) settlement, replacing the bridged USDC.e currently used on Polygon. The move will see Polymarket shift away from bridge-based settlement infrastructure toward Circle-issued USDC, which is fully backed and redeemable for US dollars. According to the companies, the change is intended to reduce the complexity and risk associated with cross-chain bridges while improving capital efficiency. Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan said the transition supports a consistent, dollar-denominated settlement standard as the platform scales. The partnership reflects a broader trend in crypto toward native stablecoin settlement as onchain markets mature and infrastructure providers prioritize security and regulatory alignment.

The crash was prompted by a plethora of factors. Market watchers say Bitcoin’s selloff over the past three months is unprecedented. Bitcoin jumped back above the $70,000 mark on Friday as investors piled back into the asset class following a volatile week for the cryptocurrency market at large. The $1.3 trillion digital asset is up over 6% today after plunging to nearly $60,000 earlier on Thursday. Ether has jumped more than 7% to above $2,000 while XRP trades at $1.46, up nearly 20%. Market watchers say the worst is over. “While it is difficult to say, conditions appear to be aligning for crypto to bottom,” David Duong, global head of investment research at Coinbase, told DL News. Bitcoin’s crash was brought on by a combination of factors: collapsing leverage, miners forced to sell, AI hype unravelling, quantum computing risks, and the typical four-year boom-bust cycle patterns that Bitcoin investors expect and sell into. Investors grappling with Bitcoin’s volatility quickly began to bemoan a bear market, with some experts saying crypto markets could get thrashed even more. Selloff across the board The downturn wasn’t exclusive to Bitcoin, however. Duong added that gold and silver also got battered in trading this week, as did tech equities across the board. After a tremendous run that took silver to $118 from $74 in January, the precious metal dropped nearly 40% in the past week. Gold, which towered to a fresh price record of $5,500, also pulled back this week, dropping about 13%. Both have since bounced back. Tech equities, which typically move in tandem with Bitcoin as “risk on” assets, also jumped. The Nasdaq was up 2% on Friday. Amid Bitcoin’s decline came President Trump’s announcement for the new Federal Reserve chair: Kevin Warsh . Warsh, who served as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, has made pro-crypto statements in the past. And despite Warsh previously claiming that interest rates need to be lower, his history as an inflation hawk has spooked investors. “A combination of factors has weighed on sentiment — from Warsh’s appointment as Fed chair to mixed results from tech earnings,” Duong told DL News . Bitcoin making history Experts reckon this week’s Bitcoin crash was an outlier. “The current price action is not just painful; it is unprecedented,” crypto options exchange Deribit’s chief commercial officer Jean-David Peiquignot told DL News . “For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, the market is on track for a third consecutive monthly decline.” Bitcoin’s swift drop — last week it was trading at nearly $83,000 — came as highly leveraged traders got liquidated. In fact, over $2.65 billion in futures positions were closed yesterday, according to CoinGlass data. Peiquignot continued that the number of liquidations this week means that the bottom should be in, although left the door open for more unexpected “macro catalysts” that could lead to more pain. Bitcoin has been grappling with increased volatility since October 10 — the biggest liquidation event in the history of crypto — when over $19 billion in digital asset bets were liquidated.

In a company announcement on Friday, the South Korean crypto exchange said the price dislocation occurred after some recipients sold the mistakenly credited Bitcoin, but that it quickly restricted the affected accounts through internal controls, allowing market prices to stabilize within minutes and preventing any chain liquidations. Bithumb said the incident was unrelated to any hacking or security breach and did not result in losses to customer assets, adding that trading, deposits and withdrawals are operating normally. The company said that customer funds remain safely managed and that it will transparently disclose follow-up actions to prevent similar errors. While Bithumb did not disclose the amount involved, several users on X claimed that some accounts were erroneously credited with roughly 2,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ), a claim that has not been independently verified. Source: Scott Melker The news comes after Bithumb said in January that it had identified roughly $200 million in dormant customer assets spread across 2.6 million accounts that had been inactive for more than a year, as part of a recovery campaign. According to CoinGecko, Bithumb currently carries a trust score of 7 out of 10 and reported roughly $2.2 billion in 24-hour trading volume at the time of writing. Related: Bithumb halves crypto lending leverage, slashes loan limits by 80%: Report Operational issues at centralized cryptocurrency exchanges Beyond price volatility, the past year has exposed operational challenges at centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that have affected users during routine activity and periods of market stress. In June, Coinbase acknowledged that restrictions on user accounts had been a major issue for the exchange, and claimed it had reduced unnecessary account freezes by 82% following upgrades to the exchange’s machine-learning models and internal infrastructure. The disclosure followed years of complaints from users who reported being locked out of their accounts for months, sometimes during periods of heightened market volatility, even when no security breach or external attack had occurred. During the Oct. 10 market sell-off that triggered billions of dollars in liquidations, Binance faced user complaints that technical issues prevented some traders from exiting positions at peak volatility. Although Binance said its core trading infrastructure remained operational, and attributed the liquidations primarily to broader market conditions rather than internal failures, the exchange later distributed about $728 million in compensation to users affected by the disruptions.

The breakout, following a period of consolidation, marked the end of the bear trend. The MACD bullish cross confirmed the shift, and the market rallied behind MemeCore. But what fueled this rally or reversal? Short liquidations add fuel to MemeCore’s rally A key ingredient in MemeCore ’s rally was the liquidations. Bears who thought they could cash in on a breakdown were caught off guard, and they paid the price. Short liquidations, an all-too-familiar catalyst in crypto, fueled the fire. Source: CoinGlass With each liquidation, the buying pressure surged, pushing the price even higher. These forced exits meant bears were trapped, and bulls took full advantage, pressing the market higher. It was the perfect storm for the bears, and they weren’t ready for it. Increased market confidence in M MemeCore [M] wasn’t just catching short sellers off guard; it was building momentum. OI, a key indicator of market confidence, rose alongside both increasing volume and a rising price.

Being part of this exclusive list meant more visibility, more market awareness, and potentially more investor confidence. MemeCore was officially on the map, and its rise was just beginning. $2.5 marks next key target With the rally in full swing, attention has now turned to the $2.5 level. If MemeCore manages to break through this resistance, there could be significant upside potential. The $2.5 level is a crucial barrier. After breaking the upper line of the symmetrical triangle, it will need to clear the smaller resistance at $1.7 on the lower timeframes before challenging the major resistance. While the path to $2.5 is still open, the next step hinges on MemeCore continuing to liquidate short positions and sustaining market confidence. The key question remains: can the bulls maintain their momentum? Final Thoughts MemeCore’s 15% rise signals a strong reversal and potential for continued upward movement. Short liquidations and rising OI suggest the rally has more room to run, with $2.5 as the next key target.44:Tec8,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure The XRP Ledger quietly crossed an important milestone this week . After weeks of waiting, the Permissioned Domains amendment has finally gone live. Validators reached the required 80% yes vote back in January, but as protocol rules demand, that consensus had to hold for two consecutive weeks before activation. On February 4, the waiting period ended, and the amendment officially became part of the XRP Ledger with a 91.19% approval. The moment passed with little noise, but investors might have missed its implications, which extend far deeper than a routine technical update. Quiet Upgrade Changes How Institutions Can Use The XRP Ledger Permissioned domains were introduced to the XRP Ledger on the v2.4.0 update. The rollout followed the standard governance process on the Ledger, which requires both a supermajority vote and sustained agreement over time to prevent rushed or unstable changes. In this case, validators voted yes early, locking in more than 80% approval in January. According to Stern Drew , an XRP analyst on the social media platform X, the importance of Permissioned Domains lies in how they reshape what is possible on a public ledger. In simple terms, it makes the Ledger far more usable for institutions, enterprises, and regulated applications. The upgrade allows controlled environments to exist on the same shared blockchain. Institutions can now operate inside clearly defined domains where participants are known, approved, and compliant, without giving up the speed, finality, and low-cost settlement XRPL is known for. Source: Chart from XRPScan This addresses a limitation in public blockchains, which are known for their openness. Public blockchains like the Ledger are great for openness, but the openness is unrealistic for banks, governments, and enterprises that must enforce rules, accountability, and identity checks. Permissioned Domains resolve that tension by letting both models coexist. Sensitive or regulated activity can happen inside restricted domains, while the broader ledger is open and permissionless for everyone else. Why This Matters For The Altcoin Going Forward The most favorable outcome for XRP is the broad adoption of the Ledger by banks and financial institutions in their day-to-day operations. Therefore, the activation of permissioned domains on the Ledger removes one of the last structural barriers to real-world adoption. XRPL can now serve as shared financial infrastructure, offering the guardrails regulators expect without sacrificing the benefits of a global public ledger. A bank can settle payments, a government can run regulated flows, and an enterprise can move large value, all without exposing sensitive operations to the entire public network. This is why the Permissioned Domains upgrade carries more weight than its quiet rollout. It might be overlooked for now, but this kind of change tends to show its impact gradually, especially when institutions start creating domains on the Ledger. Permissioned Domains is one of several amendments introduced by developers to strengthen the overall utility of the Ledger ecosystem. Another notable example is the lending feature, which is currently in the validator voting phase.

As XRP searches for a price floor amid broader market weakness, some holders are shifting focus from short-term price moves to strategies designed to stay steady through volatility. Summary XRP’s recent stabilization has moved market sentiment from panic toward cautious evaluation of whether a durable bottom can form. With price direction still uncertain, some investors are exploring fixed-income style participation models instead of relying on rebounds alone. Arc Miner positions itself as one such option, offering USD-settled, contract-based cloud mining designed to generate predictable daily income regardless of XRP price swings. After a significant decline, XRP has begun to show signs of stabilization, and market focus is gradually shifting from panic to a potential recovery.

The firm will hold a special shareholder vote on March 20 to seek approval for the move. Shares of BITF are up nearly 27% on Friday amid a crypto equities and token bounce. Publicly traded Bitcoin miner Bitfarms is fully detaching itself from the top crypto asset, changing its name to Keel Infrastructure as it seeks to transition its business to the United States to focus on empowering artificial intelligence (AI). The firm first announced its intentions in November to abandon its Bitcoin mining business , signaling a shift to providing infrastructure for AI as it saw an opportunity to improve net operating incomes. “Our new name reflects how we think about infrastructure, how we’re building this company, and how we want to serve our future customers,” CEO Ben Gagnon said in a Friday statement. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a plan to redomicile the company to the U.S. and move forward under a new name: Keel Infrastructure. The keel is the structural backbone of a vessel – the largely unseen but critical foundation that provides stability… — Bitfarms (@Bitfarms_io) February 6, 2026 “We are no longer a Bitcoin company, we are an infrastructure-first owner and developer for HPC/AI data centers across North America,” he continued. “As we enter this next chapter, our focus is simple: we’re building the infrastructure for the compute of the future.” Shares in the firm (BITF) have jumped 27% following the announcement and alongside a broader rebound in crypto equities and tokens on Friday, recently changing hands around $2.17. Upon the completion of its U.S. redomiciliation process, which is expected to be completed by April 1, the firm anticipates trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker KEEL. A shareholder vote will be held on March 20, and must be approved before the transition takes place. The firm’s move from Canada to the United States and its business shift have been the “culmination of a comprehensive strategic review process” by its board of directors over the last year—but its renewed focus on AI is not one it’s making alone. Publicly traded Bitcoin miners, like Riot Platforms , MARA Holdings , and CleanSpark , have all signaled at least a partial shift to AI. Others, like Cipher Mining and Hut 8 have made multibillion-dollar deals with Google to back AI data centers. The shift to AI may represent a more predictable revenue stream, as miners face uncertainty amid a falling Bitcoin price. The largest crypto asset by market cap dropped as low as $60,255 on Thursday before rebounding to recently change hands around $70,415. BTC is now down 16% in the last week and sits over 44% off its all-time high of $126,080.

Earlier leverage flushes eased forced selling, allowing prices to stabilize without new bullish catalysts. The durability of the rally remains uncertain as momentum weakens and macro risks persist. Global markets staged a broad rebound on February 6 after a sharp sell-off the previous day pushed stocks, crypto, and commodities into deeply oversold territory. Bitcoin recovered to around $70,000, while US equities, gold, and silver also advanced, driven by technical buying and easing near-term macro fears. The recovery followed a violent deleveraging phase rather than a shift in fundamentals. Sponsored Sponsored Technical Levels Sparked The Initial Bounce The rebound began after key technical levels held across asset classes.

That triggered mechanical buying from funds rebalancing risk exposure after several sessions of heavy selling. S&P 500 Chart. Source: Google Finance Bitcoin followed a similar pattern. After briefly falling to $60,000, the asset rebounded sharply as forced liquidations slowed and funding rates stabilized.

Consumer sentiment data released on February 6 came in stronger than expected, marking a six-month high. While not signaling strong growth, the data reduced immediate fears of a sudden economic deterioration. Bond markets reacted by pricing a slightly higher probability of a near-term rate cut from the Federal Reserve, pushing short-term yields lower before stabilizing. That shift eased financial conditions at the margin, supporting risk assets.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin sold thousands of ETH over the past few days as the token fell below $2,000, according to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain. The sales came during a broader wave of large-holder deleveraging that pushed ETH to multi-month lows and added to already heavy selling pressure across the market. ETH Sales Coincide With Heavy On-Chain Distribution On February 5, Lookonchain reported that wallets linked to the blockchain developer had sold 2,961 ETH worth about $6.6 million over three days at an average price near $2,228. Less than 24 hours later, the analytics account said total sales over the same three-day window had risen to 6,183 ETH, or roughly $13.2 million, with the average exit price closer to $2,140 as ETH continued to slide. Some of the proceeds were quickly redirected, with Buterin transferring about $500,000 he earned from the sale of 212 ETH on February 2 to Kanro, a philanthropic initiative tied to open-source biomedical research. Kanro Fund confirmed the transfer the same day and said the funds will be used to support anti–airborne-disease and pandemic-related projects. The group also pointed out that the Ethereum stalwart has been funding similar efforts for nearly three years, including a $20 million personal contribution made in October 2025. Buterin has publicly addressed his broader plans, saying in a recent post on X that he withdrew 16,384 ETH to support work spanning biotech, secure hardware, privacy-focused software, and other areas outside Ethereum’s core protocol. He framed the move as part of a period of tighter spending at the Ethereum Foundation. Institutions and Whales Repositioning The price of ETH has faced some severe action in the last few days, falling well below the $2,100 level that many traders viewed as a key support area and underperforming Bitcoin as risk appetite faded across altcoins.

On-chain data suggests the pressure is not limited to retail traders, with a February 5 CryptoQuant report showing U.S. investors have been selling ETH at a discount, pushing the Coinbase Premium Index to its lowest level since July 2022. That pattern points to institutional de-risking during the current correction. According to Lookonchain, other large holders have also been active. The firm reported on February 6 that Trend Research sold more than 170,000 ETH in under 10 hours to repay loans, while Aave founder Stani Kulechov sold about 4,500 ETH near $1,900. At the same time, some entities moved the other way, with serial crypto investors, 7 Siblings, buying 9,000 ETH for just under $2,000 each as prices dipped.

Tags:49:T1ae6,Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and other prominent “whales” have offloaded millions of dollars in ETH since the beginning of February, adding narrative fuel to a market rout that saw the world's second-largest cryptocurrency tumble below $2,000. While the high-profile sales by Buterin served as a psychological trigger for retail panic, a closer examination of market data suggests that the primary pressure came from a systemic unwind of leverage and record-breaking selling activity across the network. Nonetheless, these disposals, combined with significant selling by other industry insiders, have prompted investors to question whether project leaders are losing confidence or simply managing operational runways amid extreme volatility. Why is Buterin selling his Ethereum holdings? In the past 3 days, Buterin sold 6,183 ETH ($13.24M) at an average price of $2,140, according to blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain . Vitalik Buterin ETH Sales (Source: Lookonchain) However, the specifics of Buterin’s transactions reveal a calculated, rather than panic-driven, strategy. Notably, Buterin publicly disclosed that he had set aside 16,384 ETH, valued at approximately $43- $45 million at the time, to be deployed over the coming years. He stated the funds are earmarked for open-source security, privacy technology, and broader public-good infrastructure as the Ethereum Foundation enters what he described as a period of “mild austerity.” In this light, the most defensible explanation for “why he sold” is mundane. It appears to be the conversion of a pre-allocated ETH budget into spendable runway (stablecoins) for a multi-year funding plan rather than a sudden attempt to time the market top. However, the channel through which these sales affect the market is more narrative-driven than liquidity-based. When investors see founder wallets active on the sell side during a downturn, it tilts sentiment and deepens the bearish resolve of an already shaky market. Still, Buterin remains an ETH whale, holding over 224,105 ETH, which is equivalent to approximately $430 million. Did Buterin's ETH sales precipitate a market crash? The central question for investors is whether Buterin’s selling mechanically pushed ETH below $2,000. From a structural perspective, it is difficult to argue that Buterin's $13.24 million sell program, by itself, breaks a major market level, given ETH's multi-billion-dollar daily trading volume. So, a sell order of this magnitude is small relative to typical turnover and lacks the volume required to consume order book depth and drive prices down significantly on its own. However, Buterin was not selling in a vacuum. He was part of a broader exodus of large holders that collectively weighed on the market. On-chain trackers flagged significant activity from Stani Kulechov, the founder of the DeFi protocol Aave. Kulechov sold 4,503 Ethereum (valued at about $8.36 million) at a price of around $1,857 just hours before ETH's slide accelerated. This activity is symptomatic of a broader trend. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the network has faced record selling activity this month. Ethereum Spot Average Order Size (Source: CryptoQuant) The analytics firm noted that the network had seen an increase in large whale order sizes during the downturn, suggesting that high-net-worth individuals and entities were actively de-risking into the liquidity provided by the drop. Ethereum Taker Volume (Source: CryptoQuant) While a single whale cannot crash the market, a synchronized exit by industry leaders can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. When liquidity is thin and leverage is stretched, these “headline flows” signal to the broader market that “smart money” is de-risking, prompting smaller traders to follow suit in a bid to preserve capital. The real drivers behind ETH's crash While the narrative focused on founder wallets, the bulk of the crash was driven by three distinct market forces: leverage unwinding, ETF outflows, and macroeconomic headwinds. Data from Coinglass indicated hundreds of millions of dollars in ETH liquidations over 24 hours during the worst of the move, with long liquidations dominating. This created classic cascading conditions in which price declines trigger forced sales from overleveraged positions, which in turn trigger further declines and additional forced selling.

You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. Simultaneously, institutional support evaporated. US spot ETH ETFs have recorded about $2.5 billion of net outflows over the past four months, according to SoSo Value data. This occurred alongside much larger outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. This represents the kind of institutional de-risking that matters more than any one wallet when the market is already sliding. Compounding these crypto-specific issues is the macroeconomic backdrop. Reuters tied the broader crypto drawdown to a cross-asset selloff and tighter liquidity fears. The crypto market has shed about $2 trillion from its peak in October 2025, with roughly $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone, as investors reduced risk and leveraged positions unwound. Indicators to watch As the market attempts to find a floor, three indicators will matter more than any whale alert. First is liquidation intensity. If forced liquidations remain elevated, ETH can continue to “gap” lower even without additional discretionary selling. A decline in liquidation totals alongside stabilization is often the first sign the cascade has burned out, according to Phemex analysts. Second is the ETF flows regime. One day of outflows is noise, but a multi-week streak changes the marginal buyer. ETH's near-term path depends heavily on whether institutional flows stabilize or continue to bleed into broader risk-off behavior. Finally, investors should watch exchange inflows and large-holder behavior. Founder wallets are visible, but the more telling indicator is whether large holders increase deposits at exchanges (distribution) or whether coins move into cold storage and staking (accumulation). When those signals flip, the market usually follows. The bottom line remains that Vitalik Buterin’s sales are best understood as the execution of a pre-announced funding plan tied to public goods and open-source spending, not as a sudden loss of faith. But in a collapse driven by leverage liquidations, ETF outflows, and macro risk-off, even “small” founder sales can have disproportionate effects. They do so not by supplying enough ETH to break $2,000, but by adding narrative fuel to a market already searching for a reason to sell first and ask questions later. Mentioned in this article Posted in4a:T418,Ethereum recently dropped below the $2,000 mark, a decline partially fueled by significant sell-offs from co-founder Vitalik Buterin and other industry whales. While Buterin clarified that his sale of over 6,000 ETH was part of a pre-allocated budget for public-good infrastructure rather than panic selling, these transactions negatively impacted market sentiment. This insider selling, combined with similar moves by figures like Aave founder Stani Kulechov, has raised concerns among investors about project confidence amidst a market downturn.

However, the primary drivers behind the crash are systemic rather than just narrative-based. Data indicates that the price slump was largely caused by a massive unwind of leverage, cascading liquidations, and record-breaking selling activity across the network. Additionally, the market has been hit by approximately $2.5 billion in net outflows from US spot ETH ETFs over the last four months, alongside broader macroeconomic headwinds and tighter liquidity that have spurred a cross-asset selloff.4b:Tce6,Journalist Posted: February 7, 2026 Tether has announced a strategic investment in t-0 network , a USD₮-powered settlement platform designed for licensed financial institutions, marking a further push to extend the stablecoin into cross-border payments infrastructure. The initiative aims to enable near-instant, net-settled fiat-to-fiat transfers between banks and fintechs, using USD₮ as the underlying settlement layer. The system is positioned as a non-custodial network. It records and matches transactions across participating institutions before settling net balances on-chain. From trading liquidity to settlement use cases USD₮ has long played a central role in crypto market liquidity, particularly during periods of market stress. Tether’s move into payments infrastructure reflects a broader effort to adapt stablecoin usage toward settlement and treasury functions. Paolo Ardoino, chief executive of Tether, said the investment was intended to address inefficiencies in international payments rather than target consumer-facing use cases. “The t-0 network directly addresses the complexity of international payments by combining real-time settlement, cost efficiency, FX transparency, and global reach,” Ardoino said, adding that Tether aims to support infrastructure that can scale across regulated markets. Why the timing matters The announcement follows a period in which USD₮ supply expanded even as the broader crypto market contracted. In the final quarter of 2025, Tether’s circulating supply grew while overall crypto market capitalization fell sharply. This suggests capital rotation into stablecoins rather than a full withdrawal from on-chain markets. That divergence has reinforced USD₮’s role as a defensive liquidity layer, helping explain why settlement-oriented infrastructure is now a strategic focus. Institutional focus over retail adoption Unlike consumer payment applications, the t-0 network is explicitly designed for banks and regulated financial institutions. It connects participants through a single API and settles only net balances in each institution’s chosen currency, reducing prefunding requirements and limiting foreign exchange exposure. James Brownlee, chief executive of t-0 network, said the system was built to simplify cross-border payments for institutional users. “Our goal is to make global payments feel local,” Brownlee said, describing the platform as a way to reduce friction between developed and emerging markets without requiring institutions to overhaul existing systems. Incremental shift, not immediate disruption Tether did not disclose the size of its investment or provide a timeline for commercial rollout. No transaction volumes or participating institutions have yet been announced. While stablecoin-based settlement systems are increasingly discussed as alternatives to correspondent banking, adoption is likely to remain gradual and shaped by regulatory clarity, integration challenges, and demonstrated reliability at scale. Final Thoughts Tether’s investment reflects growing demand for USD₮ as institutional settlement liquidity rather than purely trading collateral. Stablecoins are edging closer to payments infrastructure, but widespread adoption remains incremental and regulation-dependent.4c:T542,Coinbase will support the Sui token standard across its platform, expanding institutional and retail access to the L1 network. Sui Network, a high-performance layer-1 blockchain platform, and Coinbase, a leading crypto exchange, announced a partnership today to expand institutional and retail access via the Sui token standard.

The partnership builds on Coinbase’s December move to enable SUI trading for New York residents, a key milestone under the state’s stringent BitLicense regime. Sui became more accessible to a regulated retail base, widening its reach in one of the toughest crypto jurisdictions. Bitwise also filed in December for a SUI ETF that would use Coinbase Custody for asset storage, adding to the competition for Sui-focused investment products. SUI traded near $1 at press time, up 14% on the day after recovering from yesterday’s lows of $0.78 during Bitcoin’s drop below $60K.4d:T91b,The token is outperforming the broader crypto market amid a string of Ripple announcements. XRP outperformed the broader cryptocurrency market on Friday, Feb. 6, rising nearly 20% over the past 24 hours. The token was trading around $1.50, after briefly touching a high near $1.53, per The Defiant’s price page . XRP’s market capitalization now stands at about $91.3 billion. XRP also strengthened against Bitcoin (BTC), gaining more than 13% on the BTC pair, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volume climbed to roughly $16.5 billion. The rally came as investor sentiment improved following a series of Ripple announcements this week, with the latest being the company teasing major upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) on Feb. 5. In a blog post , Ripple outlined how new and upcoming features on the XRP Ledger would expand XRP’s real-world utility beyond payments. The company also said that XRP is increasingly being used across stablecoin settlement, FX, tokenized assets, and lending. “With each use case, XRP’s role becomes more intertwined in institutional finance, either as the asset being moved, the bridge facilitating exchange, or the reserve currency backing network security,” the post reads. Earlier this week, the team also announced that Ripple Prime added support for Hyperliquid – the largest decentralized perpetual futures platform by trading volume and open interest (OI), according to DeFiLlama. The move aims to provide institutional clients with on-chain derivatives liquidity through Ripple’s prime brokerage platform. “At Ripple Prime, we are excited to continue leading the way in merging decentralized finance with traditional prime brokerage services, offering direct support to trading, yield generation and a wider range of digital assets,” said Michael Higgins, International CEO, Ripple Prime. “This strategic extension of our prime brokerage platform into DeFi will enhance our clients' access to liquidity, providing the greater efficiency and innovation that our institutional clients demand.” XRP’s rebound comes amid a broader market downturn that has stretched for weeks. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading under $70,000 – a price point not seen since Nov. 2024. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is currently changing hands at $2,000, down 25% on the week.4e:T44d,XRP surged nearly 20% over the past 24 hours to trade around $1.50, significantly outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market which is currently facing a downturn. The token’s market capitalization reached approximately $91.3 billion, with its price rising more than 13% against Bitcoin despite Bitcoin trading below $70,000 and Ethereum dropping to $2,000. This rally was driven by improved investor sentiment following a series of strategic announcements from Ripple regarding network expansion and institutional services.

The price jump came after Ripple teased major upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) aimed at expanding XRP's utility beyond payments into stablecoin settlement, foreign exchange, tokenized assets, and lending. Additionally, Ripple Prime announced support for Hyperliquid, a leading decentralized perpetual futures platform, to provide institutional clients with direct access to on-chain derivatives liquidity. These moves highlight Ripple's efforts to integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional institutional finance, enhancing the utility and demand for XRP.4f:Td1d,The latest Epstein Files release has placed a variety of powerful men under renewed scrutiny thanks to their familiarity with the notorious child rapist. Undoubtedly, those who chose to closely associate with Epstein will be frustrated that these relationships are now public and won’t remain “another wonderful secret.” Read more: Brock Pierce’s dark and disturbing friendship with Jeffrey Epstein One of the most shocking things that Protos has found so far was that Epstein was an investor in Coinbase. Specifically, Blockchain Capital principals Bart and Brad Stephens, along with Brock Pierce, helped facilitate the investment of $3 million worth of Epstein’s money into the company . When we initially encountered this reveal, we assumed that Coinbase would at least have a plausible excuse that it didn’t realize that Epstein was the man behind the money. Unfortunately for Coinbase, it doesn’t have a fig leaf to hide behind. Pierce specifically reached out to Epstein to tell him that if he wanted to participate in the Coinbase round, then Brock would need “to let the founder know who you are, which would not be disclosed beyond that.” It has obviously been disclosed beyond that at this point. Even if that single email was insufficient, there’s another series of emails that include Coinbase founder Fred Ehrsam, which show that he was aware of Epstein’s involvement. Ehrsam had reached out to Brad Stephens to remind him they’d been planning a meeting, and Brad had to inform Ehrsam that “Jeff was in a full afternoon board meeting yesterday” and added that “Brock is working with his EA to ideally find a time for you two to meet today.” Ehrsam then responded with his availability and said it “ would be nice to meet him .” Following these emails, Coinbase provides its wire information to Blockchain Capital, which then reaches out to someone working with Epstein to figure out what entity he will be using to make his investment. Years later, in 2018, Blockchain Capital would enter into negotiations to purchase this position from Epstein, and they were willing to initially pay $15 million for Epstein’s original $3 million investment, an offer that Epstein rejected. Epstein instead counter-offered, suggesting instead that Blockchain Capital should pay $11 million for 50% of the entity that Epstein used to make the investment. Some deal here was eventually closed, with Pierce and Epstein emailing each other to discuss exactly that. The truly shocking thing about this series of emails is that Coinbase had no illusions about what money they were taking. It, surprisingly, actually did the due diligence, looked into who wanted to invest, tried to meet with Epstein, and decided after this due diligence process that it should accept that funding. What name could Coinbase’s due diligence have turned up that it would have rejected? Convicted pedophiles weren’t bad enough apparently . In giving Epstein this opportunity to get into Coinbase early, many years before public market investors would have a chance, it enriched someone it knew was a sexual predator and a pedophile. Coinbase is extraordinarily tolerant of pedophiles; it will collaborate with pedophiles, and it will enrich pedophiles. When it comes to money for Coinbase, pedophilia isn’t a deal-breaker. — Bennett Tomlin50:T8a3,Tech stocks rebounded early Friday after over a week of selloffs, with Nvidia leading the charge as NVDA rose 7%. US stocks jumped on Friday as Wall Street reassessed worries about the impact of AI disruption and the risks of hefty Big Tech spending. The S&P 500 jumped 1.7% Friday and was flirting with its best day since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,060 points, or 2.2%, as of 1 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 2% higher. Chip companies helped drive the widespread rally, and Nvidia jumped 7.3% to trim its weekly loss, which came into the day at just over 10%. Broadcom climbed 7.5% to erase its drop for the week fully. Additionally, Nvidia (NVDA) is positioned to benefit from the expected $650 billion AI investment by Big Tech in 2026, despite market volatility affecting tech stocks. Analysts maintain a strong Buy rating on Nvidia, highlighting its potential in the AI sector as the market stabilizes after recent corrections. The sector as a whole appears ready to rebound from the recent losses, and Nvidia could play a big part in that should this be the start of a rally higher again. Also Read: Amazon (AMZN) Tanks 8% After Q4 Earnings: What Went Wrong? On the other hand, some tech stocks’ slumps persisted. Amazon’s (AMZN) shares tumbled 7% on Friday. In its earnings, the major cloud provider outlined plans for a massive 2026 jump in spending to at least $200 billion, even as its forecast for operating income fell short. Shares in Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta also fell on Friday. NVIDIA’s return to $200 as it did last Fall is seen as a potential turning point for tech stocks. To open 2026, things have been rocky, but NVDA’s inevitable rebound, as a market leader, could fuel other tech stocks to rally. NVIDIA (NVDA) holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), indicating strong analyst confidence in its earnings potential. Furthermore, Analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Nvidia with price targets ranging from $220 to $320. Cantor Fitzgerald and Melius Research have the highest price targets at $300 and $320, respectively. In addition, DA Davidson recently upgraded Nvidia’s rating, maintaining a Buy with a target of $250, showing confidence in NVDA51:T582,Chipmaker rebounds with $300B in gains as Jensen Huang calls AI buildout a once-in-a-generation infrastructure wave. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pushed back on investor concerns about overbuilding data center capacity, calling the current wave of AI infrastructure spending both sustainable and necessary. “The demand is just incredibly high,” Huang said on CNBC, adding that the AI buildout will continue for seven to eight years. He characterized the effort as a “once in a generation infrastructure buildout.” The comments came as Nvidia shares rebounded sharply Friday, jumping as much as 7.5% in their biggest intraday gain since April. The rally added more than $300 billion in market value, partially recovering from a $500 billion selloff over the past week. Investor sentiment improved after Amazon announced plans to spend $200 billion this year on data centers, chips, and other infrastructure. Combined spending from Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft is expected to reach $650 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, a 60% increase from last year. While shares of big tech remain under pressure, the surge in spending has lifted infrastructure providers across the AI supply chain. Semiconductor stocks, including Broadcom and Marvell, climbed 6% and 7% respectively, alongside digital storage firms Sandisk and Western Digital, which rose 4% and 7%. Cloud services firm CoreWeave surged 20%.52:Teb5,In brief Thousands of Coinbase users lost money this week as crypto-backed loans soured. The exchange’s users have faced $170 million in liquidations over the past week. The losses represent the most in the product’s one-year history. Coinbase customers are experiencing pain in new ways as Bitcoin and Ethereum tumble, with losses piling up for thousands of users through the exchange’s crypto-backed lending product. Over the past week, Coinbase users have lost $170 million worth of collateral through liquidations on DeFi platform Morpho, according to a Dune dashboard . As Bitcoin and Ethereum notched double-digit declines , some 2,000 users lost $90.7 million on Thursday alone. When Coinbase began providing access to Bitcoin-backed loans last year, the company positioned the product as a way for people to grow their wealth. It later expanded to Ethereum-backed loans, while raising loan limits to $5 million per customer. As Bitcoin and Ethereum have respectively dropped 17% and 26% over the past week, an increasing number of users’ loans have reached the point where they are considered unhealthy, allowing third-parties to repay them—and scoop up the collateral at a discounted rate. As users’ loans have approached the point of liquidation, some have added more collateral or paid down debts in the form of Circle’s USDC stablecoin. Over the past week, around 3,300 users have sat idle as their Bitcoin and Ethereum was whisked away for good. The losses may be a small sum amid the broader crypto crash, but the dynamic shows how Coinbase's efforts to fold DeFi into its business can directly impact users as the company pursues its ambitions of becoming an “ everything exchange .” Since its debut last January, the product has originated $1.8 billion in loans. If users’ collateral were to fall another 50% in value, Coinbase users could lose $600 million, but a Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt that the exchange notifies users frequently when their loans are at risk of liquidation, “up to every 30 minutes.” Compared to traditional loans, the spokesperson described crypto-backed loans as faster, cheaper, and more efficient. They noted that crypto-backed loans can also offer better rates. As a risk management tool, all loans on Morpho are over-collateralized by default. At the same time, the exchange’s app “enforces an additional buffer when users take out a loan to reduce liquidation risk,” while notifying them of that potential outcome, the spokesperson said. The exchange is exploring additional ways for users to protect their loans, they added, acknowledging that crypto-backed loans come with their own set of risks that users should understand. The spokesperson said that Coinbase doesn’t earn any fees from users’ liquidations. But the company still makes money on the product as a technology provider by receiving a cut of performance fees that are earned by risk managers. Coinbase once offered Bitcoin-backed loans in a centralized manner, but it stopped issuing them in May 2023 amid an uptick in regulatory scrutiny toward the industry. Through its new product, people don’t need to provide personal information before lending to Americans. In October, when Bitcoin traded near an all-time high above $126,000, Max Branzburg, head of consumer products at Coinbase, told Decrypt that the exchange was “empowering people to help grow their wealth in ways that they couldn’t otherwise.” He said he had observed people tapping Coinbase’s product to make important moves without needing to sell their Bitcoin, like purchasing a car or renovating a home.

Unfortunately, 100% of the company’s convertible debt is now “out-of-the-money.” With the firm’s 2030A convertible bond notes, the final holdout from last week, joining the other five series in reaching out-of-the-money territory, all six series now have a conversion price above the price of MSTR, Strategy’s common stock. In plain English, it’s now worse for bondholders to convert into common stock rather than just keeping their bonds as bonds. As a result, Strategy will need to continue servicing their coupons, and principal cash repayments. While all bondholders are out-of-the-money, in other words, these convertibles will not convert into MSTR and will, instead, continue to drag on the cash obligations of the company going forward. These creditors will demand on-time interest payouts and principal repayment through June 2032, unless the price of MSTR starts to rally and sufficiently motivate them to exercise their convertible options. Strategy’s bonds pay interest coupons of 2.25%, 0.625%, and 0%, depending on their upcoming maturities. The company has $8.2 billion worth of notional debt outstanding. Read more: Michael Saylor missed out on a $33 billion profit at Strategy Strategy must service its out-of-the-money debts Bonds, in capital stack seniority, rank even higher than preferred shares in terms of the company’s cash obligations. Unlike common stock at the bottom of the stack or preferred dividends which the company’s board of directors may suspend at any time, Strategy must service its debts unless it wants to default. Defaulting is normally a catastrophic decision from a financial perspective, risking downgrades by credit analysts, uncertainty in pricing listed securities, and possible legal action by the bondholders. Whereas an in-the-money cushion above the company’s convertibles is widely viewed as a sign of financial strength, all convertibles issued by Strategy have punctured through that safety net. Sure, they helped the company raise money to buy bitcoin in the past, but now they have long-lasting consequences. No longer able to convert them into MSTR — unless MSTR rallies substantially — founder Michael Saylor must continue to repay bonds with cash or drum up more demand for MSTR so that its price rallies above bondholders’ conversion price. Conversion prices for Strategy bonds range from a low of $149.77 to a high of $672.40. Options traders coined the term out-of-the-money when “the money” simply meant the actual, realizable, current cash value of a position. Traders used out-of-the-money as a shorthand reference to having no immediate cash worth by exercising a right like an option or warrant. An option whose strike, or conversion, price was already favorable relative to prevailing prices of the underlying was “in the money” because there was real money on the table. Got a tip?

Zcash ( ZEC ) has fallen roughly 60% from its November 2025 high, extending a multi-month slide that has reversed much of the asset’s Q4 gains. The privacy-focused coin, which was the top-performing large-cap crypto asset of 2025 , began its downward trend in December, shortly after the Winklevoss -backed Zcash treasury company Cypherpunk Technologies last disclosed a ZEC purchase, its third since launching. Cypherpunk, which launched in November as a Zcash-focused treasury company, last reported buying ZEC on Dec. 30, 2025, bringing its holdings to 290,062.67 ZEC. The spot price of Zcash has dropped over 50% since then. The firm hasn’t announced any new purchases, and CoinGecko data shows total holdings have remained the same since.

Cypherpunk has said it aims to build a position equal to 5% of the token’s supply. ZEC price since Cypherpunk’s last public purchase disclosure on Dec. 30. Source: CoinGecko With an average ZEC purchase price of about $334, Cypherpunk Technologies is sitting on an unrealized loss of $25.73 million, down 26.5%, with ZEC trading around $245 at press time. ZEC kicked off a multi-month rally this fall, starting in late September, reaching as high as $700 in mid-November. While the privacy coin has retraced much of its 2025 gains, it’s still trading almost 400% higher than its pre-rally levels in September. The Defiant reached out to Cypherpunk to clarify its plans for the DAT, but hasn’t received a response by press time. Cypherpunk Technologies Inc. share price over 6 months. Source: Google Finance Meanwhile, Cypherpunk’s shares have dropped about 40% over the past 30 days, though they remain over 100% higher than in November, before the company rebranded from a biotech firm, Leap Therapeutics, Inc, to a Zcash DAT, according to data from Google Finance . Top DATs Keep Buying Cypherpunk’s pace of ZEC purchases stands out against more aggressive digital asset treasury (DAT) strategies elsewhere in crypto. The original and largest DAT, Michael Saylor’s Strategy, has been making its BTC purchases on a weekly basis for over a year, with few exceptions. While Strategy’s unrealized losses have ballooned to about $4.36 billion amid the market downturn, the firm has kept up its accumulation cadence, making five Bitcoin purchases so far in 2026, according to the company’s data . Tom Lee’s BitMine , the largest Ethereum DAT, has kept pace so far this year with the same number of ETH purchases, per data from DefiLlama. BitMine’s unrealized losses reached $6 billion this week as the spot price of ETH slipped below $2,000. Amid Cypherpunk’s dropping shares and rising paper losses, Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, announced this week that it’s restructuring its business. The company said in a blog post on Thursday, Feb. 5, that it plans to cut roughly 25% of its remaining workforce and exit Europe, the UK, and Australia, as it doubles down on the U.S. market.55:T405,Zcash (ZEC) has plummeted over 50% since Cypherpunk Technologies, a Winklevoss-backed digital asset treasury (DAT), last disclosed a purchase on December 30, 2025. Since launching in November, Cypherpunk has accumulated approximately 290,000 ZEC, representing about 1.76% of the token's total supply, but has paused accumulation as the price fell to around $245. The company is now facing an unrealized loss of $25.73 million, even though ZEC remains up nearly 400% compared to its pre-rally levels in September 2025.

Despite the market downturn, other major DATs have continued their aggressive accumulation strategies. Michael Saylor’s Strategy has kept buying Bitcoin (BTC) weekly, and Tom Lee’s BitMine has maintained its pace of purchasing Ethereum (ETH), though both hold significant unrealized losses. Meanwhile, Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, announced a major restructuring involving a 25% workforce reduction and an exit from Europe, the UK, and Australia to focus on the U.S. market.56:T967,Zcash (ZEC) ร่วงลงมากกว่า 50% นับจากการที่ Cypherpunk Technologies บริษัท Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) ที่ได้รับการสนับสนุนจาก Winklevoss ได้ซื้อเหรียญครั้งล่าสุดเมื่อวันที่ 30 ธันวาคม 2025 ตั้งแต่เปิดตัวในเดือนพฤศจิกายน Cypherpunk ได้สะสม ZEC ไปประมาณ 290,000 เหรียญ หรือคิดเป็น 1.76% ของอุปทานทั้งหมด แต่ได้หยุดการสะสมชั่วคราวเนื่องจากราคาตกลงมาอยู่ที่ระดับ 245 ดอลลาร์ บริษัทจึงขาดทุนจากการยังไม่ได้ขาย (unrealized loss) อยู่ 25.73 ล้านดอลลาร์ แม้ว่าราคา ZEC จะยังสูงกว่าระดับก่อนเกิดการเดินสายราคา (pre-rally) ในเดือนกันยายนกว่า 400% ก็ตาม

Ad Disclosure XRP experienced one of its most significant rallies ever in this cycle, reaching a new all-time high. However, with the broader cryptocurrency market turning extremely volatile, the price of altcoin has now fallen dangerously close to the $1 mark. Despite the notable decline, on-chain metrics suggest that the altcoin could still be set for more downside movement in the upcoming weeks and months. XRP Is Facing Bear Market Threat The XRP bloodbath has continued after falling by nearly 20% on Thursday, with the price of the altcoin now positioned at $1.22. Meanwhile, fresh data are flashing strong warning signs about a potential continuation of the current downward trend. Advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, Alphractal, has outlined a growing cluster of on-chain and market metrics, which suggests that XRP may be approaching the edge of an aggressive bear market phase. Liquidity, holder behavior, and derivatives positioning indicators are starting to line up in a manner that has historically preceded more dramatic declines. Specifically, 3 different key metrics are hinting at this impending bear market phase for the leading altcoin. These metrics include the Realized Cap Impulse, the MVRV Z-Score , and the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL). Currently, data from Realized Cap Impulse shows that new capital is flowing out of XRP. As for the MVRV Z-Score, which is sitting right on a key level, the metric hints at either a bear market continuation or the last on-chain support. Meanwhile, the NUPL is also at its transition line, and a further drop implies that most XRP activity will shift into unrealized losses. Source: Chart from Alpractal on X XRP is now sitting exactly at a critical on-chain transition point. In other words, the altcoin is in a fragile state . If the price declines a little more, the data suggests conditions could deteriorate fast, paving the way for an extended bear market and potential capitulation phase. Alphractal also highlighted that if the 3 metrics display extended weakness, the ongoing selling pressure will probably increase in the upcoming days. Thus, this makes the moment a crucial one for monitoring and for making data-driven decisions in order to position ahead of possible upside or downside moves. Short-Term Holders Are The Major Sellers XRP’s current downtrend is not entirely a surprise, given the growing selling pressure from its holders . Steph is Crypto, a market analyst and trader, disclosed that the renewed selling activity is emerging from the short-term holders, who appear to be the primary source of distribution. Data shows that wallet addresses aged between 1 week and 1 month have experienced a drop from 5.27% to 3.6% in the past few days. Meanwhile, wallet addresses that fall under the 1-month to 3-month category are down from 11.53% to 9.29%. When newer market players are offloading their positions in volatile conditions, it is often caused by weak conviction in the altcoin and higher risk tolerance. While these short-term holders are constantly selling their coins, Steph is Crypto highlighted that long-term holders are doing the opposite. These investors are not selling and are holding on to their coins. For now, only weak hands are the ones that are selling in the market.

The memecoin breached $0.09 and dipped to August 2024 lows around $0.08 before rebounding to $0.093. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.09064, down 11.4% on the daily charts. Over the same period, the memecoin market cap fell by more than $1 billion, reflecting substantial outflows. Dogecoin faces bearishness DOGE exhibited stubborn weakness as the market shifted entirely bearish, and traders aggressively liquidated their positions. On the spot side, for example, the market exhibited total seller dominance. According to Coinalyze data, the memecoin recorded 3.1 billion in Sell Volume between the 5th and 6th of February. Over the same period, the memecoin recorded 2.6 billion in Buy Volume, leaving the market with a negative delta of 400 million. Source: Coinalyze Often, a negative buy-sell delta suggests that sellers have the upper hand in the market and that their attempts have been futile. A sustained period of increased selling activity intensifies downward pressure, often a prelude to lower prices, as recently observed. On the futures side, traders aggressively closed their positions as they derisked and deleveraged. CoinGlass data showed that Dogecoin recorded $2.22 billion in Futures outflows compared to $2.18 billion in inflows. Source: CoinGlass At press time, the memecoin’s Futures Netflow stood at -$39 million, improving from the previously recorded -$88 million. This increase in outflows indicates that many futures market participants closed their positions, either to limit losses or secure profits. In fact, Open Interest declined 16.7% to $986.39 million, reflecting reduced market leverage, a clear bearish signal. Can DOGE bulls reclaim $0.1? Dogecoin strengthened its position below $0.1, as every market participant turned bearish and aggressively closed their positions. As a result, the downward momentum strengthened, as evidenced by the Stochastic RSI. This momentum indicator fell further into the bearish zone, hitting 13 .70 as of writing. A momentum indicator at such low levels suggested intense downward pressure, with sellers exerting total control over the market. Source: TradingView At the same time, the memecoin traded below its short- and long-term Moving Averages (EMAs), further confirming downward momentum. These market conditions leave DOGE in a weakened position, risking further price losses. Thus, if sellers continue to offload, DOGE will likely drop towards $0.08 again. For a meaningful trend reversal, bulls must increase buying pressure and reclaim the EMA20 at $0.11, setting the stage for a move towards $0.12. Final Thoughts DOGE continued its bearish streak, breached $0.09 slevel and fell to August 2024 lows of $0.08 Dogecoin weakness persisted as investors across the market aggressively closed positions.59:T4e6,Dogecoin faced significant downward pressure, slipping over 11% and falling below the critical $0.1 support level to trade around $0.09064. This decline resulted in the memecoin's market cap shedding more than $1 billion, as spot market data indicated strong seller dominance with a negative buy-sell delta. The drop brought DOGE near its August 2024 lows of $0.08 before a minor rebound, reflecting a broad market shift toward bearish sentiment.

Technical indicators and futures market data reinforce the bearish trend, with traders aggressively deleveraging and closing positions. Open Interest dropped by 16.7% to $986.39 million, and Dogecoin recorded substantial futures outflows, reflecting widespread risk-off behavior. Additionally, the Stochastic RSI has plummeted deep into the bearish zone, and the price is trading below key moving averages, suggesting sellers currently have total control.

Looking ahead, if selling pressure persists, DOGE risks revisiting the $0.08 support level. However, a trend reversal remains possible if bulls can muster enough buying pressure to reclaim the EMA20 at $0.11, which could pave the way for a rally towards $0.12. Until then, the market outlook remains weak and precarious as investor confidence wanes.5a:Tad7,Dogecoin (DOGE) เผชิญกับแรงกดดันขาลงอย่างหนัก โดยราคาดิ่งลงมากกว่า 11% ทะลุแนวรับที่สำคัญที่ระดับ $0.1 จนถึงระดับประมาณ $0.09064 การดิ่งลงครั้งนี้ทำให้มูลค่าตามราคาตลาด (Market Cap) ระเหิดไปมากกว่า 1 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ข้อมูลตลาด Spot ชี้ให้เห็นว่าผู้ขายมีอำนาจเหนือกว่าอย่างชัดเจน และราคาได้แตะระดับต่ำสุดตั้งแต่เดือนสิงหาคม 2024 ที่ $0.08 ก่อนจะมีการดีดตัวกลับเล็กน้อย

ตัวชี้วัดทางเทคนิคและข้อมูลจากตลาด Futures ยืนยันแนวโน้มขาลง โดยนักเทรดกำลังปิดสถานะและลดความเสี่ยง (Deleveraging) อย่างมาก Open Interest ลดลง 16.7% พร้อมกับการไหลออกของเงินทุนในตลาด Futures สะท้อนถึงความระมัดระวังของนักลงทุน นอกจากนี้ Stochastic RSI ยังได้ลงไปอยู่ในโซนขาลงลึก และราคาซื้อขายอยู่ต่ำกว่าค่าเฉลี่ยเคลื่อนที่ (EMA) สำคัญ ซึ่งบ่งชี้ว่าผู้ขายครองบังลังก์อยู่ในตอนนี้

ในมุมมองข้างหน้า หากแรงขายยังคงดำเนินต่อไป DOGE มีความเสี่ยงที่จะร่วงลงไปทดสอบแนวรับ $0.08 อีกครั้ง อย่างไรก็ตาม การกลับตัวฟื้นตัวยังเป็นไปได้หากผู้ซื้อกลับเข้ามาแรงพอที่จะทะลุ EMA20 ที่ระดับ $0.11 ซึ่งอาจเป็นสัญญาณเริ่มต้นการปรับตัวขึ้นสู่ระดับ $0.12 จนกว่าจะถึงเวลานั้น ทิศทางตลาดยังคงอ่อนแอและมีความเสี่ยงสูง5b:Tf9c,Ethereum price crashes 29% to May 2025 lows amid panic selling. On chain data shows $1.2 billion losses and long term holders selling. Oversold conditions could fuel rebound if Ethereum reclaims $2,000 support soon decisively. Ethereum has suffered a sharp correction, with price falling nearly 29% over the past week and slipping below the $2,000 mark. ETH is now trading at levels last seen nine months ago, reflecting severe weakness across the market. Diminishing buyer support has worsened conditions, with on-chain data confirming growing stress among Ethereum holders. Sponsored Sponsored Ethereum Holders Move Back To Selling Ethereum holders have increasingly resorted to panic selling as broader market conditions deteriorated. On-chain data from the Realized Profit/Loss indicator shows investors selling despite being underwater. Realized losses surged past $1.2 billion within 24 hours, highlighting widespread capitulation as holders prioritize risk reduction over recovery. Such elevated realized losses often extend declines by reinforcing negative momentum. As more ETH is sold at a loss, the price faces additional downward pressure. This behavior suggests confidence remains fragile, limiting the ability of Ethereum to stabilize until selling activity meaningfully subsides across the network. Want more token insights like this?

The HODLer Net Position Change has declined, with bars flipping red, signaling net outflows from long-term wallets. This shift is notable because long-term holders are typically considered the backbone of Ethereum’s market structure and price stability. Sponsored Sponsored When long-term holders distribute rather than accumulate, it often signals deep concern. Their decision to sell amid mounting losses indicates rising panic even among conviction-driven investors. This development adds macro-level pressure and increases the risk that Ethereum’s decline could deepen before a meaningful recovery begins. Ethereum HODLer Position Change. Source: Glassnode ETH Price Could Note A Reversal Ethereum price is trading near $1,920 at the time of writing after a 29% drop in one week. The move below $2,000 has reinforced bearish structure across multiple timeframes. Given the prevailing on-chain and sentiment indicators, ETH remains vulnerable to additional downside in the near term. ETH is currently holding above the $1,796 support level. If this level fails, price could slide toward $1,671 or lower. Ethereum is already at a nine-month low, last seen in May 2025, increasing the risk of further liquidation-driven selling if support breaks. Ethereum Price Analysis. Source: TradingView A recovery scenario remains possible if selling pressure eases. Ethereum could reclaim $2,000, supported by oversold conditions. The Money Flow Index sits well below the 20.0 threshold, indicating selling pressure has likely saturated. Historically, such readings have preceded short-term relief rallies. Ethereum MFI. Source: TradingView A similar rebound could unfold if investors refrain from further selling. Holding supply off exchanges may allow ETH to regain momentum. Under this scenario, Ethereum could push beyond $2,000 and advance toward $2,500. Securing that move would invalidate the bearish thesis and restore market confidence.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded three consecutive days of outflows, with $431 million exiting on Thursday, according to data from Farside Investors. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price briefly dipped to $60,074 on Friday before recovering above $64,930 as of 7:49 a.m. UTC. Warsh — who previously served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 — is expected to continue the interest rate cut trajectory. His nomination may also signal that broader market liquidity is expected to “stabilize rather than meaningfully expand,” Thomas Perfumo, economist at crypto exchange Kraken, told Cointelegraph.

The company defends against illicit activities that increasingly rely on automation. “At TRM, we’re building AI for problems that have real consequences for public safety, financial integrity, and national security,” wrote Esteban Castaño, co-founder and CEO of TRM Labs. “This funding allows our world-class team — and the people who will join us next — to innovate alongside institutions on the front lines of the most consequential threats, and expand the potential of AI to meaningfully improve how our critical systems are protected.” The $70 million round shows that capital is flowing into blockchain analytics platforms seeking to stop the spread of AI-fueled scams and cyberattacks, including from large traditional institutions.

The total value locked of tokenized RWAs on Avalanche rose 68.6% over the fourth quarter of 2025 and nearly 950% over the year to more than $1.3 billion, boosted by the $500 million BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) that launched in November, Messari research analyst Youssef Haidar said in a Jan. 29 report. Fortune 500 fintech FIS partnered with Avalanche-based marketplace Intain to launch tokenized loans in November, further boosting Avalanche’s TVL, Haidar said. Intain enables 2,000 US banks to securitize over $6 billion worth of loans on Avalanche. The S&P Dow Jones also partnered with Dinari, an Avalanche-powered blockchain, to launch the S&P Digital Markets 50 Index, which tracks 35 crypto-linked stocks and 15 crypto tokens on Avalanche.

The transaction involved token purchases at market prices with no discount and an extended lockup period and was settled entirely in Jupiter’s JupUSD stablecoin, the companies said. Financial terms beyond the $35 million investment were not disclosed. Source: Jupiter The investment comes as Jupiter has processed more than $1 trillion in trading volume over the past year and expanded beyond swap routing into perpetuals, lending and stablecoins, according to the company. The deal also included warrants allowing ParaFi Capital to acquire additional tokens at higher prices, a structure the companies said was intended to reflect long-term alignment. The investment follows a recent expansion of Jupiter’s product offerings. In October, Jupiter rolled out a beta version of its onchain prediction market developed with Kalshi, followed in January by the launch of JupUSD , a Solana-native, dollar-pegged stablecoin built in partnership with Ethena Labs. Jupiter’s native token ( JUP ) was up around 9% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov posted Tuesday on X that Avara, a company encompassing projects including the Family crypto wallet and previously the social media platform Lens, “is no longer required as we go all in on bringing Aave to the masses.” Kulechov said the Apple iOS-based Family crypto wallet was also being wound down as the team has “learned that onboarding millions of users requires purpose-built experiences, such as savings, rather than generic, open-ended wallet experiences.” The move marks Aave’s latest effort to refocus on products such as its flagship lending protocol as the project handed stewardship of Lens to the Mask Network last month, with Kulechov saying Aave’s participation in the protocol would be reduced to an advisory role so it can focus on DeFi . Source: Stani Kulechov Kulechov said in his latest post that Aave was “now united as one team of world-class designers, engineers, and smart contract experts, aligned around a single mission: bringing DeFi to everyone.” Continue reading Step Finance treasury wallets breached, $27M in SOL drained as STEP crashes 90% Step Finance, a decentralized finance portfolio tracker on Solana, disclosed a security breach that led to the compromise of several treasury wallets, triggering a sharp sell-off in its native token. “Earlier today, several of our treasury wallets were compromised by a sophisticated actor during APAC hours. This was an attack facilitated through a well-known attack vector,” the platform wrote in a post on X, adding that they have taken “remediation” steps. Onchain data reviewed by blockchain security firm CertiK shows that roughly 261,854 Solana ( SOL ) (worth around $27.2 million) was unstaked and transferred from Step Finance-controlled wallets. Step Finance has not yet confirmed the total scale of the losses.

The downturn was driven by investor fears over stagnating US liquidity following the nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, resulting in consecutive days of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs and over $2.5 billion in leveraged liquidations.

In corporate news, blockchain intelligence platform TRM Labs became a crypto unicorn after raising $70 million in a Series C round led by Blockchain Capital to combat AI-fueled cybercrime. Meanwhile, Avalanche saw a record high in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, boosted by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, and Solana-based Jupiter secured a $35 million strategic investment from ParaFi Capital.

Finally, Aave Labs announced it is winding down its umbrella brand "Avara" and phasing out the Family crypto wallet. The decision is part of a strategic shift to refocus entirely on decentralized finance (DeFi) and simplify the company’s branding structure.5e:Tbc3,Bitcoin is showing early signs of recovery after falling sharply in recent weeks. The world’s largest cryptocurrency bounced from around the $60,000 level and has moved modestly higher, giving investors some hope that the worst part of the recent correction may be ending. However, analysts say it is still too early to confirm that the market has fully stabilized. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up by more than 7% and is trading slightly below $70,000. Recovery Seen, But Confirmation Still Needed Bitcoin has already climbed more than 10% from its recent low, which is a positive signal for the market. Even so, experts explain that a stronger and more consistent upward move is needed before traders can confidently say that a new uptrend has started. Markets often show short-term rebounds during corrections, and sometimes prices can fall again before a true recovery begins. Because of this, many traders are carefully watching how Bitcoin behaves over the next few weeks. If buying demand continues to grow and prices keep rising steadily, it could confirm that a meaningful bottom has been formed. Possible February Rally in Focus Bitcoin could see a stronger rally later in February once the correction phase ends. One important level being watched is around $94,000, which is considered a key resistance area based on previous price movements. A move toward that level would mean strong recovery momentum, although it may not happen immediately. Downside Risk Still Exists Despite the recent bounce, risks remain. If selling pressure returns, Bitcoin could still fall toward the $55,000–$56,000 range, which is seen as the next important support zone. For now, the market remains mixed. Investors are waiting for clearer signs of sustained strength before making large moves, while long-term holders continue to focus on Bitcoin’s broader growth trend despite short-term volatility.

Market Fear Rises as XRP Metrics Turn Bearish XRP has been moving in line with the broader crypto market decline, with several indicators showing weakening momentum. On-chain data indicates that XRP exchange reserves recently climbed to around 2.7 billion tokens, meaning that some investors are moving holdings onto exchanges — often interpreted as a signal that traders may be preparing to sell. However, at the time of writing, XRP has gained more than 19% in the last 24 hours. Analysts warn that short-term rebounds could also turn into “bull traps,” where prices briefly rise before continuing lower, making timing the market difficult. Investors Urged to Wait for Confirmation Several experts have advised investors to avoid rushing into dip-buying strategies. Historically, sharp corrections can continue longer than expected, and analysts say confirmation of a sustained uptrend is often safer than trying to catch a “falling knife.” This approach shows the broader uncertainty in the crypto market, where sentiment indicators have recently slipped into extreme fear territory. Garlinghouse Quote Interpreted as Subtle Signal Amid the downturn, Garlinghouse shared the well-known Warren Buffett quote: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” My favorite Warren Buffet quote: "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful!" — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) February 5, 2026 While the Ripple CEO did not directly comment on XRP’s price, many traders interpreted the post as a possible signal encouraging long-term confidence during the market’s fear phase. Social media reactions from XRP supporters quickly framed the message as a reminder that major opportunities often appear during market stress. Long-Term Fundamentals Still in Focus Despite short-term bearish signals, XRP supporters continue pointing to Ripple’s ongoing institutional partnerships, payment-network expansion, and new use cases on the XRP Ledger as long-term drivers that could support the asset once broader market sentiment improves. For now, analysts say the coming months could determine whether the market stabilizes into a consolidation phase or experiences additional downside.

Several major altcoins have started a relief rally, which is expected to face selling at the moving averages. Bitcoin ( BTC ) recovered sharply above $69,000 after plunging to $60,000 on Friday, indicating solid buying at lower levels. BTC’s fall has hurt sentiment , pulling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to a score of 9 out of 100, the lowest since June 2022. The big question on traders’ minds is when the recovery may begin. Veteran trader Peter Brandt said in a post on X that the nature of the decline had “all the finger prints of campaign selling, not retail liquidation.” Brandt added that it was difficult to know when the pattern would end . Crypto market data daily view. Source: TradingView However, there is a positive ray of hope for the bulls. Market analyst Subu Trade said in a post on X that the relative strength index on the weekly chart has fallen below the 30 level. Such an event has happened only four times in the past and BTC has recorded a 23.34% average return after a month. Could BTC and the major altcoins start a sustained relief rally? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction BTC closed below the crucial $74,508 level on Wednesday and fell to the next major support at $60,000 on Friday. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The sharp fall of the past few days had pulled the relative strength index deep into the oversold territory. That suggests the selling may have been overdone in the near term, and a relief rally is possible. On the upside, the bears will attempt to defend the $74,508 level and flip it into resistance. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair may again tumble toward $60,000. The first sign of strength will be a close above $74,508. The Bitcoin price may then ascend to the 20-day exponential moving average ($80,899). Ether price prediction Ether ( ETH ) plunged below the critical $2,111 level on Thursday and reached the $1,750 support on Friday. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls are attempting to start a recovery off the $1,750 level, which is expected to face significant selling at the breakdown level of $2,111. If the Ether price turns down sharply from $2,111, it suggests that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That heightens the risk of a break below the $1,750 level. The next support on the downside is at $1,537. Instead, if buyers thrust the ETH/USDT pair above $2,111, it suggests that the bears are losing their grip. The pair may then climb to the 20-day EMA ($2,569). BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) closed below the $730 level on Wednesday and extended its decline to $570 on Friday. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The RSI sank deep into the oversold territory, indicating a possible bounce in the near term. A shallow rebound will signal a lack of aggressive buying by the bulls. That increases the risk of a break below $570. The BNB/USDT pair may then plummet to $500. Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them. They will have to swiftly push the BNB price above the $730 level to signal strength. If they do that, the pair may rally to the 20-day EMA ($798). XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) turned down sharply on Thursday, falling below the support line of the descending channel pattern and the Oct. 10, 2025, low of $1.25. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls aggressively purchased the dip and have pushed the XRP price back into the channel. The XRP/USDT pair may rally to the 20-day EMA ($1.71), which is expected to attract sellers. However, if buyers bulldoze their way above the 20-day EMA, the pair might surge to the downtrend line. On the other hand, if the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the sentiment remains negative. The bears will then again attempt to sink the pair below the support line. Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) extended its decline below the $95 support on Wednesday and fell to the $67.50 level on Friday. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The fall pulled the RSI deep into the oversold territory, improving the prospects of a short-term recovery. The SOL/USDT pair may reach the $95 level, where the sellers are expected to step in. If the price turns down sharply from $95, the risk of a break below the $67.50 level increases. On the other hand, if buyers achieve a close above $95, the Solana price is likely to rally to the 20-day EMA ($110). Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) remains under pressure, with the bears pulling the price below the psychological support of $0.10 on Thursday. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The DOGE/USDT pair is attempting to bounce off the $0.08 level, but the bears are expected to halt the relief rally at the 20-day EMA ($0.11). If the Dogecoin price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the pair may collapse to $0.07. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above the moving averages, it suggests that the bulls are back in the game. The pair may then surge toward the stiff overhead resistance at $0.16. Cardano price prediction Sellers pulled Cardano ( ADA ) below the support line of the descending channel pattern on Friday, but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price sustains above the support line, the bulls will attempt to push the ADA/USDT pair to the 20-day EMA ($0.32). Sellers will strive to defend the 20-day EMA and once again pull the price below the support line. If they succeed, the Cardano price might descend to $0.20 and then to $0.15. Contrarily, a close above the 20-day EMA suggests that the break below the support line may have been a bear trap. The pair may then challenge the downtrend line.

Bitcoin Cash price prediction Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($547) on Thursday, indicating a negative sentiment. BCH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers pulled the Bitcoin Cash price below the $443 support on Friday, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels. If the price sustains above $443, the BCH/USDT pair may ascend to the 20-day EMA. The bears are expected to fiercely defend the 20-day EMA, as a break above it suggests that the downtrend might be over. On the way down, a close below the $443 level signals the start of the next leg of the downtrend toward $380. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) is facing selling at the $35.50 level, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($29.78) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. If the price turns up from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $35.50. If they can pull it off, the HYPE/USDT pair is likely to soar to $44. Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bulls have given up. The Hyperliquid price may then consolidate between $35.50 and $20.82 for some time. Monero price prediction Monero ( XMR ) continued its downward march and collapsed below the $360 support on Thursday. XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls are attempting to start a relief rally, but the up move is expected to face selling at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $361. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will again try to resume the downtrend. If the $276 level gives way, the XMR/USDT pair may slump to $231. On the contrary, a rise above $361 opens the gates for a rally to the 50% retracement level of $388 and then to the 20-day EMA ($432).

Analysts point out that the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropping below 30 is a rare event that historically precedes significant gains, suggesting a potential relief rally. However, BTC faces a critical hurdle at the $74,508 breakdown level, which bulls must reclaim to signal a sustained recovery toward $80,899.

Major altcoins including Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also initiated relief rallies from their recent oversold conditions. While technical indicators like the RSI suggest buying pressure is emerging, these assets are expected to encounter selling pressure at their 20-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and previous breakdown levels. Success depends on whether buyers can overcome these resistances; failure could result in continued downward pressure towards lower support zones.62:T1764,Crypto's eligibility for 401k retirement funds is under fire after brutal market rout wipes out $2 trillion "401ks exist to help people save for a secure retirement, not gamble on speculative assets," said an industry observer. Feb 6, 2026, 6:44 p.m. Bitcoin’s 50% plunge from its October peak has done more than just erase $2 trillion in market value — it has reignited a fierce debate over the fiduciary math of the American retirement system. As investors scramble to parse the drivers of the latest crash, industry observers are asking if volatile digital assets have any business being in a $12.5 trillion 401(k) market designed for stability. STORY CONTINUES BELOW “If investors want to speculate on crypto, they are welcome to do so on their own. 401ks exist to help people save for a secure retirement, not gamble on speculative assets with no intrinsic value,” said Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at the Duke Financial Economics Center and a co-host of the Coffee & Crypto podcast . U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in August that allowed 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plans access to alternative assets, including digital assets. Even Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Paul Atkins said last week , just on the eve of the latest brutal crypto selloff , that “the time is right” to open up the retirement market to crypto. But the recent rout in crypto might just turn retirement fund managers away from plans to add crypto to 401(k)s. Reiners said that several large crypto companies, such as Coinbase (COIN), are already included in major equity indices, which means many 401(k) plans already have indirect exposure to crypto, and that should be enough. “Unless Congress changes the law, plan sponsors are unlikely to include crypto, or ETFs, as plan options because they don't want to be sued by their employees. For any employers that were considering it, I'm sure recent events have them reconsidering," Reiners said. The problem with putting people's life savings into crypto is that the industry is relatively young and extremely volatile, and pension funds are for stable growth. Buying and holding can work for assets like the S&P 500, which sees large volatility mostly during Black Swan events, such as the 2008 financial crisis or COVID-19 uncertainties. However, given the size of traditional markets, the government often steps in to stop the bleeding, and numerous regulatory frameworks exist to protect people's investments. But for crypto, much of its activity is just speculation, and that means prices can see extreme swings over a weekend or a week, which can quickly decimate billions in value with no regulatory oversight over market moves. This makes it even more nerve-wracking for investors to put their life savings into it. Didn't 'get out quickly' To put the uncertainty in perspective, many firms were likely blindsided by the sudden crash in bitcoin and crypto over the last few days. In fact, the recent brutal selloff was so violent and sudden that BlockTrust IRA , an AI-powered retirement platform that has added $70 million in IRA funds in the past 12 months, was caught in the bloodbath. “Sometimes we look at things that we say, ‘you know what, we should get out,’ and sometimes we don't. And last week, we did not get out as quickly because a lot of the underlying fundamental data we're looking at is still very strong,” Chief Technical Officer Maximilian Pace said in an interview with CoinDesk. However, concerning the sudden selloff, Pace pointed to the firm’s “broad sense of analytics,” which operates effectively over longer timelines than short-term trading. That strategy helped it outperform in 2025, and the firm added that it is “not necessarily wavered by volatility.” The AI trading firm’s Animus Fund outperformed bitcoin throughout 2025 and was up 27% from January to December 2025, while the bitcoin buy-and-hold strategy was down 6% to 13% over the same period, the firm said in a press release. In Pace's view, zooming out and considering crypto investments over a five- to 10-year time horizon is the right way to think about 401(k) plans. “You would be better thinking like a venture capitalist rather than like a day trader,” Pace said. “There are ways of de-risking the investment, either from a time perspective or from a strategy perspective, that make it more attractive or more acceptable for things like 401(k) programs. But like anything, there's risk.” The future of pensions Perhaps there’s a need to zoom out further and think about the actual blockchain technology for retirement investment management than just putting money into tokens. Robert Crossley, Franklin Templeton's global head of industry and digital advisory services, is thinking exactly that. The retirement industry, which he says is siloed, slow-moving and over-regulated, could be revolutionized by onchain wallets that hold tokenized assets. And by doing so, an individual's digital wealth will be much more aligned with the rest of their lives, Crossley said. "Whether you are a saver, an investor, a spender, you have all of these different financial activities which are currently serviced very differently by different providers in your life," Crossley said in an interview. If regulations come into play that don't prohibit innovations, it is very likely that blockchain technology can eliminate such fragmentation of intermediaries. It's possible that industry could see a supply of wallets that "unlock the possibility of programmable assets and securities and the ability to see all of your assets in one place and control them directly, rather than being intermediated,” he said. “When something becomes tokenized, it becomes software. That software can be an asset, but it also could be a benefit, it also could be a liability. It could be a whole 401(k). It could be your whole DC [defined contribution] plan,” Crossley said.63:T49c,Bitcoin’s recent 50% plunge, which erased $2 trillion in market value, has reignited a fierce debate over whether volatile digital assets belong in 401(k) retirement plans. Critics argue that these funds are designed for long-term stability rather than gambling on speculative assets like Bitcoin, and fiduciary concerns regarding potential lawsuits may discourage plan sponsors from including them. Despite previous regulatory encouragement from the Trump administration and SEC Chair Paul Atkins, the lack of intrinsic value and extreme volatility in the crypto market pose significant risks to pension funds.

However, some industry players believe that strategies exist to make crypto viable for retirement portfolios. Maximilian Pace of BlockTrust IRA suggests adopting a long-term "venture capitalist" mindset to weather volatility, while Robert Crossley of Franklin Templeton proposes focusing on the underlying blockchain technology. Crossley envisions a future where tokenization and onchain wallets revolutionize the retirement industry by eliminating intermediaries and allowing for programmable assets, rather than simply exposing savers to token price fluctuations.64:Tadb,การที่ราคา Bitcoin ดิ่งลง 50% และการระเหยของมูลค่าตลาดไปกว่า 2 ล้านล้านดอลลาร์ ทำให้เกิดการถกเถียงอีกครั้งเกี่ยวกับความเหมาะสมของสินทรัพย์ดิจิทัลในแผน 401(k) นักวิจารณ์มองว่ากองทุนเกษียณควรมุ่งเน้นความมั่นคงระยะยาว ไม่ใช่การพนันกับสินทรัพย์เสี่ยงเช่น Bitcoin และความกังวลด้านความรับผิดชอบต่อหน้าที่อาจทำให้ผู้ดูแลแผนประกันละเลยการลงทุนในสินทรัพย์เหล่านี้เพื่อหลีกเลี่ยงการฟ้องร้อง แม้จะมีการสนับสนุนจากทางการในอดีต แต่ความผันผวนสูงและการขาดโครงสร้างกำกับดูแลถือเป็นความเสี่ยงสำคัญต่อกองทุนบำเหน็จบำนาญ

Bithumb, one of Korea’s leading centralized exchanges (CEX), made a multi-billion dollar mistake overnight when management accidentally sent 2,000 BTC, worth almost $140 million, to more than 200 users instead of 2,000 WON, which is worth less than $1.5. As users received the BTC, they immediately attempted to sell and offramp funds, briefly sending BTC on Bithumb almost 18% below the market price according to LookOnchain. BTC/KRW on Bithumb - LookOnchain The exchange addressed the situation in a notice that read, “During today's event payment process, an abnormal amount of Bitcoin was paid to some customers. As sales were made on some accounts that received the Bitcoin, the Bitcoin price temporarily fluctuated rapidly. Bithumb immediately recognized abnormal transactions through its internal control system and quickly restricted transactions to related accounts.” Korean outlet The Chosun Daily broke the news and said that “most” of the 240 users who partook in Bithumb’s Random Box promo event received 2,000 BTC in each of their wallets, and roughly $3 billion was withdrawn from the exchange. According to the local news outlet, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) in Korea are actively investigating the incident due to its magnitude. The exact number of BTC distributed has not been disclosed, but based on information provided by Chosun, the airdrop could have been worth up to $30 billion.66:Teb1,In brief Strategy stock rose 18% to $126.59 despite being 9.5% underwater on its 713,502 BTC treasury. BitMine shares jumped 13.9% to $19.83, with plans to earn $1M daily from staking 4.28M ETH. Coinbase gained 9.9% to $160.60 as volatility drives higher trading volumes and transaction revenue. Bitcoin juggernaut Strategy , Ethereum giant BitMine Immersion Technologies, and crypto exchange Coinbase all looked much more verdant Friday as the price of BTC stabilized after dropping 14% on Thursday. Strategy, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, had gained 22% since the opening bell and was recently changing hands for $131. The company holds 713,502 BTC in its treasury, which was acquired for an average price of $76,047. But after BTC took a plunge yesterday, the Virginia software company is now underwater on its BTC stash. Bitcoin was recently trading for $69,500 after stabilizing since yesterday's dive. It has gained nearly 6% in the past day, but is still 16% lower than it was this time last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. The price of Bitcoin fell as low as $60,225 on Thursday, CoinGecko data shows. MSTR reported a $12.4 billion Q4 loss during its earnings call late Thursday afternoon. “Strategy has built a digital fortress anchored by 713,502 Bitcoin, and our shift to digital credit, which aligns with our indefinite Bitcoin horizon," Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said in a statement to shareholders. But at least two analysts have tempered their optimism for the firm. Canacord Genuity analyst Joseph Vafi cut his price forecast for MSTR by 60%, from $474 to $185; BTIG analyst Andrew Harte made a similar price forecast cut, from $630 to $250. Both analysts maintained their buy ratings, though, saying that there's still significant upside for investors. Meanwhile, Tom Lee's BitMine—the only Ethereum treasury to have added more ETH to its coffers in January—has seen its share price jump 15% to about $20 since the New York open. The company commands a treasury of 4,285,125 ETH that's worth about $8.7 billion at current prices. At the time of writing, BMNR was sitting on a $7.5 billion unrealized loss. But Ethreum treasuries work a little differently than their Bitcoin counterparts. BMNR has staked $6.7 billion worth of its ETH. Lee said last week that when the company has fully staked its ETH through MAVAN and its staking partners, it will be earning more than $1 million per day in rewards via the Ethereum network. Coinbase has also staged a comeback, seeing its price rise 10% to $161 at the time of writing. Coinbase, which trades under the COIN ticker on the Nasdaq, tends to stabilize quickly during turbulent markets. That's because volatility that leads to high trading volumes bolsters the bottom line for Coinbase, Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas said previously. "The increase in volatility had a meaningful impact on our transaction revenue," she said in February 2024, right after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading in the U.S. "We saw strong growth and reengagement from both simple and advanced traders. Notable average trading volumes materially increased among our advanced traders." Other major crypto stocks surging Friday include Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings and CleanSpark, both up more than 19% to recent prices of $8.06 and $9.87 respectively, with miners Terawulf and Riot Platforms up nearly as much on the day. And institutional crypto firm Galaxy Digital is up more than 17% on the day to a price of nearly $20 after seeing its shares dive earlier this week following an earnings loss.

Despite the company’s Bitcoin treasury sitting nearly $100 million underwater, Webley rejected the idea of capitulation. The founder of The Smarter Web Company Plc (SWC) has told Bloomberg that he would rather sell his own arm before selling Bitcoin. HOT Stories "Hotel California" According to a recent report by Tokenize Capital, many DATs are now "zombie companies," forcing them to sell assets just to keep the lights on.

Earlier today, X users noted that Bithumb’s listed BTC/South Korean Won (KRW) trading pair plummeted by 10% in the space of a minute before returning to its original price. The account “Definalist,” which claims to be made up of five crypto traders based in China, noted the price drop and a “rumor” that someone dumped 2,000 BTC. They also appeared to show a screenshot taken from the seller’s account while they were dumping the BTC, which in today’s less-than-stellar crypto markets would fetch $134 million . In today’s less-than-stellar crypto markets, the dumped BTC would be worth $134 million.

Bithumb confirms it sent ‘abnormal’ sums of BTC to users Bithumb has since confirmed some details of the incident, although it didn’t confirm the quantity of BTC nor the number of customers who received mistaken disbursements. It admitted that an “abnormal” sum of BTC was paid to various users, and that BTC’s price “temporarily fluctuated sharply as some accounts that received the BTC sold it.” It notes that it was able to restrict the accounts selling the BTC and added that “the market price returned to normal levels within five minutes, and the domino liquidation prevention system functioned normally, preventing chain liquidations due to the abnormal BTC price.” “We want to make it clear that this incident is unrelated to any external hacking or security breach, and does not pose any issues with system security or customer asset management,” the exchange said. If Bithumb did in fact send 2,000 BTC to at least 100 users, thats a minimum distribution of $13 billion . BTC crashed almost 47% from its all-time high of $126,000 last October but has, for the time being, gradually begun to increase in price again.

Outflows from US crypto funds topped $434 million. Reasons for the crash are myriad. A version of this article appeared in our The Roundup newsletter on February 6. Sign up here. BlackRock just notched a new record for one of its winningest funds . This time, the reason was less than bullish. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which trades under the ticker IBIT, broke $10 billion in trading volume amid Thursday’s market crash. Looking more closely, that trading action was mostly from investors selling, as one would imagine when an asset plummets 20% in a week. Indeed, more than $434 million exited various US-based crypto funds yesterday, according to SoSoValue . BlackRock’s fund made up roughly 40% of that, followed by Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund. Data for other funds paint an equally frantic picture. CoinShares analyst James Butterfill reported that crypto products recorded $18.5 billion in trading volume on Thursday — the largest ever. Today, Bitcoin trades at roughly $67,400 after briefly falling below $60,000 on some trading platforms early Friday morning. And with the latest price action, the $1.3 trillion cryptocurrency officially gave up all its gains since pro-crypto US President Donald Trump was elected in 2024. Bitcoin wasn’t the only cryptocurrency to fall. Ether fell below $2,000 on Thursday, while other leading altcoins posted crashes of more than 20% this past week. The reasons are myriad, and unlike previous crashes, don’t hinge on the collapse of a large centralised exchange or a depegging stablecoin. In fact, it looks a lot like general market skittishness stemming from weak US jobs data. “It is likely a mix of tech equities being over extended while Bitcoin is failing its ‚safe-haven‘ test and being very sensitive to risk asset pricing,” Kaiko analyst Laurens Fraussen told DL News. He added that Bitcoin will likely trade between $60,000 and $70,000 for the time being. “The silver lining right now is that most of the aggressive selling is likely done,” Fraussen said.

Futures open interest has dropped to $49 billion from $61 billion in just one week. The selloff has been driven by deleveraging rather than a single liquidation event. Bitcoin price crash isn’t triggered by a single catastrophic event. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, identified the five key factors that pulled the top crypto to $60,000 on Thursday. The list reveals a market under siege from multiple directions. Collapsing leverage, miners forced to sell, AI hype unravelling, quantum computing risks, and the typical four-year boom-bust cycle patterns that Bitcoin investors expect and sell into. But unlike past crashes with clear culprits — FTX imploding, China’s mining ban, Terra’s collapse — this selloff has no single trigger. That makes it harder to call a bottom, but it can also create a cleaner setup for a recovery, Sigel said. Massive deleveraging Bitcoin futures open interest has plummeted to about $49 billion today from roughly $61 billion one week ago, according to Coinglass data. That’s a decline of more than 20% in borrowed bets against Bitcoin. Open interest reveals how much borrowed money is being bet on Bitcoin’s price movements and indicates whether investors are getting more aggressive or pulling back from risk. More dramatically, futures open interest peaked above $90 billion in early October, meaning the market has now shed over 45% of peak leverage. Bitcoin’s price has declined by a similar amount over the same period. That parallel drop suggests leverage and price fell together, rather than triggering a chaotic collapse in which forced selling spirals out of control. Over the past week, crypto markets experienced approximately $3 to $4 billion in total liquidations, with an estimated $2 to $2.5 billion concentrated in Bitcoin futures, according to Coinglass. AI trade collapse Investors are now questioning whether companies like OpenAI and cloud providers can actually execute and profit from their massive infrastructure spending plans, Sigel argued. Investors are questioning AI because the returns on tens of billions spent on infrastructure remain uncertain, and monetisation is still a bit murky. That scepticism has hit Bitcoin miners particularly hard. Many mining companies pivoted to AI and high-performance computing, betting they could repurpose their facilities and capitalise on the AI boom . But, as financing dried up and Bitcoin prices fell, miners had to rush out to sell Bitcoin to raise cash and keep their operations running. “As financing conditions tightened alongside Bitcoin weakness, miners faced increased pressure to sell Bitcoin to bolster balance sheets, adding incremental spot supply during a fragile market moment,” Sigel wrote. But the timing couldn’t be worse. Miners are dumping Bitcoin to fund AI pivots just as those AI bets look increasingly shaky. Governance concerns resurface The Trump family’s World Liberty Finance project has sparked new concerns about transparency in crypto after they sold a significant stake to UAE-linked investors. A Wall Street Journal report on January 31 revealed that the crypto project sold nearly half of World Liberty Finance for an undisclosed $500 million to a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family around the time that Donald Trump took office in January 2025. “Ironically, these are precisely the types of issues the Clarity Act is designed to address through standardized disclosure and reporting requirements, which would reduce uncertainty and improve market confidence,” Sigel wrote. Quantum computing fears The threat surrounding quantum computing has also reached a fever pitch. “Investor interest in the topic has increased, and discussion across developer and community forums has become more active, even as several Bitcoin Core developers continue to downplay the immediacy of these risks,” Sigel said. Quantum computers are machines with enough power to break Bitcoin’s encryption model. Anywhere between 20% and 50% of circulating coins are at risk, according to a report from Chaincode Labs. Sigel noted an irony, however. Stocks of quantum computing companies have also crashed alongside Bitcoin and other risk assets. Four-year cycle psychology Every four years, Bitcoin has followed a strict yet unofficial schedule. Bitcoin’s halving event reduces the issuance of new coins, which typically triggers a rise in prices after.. As prices increase, investors take profits, and the price slams into a bear market. “The four-year cycle narrative remains an important reference point for investor psychology,” Sigel wrote. But the path from peak to trough is rarely linear. Past cycles have produced multiple moments after a crash when investors buy up new coins that proved durable enough to support sizable counter-trend rallies. To be sure, many market watchers claimed that the four-year cycle was over . Despite the five negative factors, Sigel sees opportunity. “The depth of the drawdown and the degree of leverage reset have made the current price washout increasingly attractive for building positions on a one- to two-year view,” Sigel wrote. “I’ve been adding to spot Bitcoin today.” Pedro Solimano is a markets correspondent based in Buenos Aires.

While the e-commerce giant’s earnings fell in line with Wall Street expectations, it was its capital expenditure preview for 2026 that scared investors. Indeed, Amazon plans to invest $200 billion in AI and other technologies in 2026, leading to a drop in its stock after mixed earnings results. The company’s capital expenditure forecast has raised concerns among investors, reflecting broader trends in the tech sector. Amazon (AMZN) stock is currently experiencing a bearish outlook, as the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report projected a staggering $200B AI spending segment. The firm shared how it expects its capital expenditures to continue surging as it heavily pivots towards data centers and infrastructure to cater to its rising AI demand. “With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low-earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026 and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital,” CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement . The announcement was met with a mix of strikingly bearish reviews, with investors skeptical about the firm’s plan to spend $200B to embrace AI. Investor sentiment is cautious, as Amazon’s (AMZN) stock decline reflects worries over its capital expenditure plans and competitive positioning in the AI sector. Current analyst price targets range from $244 to $340, suggesting potential upside from the current market price of $246.29.

Sellers stayed in control for most of this week too. This, after each bullish attempt was neutralized by aggressive sellers during the previous crypto market shake-up. The altcoin’s price action kept printing lower lows all along as the momentum clearly leaned in favour of market bears. However, it’s worth noting that the bearish momentum has been losing strength recently. Aggressive buyers shows up at a key level On the daily charts, NEAR’s $0.855 support zone was winked strongly as aggressive buyers stepped in fast to invest the dip. The daily candle closed strong with a long lower wick, indicating that a potential reversal could be on cards. Over the last few weeks, sellers have been in control. However, upon retesting the $0.855 support zone, buyers absorbed the selling pressure aggressively. NEAR’s price action has gained some bullishness since then too. Such a reaction is often indicative of short-term exhaustion from bears. Source: TradingView Momentum indicators flash early recovery signs That is not all since momentum indicators may be starting to align too. The Stochastic RSI dropped deep into oversold territory – A sign that selling pressure could be nearing an end, while affirming the likelihood of a looming reversal ahead. The Stochastic RSI does not guarantee a reversal, but it increases the odds of a relief move. Put simply, the altcoin’s price action and momentum may be aligning with the market’s bullish bias. Volume and social metrics back the move Narrowing down to the on-chain metrics, NEAR’s trading volume has also risen significantly during the bounce. Figures for the same recorded a hike of $97 million to hit $453 million at press time. That matters since it is a sign of real participation across the board. Not a weak, low-liquidity move. Source: Santiment At the same time, NEAR’s social dominance has picked up too. More traders are talking about the token again. From a similar scenario in the past, the alignment of positive momentum and spiking social dominance accelerated the altcoin’s bullish advancements. The same could come into play here and accelerate NEAR’s bullish momentum. Source: Santiment Levels and zones to look out for The $0.855-zone is now critical. Bulls need to hold this level. A sustained defense could allow NEAR to push towards nearby resistance levels, probably to hunt the liquidity cluster worth 264k at around the $1.08-price level. On the other hand, a failure for the support level to hold would reopen the door to a further bearish run. Source: Coinglass At the time of writing, the balance seemed to be shifting. While the bears may be losing control, bulls are still only testing the waters. The next few trading sessions will be key. Follow-through will decide whether this is a temporary bounce or the start of a broader trend shift. Final Thoughts NEAR bounced strongly on the charts after testing the $0.855 demand zone. Oversold indicators and rising activity hinted at a possible trend shift.6d:T10b3,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and most cryptocurrencies are struggling with overwhelmingly negative market sentiment , XRP appears to be the only coin on which investors have suddenly turned bullish. Despite crashing below $1.4 this week, new reports indicate that XRP’s market sentiment is moving into positive territory, suggesting investor confidence in the token is shifting amid broader market weakness . XRP Sentiment Turns Positive As Bitcoin And Ethereum Struggle Bitcoin and Ethereum are facing intense bearish pressure , with market sentiment around the two largest cryptocurrencies remaining negative. Despite the broader market pullback, sentiment readings on XRP are unexpectedly positive. Recent data from crypto analytics platform Santiment show that, as of January 7, 2026, Bitcoin’s negative sentiment has dropped to 1.39, and Ethereum’s has fallen to 1.73, reflecting growing fear and uncertainty among investors amid the broader crypto downturn. Santiment’s chart indicates that market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum had steadily deteriorated since the beginning of the year. Source: Santiment Although Ethereum’s sentiment briefly rose to 2.12 in early January as the price attempted several recoveries, market perception quickly reversed and plunged as the cryptocurrency continued to decline. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown minimal improvement in market psychology, with sentiment remaining firmly in negative territory since the beginning of January. The cryptocurrency’s recent breakdown below $70,000 has further intensified bearish readings, fueling concerns among market watchers that it may now be in a full-scale bear market, with additional near-term downside pressure expected. This substantial decline in sentiment for Bitcoin and Ethereum highlights XRP’s unusual bullish position in the market. Given that its price crashed below $1.3 at the time of writing, market sentiment for XRP was widely expected to remain negative. However, against all odds, the cryptocurrency has managed to regain investors’ positive outlook and confidence. Santiment data shows that XRP’s market sentiment rose to 4.07 on January 7, up from 1.39 the day before. Since the beginning of January, the cryptocurrency’s sentiment has remained below 2, reflecting significant caution and uncertainty among investors ahead of the recent unexpected change. The rise in XRP’s positive sentiment is largely attributed to growing institutional demand for the cryptocurrency’s Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). While Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to experience outflows, XRP ETFs are the only products showing gains. Data from SoSoValue shows that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have posted only two days of positive inflows since January 16, with the most recent daily outflow totaling $434.15 million on February 5. Ethereum ETFs have faced similar losses , registering positive inflows on only three occasions since January 20. It recorded its largest outflow this year on January 21, when approximately $297.51 million left the asset. Meanwhile, XRP Spot ETFs have outperformed , recording only four days of outflows since the beginning of January, reflecting growing confidence and a shift in institutional interest toward the cryptocurrency.

HBAR and XLM eye key levels, helped by Bitcoin’s swift rebound to $70,000. Analysts warn that prices may yet dip after the latest relief rally. HBAR and XLM are up double digits as cryptocurrencies look for a swift rebound following Thursday’s steep crash that saw over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions wiped out. The altcoins are up as Bitcoin, which crashed to $60,000 amid the bloodbath, leads the recovery with a rebound to above $70,000. Gains for Hedera and Stellar mirror the sharp upticks for XRP, Flare, VeChain, and Kaspa. Ethereum, which dipped to near $1,700 on Thursday, was testing the resistance at $2,000. HBAR and XLM price gains Hedera’s token dropped to lows of $0.073 as top coins crashed late Thursday, but currently hovers above $0.093 as buyers eye the $0.10 mark given up this week. An uptick of over 15% in the past 24 hours amid a 65% surge in trading volume (to over $420 million) signals the strong buying that follows the latest dip. Bulls will eye year-to-date highs of $0.13, likely if market sentiment improves further. Stellar, which has tracked gains by XRP in the past, also jumped on Friday. The altcoin was up 10% at the time of writing, slightly off the mark seen with a 13% uptick during early US trading hours. XRP’s 18% spike as prices touched $1.52 following a dump to $1.13 pulled the closely related XLM higher. CoinMarketCap data showed Stellar traded around $0.17, sharply up from the lows of $0.13 reached earlier in the day. XLM was inching higher on increased volume, which details indicate stood at a 24-hour high of $426 million. Stellar bulls had helped push the daily volume up by more than 56% over this period. While sentiment remains well within the extreme fear territory, analysts say a break to $0.20 could allow for fresh bullish momentum. Bitcoin tops $70,000 as cryptocurrencies rebound Bitcoin (BTC) is spearheading the crypto sector’s latest quest for a swift turnaround following a sharp crash. The huge leverage unwinding saw BTC fall to $60,000, with a $10,000 drop in 24 hours marking the biggest one-day rout since bears annihilated bulls during the FTX crash in 2022. Gains have come as open interest expands, with shorts covering positions and fueling the climb to the critical $70,000 support level. Daily RSI also shows a bullish divergence. Bitcoin price chart by TradingView CoinShares says record ETP volumes, pause in whale selling, and BTC price moving below miners’ production costs are factors that have historically marked fresh accumulation “rather than the start of a new leg lower.” However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital says bulls may yet have to take on bears. The analyst shared his BTC price forecast as the cryptocurrency market bounced from Thursday’s crash. According to Rekt Capital, a potential bearish acceleration is likely after another relief rally, with this based on Bitcoin’s historical chart patterns. “History suggests there’s more downside to come,” he shared on X . Bitcoin traded around $71,190 at the time of writing.6f:T62d,In a video interview, Samson Mow shares his views on Bitcoin's latest bloodbath, quantum fears and the catalysts that could drive Bitcoin’s next recovery. In an exclusive Cointelegraph interview, Bitcoin OG Samson Mow shares his perspective on Bitcoin’s latest massive crash, what’s driving the sell-offs and why a rebound could be closer than most expect. We discuss gold and silver’s rally, forced liquidations, the “quantum threat” to crypto, and examine the long-term Bitcoin thesis: Is Bitcoin truly designed to rise in price due to fiat devaluation, or is that a flawed narrative? After months of relentless selling pressure, sharp liquidations and growing bearish sentiment, many investors are asking the same question: Why does Bitcoin keep falling despite strong fundamentals, and when could it finally recover? According to Mow, Bitcoin’s unique role as the most liquid asset in global markets, combined with its 24/7 tradability, makes it particularly sensitive to downside shocks that more traditional assets often avoid, at least in the short term. The discussion also explores one of the most important dynamics in today’s market: the relationship between gold, silver and Bitcoin. After a powerful rally in precious metals, Mow lays out the case for why capital rotation from other hard assets may be setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next move.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.70:T9f7,Ripple's token has also surpassed BNB in terms of market cap after its sublime surge. It was just hours ago, less than a day, when we wrote about XRP’s spectacular collapse as the asset plummeted to $1.11 for the first time since before the US presidential elections at the end of 2024. This meant that it had shed over 50% of its value in a month as it peaked at $2.40 on January 6. Oh, how the landscape in crypto can change in hours sometimes, not even days or weeks. What happened with XRP’s price since that local low has been nothing short of amazing. There were some signs about a potential rebound, such as the plummeting RSI metric, but even the most vocal XRP bulls were probably surprised by the extent of the rally. After all, the cross-border token skyrocketed by 37% in about 18 hours – going from the aforementioned low to $1.54 before it faced some resistance and now trades around $1.50. This still represents a 34% surge in less than a day. Santiment also weighed in on the token’s performance. The analysts acknowledged XRP’s rise in terms of market cap as well, as it now sits above BNB as the fourth-largest crypto asset. They blamed the massive price pump in the past several hours on the overall network stability and growing activity on the XRP Ledger. Moreover, they showcased a chart indicating that Ripple whales went on an accumulation spree, with almost 1,400 separate $100K+ whale transactions (the highest in four months). 📈 Crypto markets are rebounding, but $XRP ‘s price has been on a particularly huge tear.

Feb 6, 2026, 5:54 p.m. Latest developments: In an interview with CoinDesk Live from the Ondo Summit, Ondo President Ian de Bode says 2025 marked a breakout year for its core businesses. The firm is now a leading issuer in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, with more than $2 billion in total value locked, according to president Ian De Bode. Its Global Markets platform for tokenized stocks and ETFs has reached roughly $600 million in TVL, giving Ondo about 60% market share in that niche, De Bode said. Ondo also highlighted partnerships with traditional finance heavyweights including Mastercard and JPMorgan. The context: Tokenization is still early, and revenue is not yet the primary focus. De Bode described the current phase as a “land grab,” with banks, asset managers and custodians racing to get assets on-chain. He said the priority is building scalable infrastructure — “the pipes” — before monetization fully kicks in. Even at current scale, Ondo’s tokenized products remain tiny relative to traditional finance markets, he added. Why it matters: Ondo is positioning itself beyond asset issuance and toward services. The company announced Ondo Perps, a new platform for perpetual futures on equities and commodities. Unlike existing venues that rely solely on stablecoins, Ondo Perps will allow tokenized stocks and ETFs to be posted as collateral, De Bode said. That design is meant to attract market makers, deepen liquidity and enable more sophisticated trading strategies. Driving demand: Retail adoption outside the U.S. is already showing up. De Bode said Ondo’s tokenized stocks platform has seen net inflows on all but three days since launching in September. Distribution through crypto wallets and exchanges — including Binance Wallet and a newly announced MetaMask integration — is accelerating uptake, particularly in Asia. He argued tokenized stocks solve real access problems globally, similar to how stablecoins expanded access to U.S. dollars. What comes next: Ondo’s long-term ambition is on-chain prime brokerage. Perpetuals are just the first step toward recreating traditional prime brokerage services on-chain, De Bode said. The broader thesis is convergence: investors will want a single app to trade crypto, stocks, ETFs and derivatives around the clock. Ondo plans to partner with centralized exchanges and wallets to make tokenized traditional assets native to crypto trading workflows.

Self-custodial Ethereum wallet Rainbow debuted its native token RNBW yesterday, Feb. 5. But the project’s token generation event (TGE) on Base , and the token’s debut for trading across exchanges, were met with reports of delayed distribution to ICO participants, which contributed to the token’s poor day-one performance. RNBW/USD 15-minute chart, Feb. 5-6. Source: Coinbase According to Coinbase data , RNBW hit a high of $0.05 on its first day of trading, but fell quickly and closed the daily session around $0.034, down more than 30%, putting its fully diluted valuation around $34 million. That left most bettors on Polymarket scrambling , having expected the FDV to hit roughly $100 million just a day after the TGE. Today, RNBW fell further, trading around $0.032 by press time, making its FDV around $32.17 million. ICO Investors in the Red The price is far below what early buyers paid. Rainbow conducted its initial coin offering (ICO) in mid-December 2025 via CoinList, where investors were offered RNBW at $0.1 per token. The sale saw 30 million RNBW tokens, or 3% of total supply, sold at an FDV of $100 million, meaning participants in that sale are now down more than 65% on their investments. For U.S. investors, the situation could be even worse as their full token unlock won’t happen until December of this year, according to CoinList’s terms and conditions. Back in 2022, Rainbow raised $18 million in a Series A funding round led by Seven Seven Six, the VC firm from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, bringing total funding to $21 million. The multi-chain wallet is known for its rewards program and gamification, where users can earn points for their on-chain activity. The firm explicitly connected RNBW with its points system when it first announced the token in September, and later specified that users who earned points in the wallet were eligible for a token airdrop. ‘No Better Day for TGE’ The token’s drop came amid a broader market bloodbath that wiped out $2.6 billion in liquidations in a single day. Total crypto market capitalization fell to $2.3 trillion as Bitcoin slid toward $60,000, reaching roughly 50% below its all-time high of $126,080, set in October. Soon after its TGE, Rainbow’s cofounder Mike Demarais indicated in an X post that some users had not received their claimed tokens, explaining “it’s because our backend token indexer has been getting slammed.” As frustration over the messy launch mounted, Rainbow CEO Alex LaPrade took to X on Thursday evening eastern time to say he still believes “there was no better day for TGE than today,” noting that the project had planned to launch its token on Feb. 5 back in December. LaPrade added: “TGE isn’t the finish line. Having a token live in market brings more scrutiny — both positive and negative.” But the CEO’s public statement didn’t succeed in calming all investors. Some quickly fired back at the CEO, accusing the project of late token distribution to CoinList pre-sale participants, as well as to points earners, calling it a scam and demanding refunds. Last year, MetaMask confirmed that it has plans to launch its own token, after years of hinting and speculation .73:T407,Rainbow wallet’s native token RNBW plummeted over 65% below its ICO price on its first day of trading, marred by technical issues and a harsh market environment. After debuting on the Base network, the token hit a high of $0.05 but quickly fell to around $0.032, resulting in a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of roughly $32 million. This price action left ICO participants, who purchased tokens at $0.10 via CoinList in mid-December, facing significant losses, with U.S. investors facing additional waiting periods for token unlocks.

The launch was plagued by delayed token distribution attributed to an overwhelmed backend token indexer, causing frustration among investors and airdrop recipients. Despite the broader market downturn that wiped out billions in liquidations and pushed Bitcoin toward $60,000, Rainbow CEO Alex LaPrade defended the timing of the Token Generation Event (TGE). However, the failed to appease all investors, many of whom took to social media to accuse the project of being a scam and demand refunds.74:T132d,Solana’s price has rebounded from key support, but weak volume and heavy overhead resistance raise the risk that the current rally is only a temporary dead cat bounce. Summary $70 high-timeframe support triggered the bounce , but structure remains bearish Price is entering major resistance near $87 , with VWAP and Fibonacci confluence Low volume weakens the rally , raising rejection and downside rotation risk Solana ( SOL ) price action has staged a short-term recovery after respecting a major high-timeframe support zone near $70. While the bounce has provided brief relief following sustained selling pressure, the broader technical picture suggests caution is warranted. The recent advance has occurred on below-average volume and is now approaching a dense cluster of resistance, increasing the probability that this move may be corrective rather than the start of a sustained trend reversal. As Solana trades higher into key technical barriers, market participants are closely watching whether buyers can generate enough momentum to shift structure, or whether sellers will reassert control and rotate price back toward recent lows. Solana price key technical points $70 high-timeframe support has held , triggering a short-term bounce Current price is entering major resistance confluence , including VWAP and Fibonacci Low volume undermines the rally , increasing dead cat bounce risk SOLUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a higher-timeframe perspective, the $70 level has proven to be a significant area of demand for Solana. This zone has acted as a structural support level, and the recent defense of this region allowed price to stabilize and push higher on the intraday timeframe. Following the bounce, Solana reclaimed its local point of control, signaling short-term acceptance and encouraging a brief bullish reaction. However, while the bounce itself is technically valid, it must be viewed within the context of the broader trend. Solana remains in a bearish market structure, and isolated rallies from support do not automatically imply a trend reversal, particularly when other confirming signals are absent. Resistance confluence caps the upside As the price moved higher, Solana is now trading into a well-defined resistance zone around the $87 region. This area represents a significant confluence of technical factors, including the value area high, VWAP-based resistance, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the prior decline. Together, these levels form a supply zone where sellers are likely to become active. Historically, when price rallies into such confluence zones without strong volume confirmation, the probability of rejection increases. This is especially true in bearish market environments, where rallies often serve as opportunities for distribution rather than accumulation. Weak volume signals fragile rally One of the most important concerns surrounding the current Solana rally is the lack of bullish volume. Despite the price moving higher, participation has remained below average, suggesting that large buyers have not meaningfully stepped in. In healthy trend reversals, a rising price is typically accompanied by expanding volume, reflecting growing demand and conviction. In this case, the lack of strong volume suggests the move higher may be driven by short-covering or opportunistic buying rather than sustained accumulation. This dynamic aligns closely with the characteristics of a dead cat bounce — a temporary recovery within a broader downtrend that ultimately fails. Bearish structure remains intact below resistance As long as Solana remains below the current resistance cluster, the broader bearish market structure remains unchanged. Failure to reclaim and hold above this zone would keep downside rotation as the higher-probability scenario. A rejection from resistance would likely send the price back toward the $70 support, setting up a potential retest of that level. Repeated tests of support often weaken demand, increasing the risk of a breakdown if buyers fail to defend the zone convincingly. As a result, how price reacts to any return to $70 will be critical in determining whether Solana can stabilize or if further downside is likely. What to expect in the coming price action From a technical, price action, and market structure perspective, Solana’s current rally appears vulnerable. The combination of low volume and heavy resistance overhead suggests that downside risk remains elevated. A rejection near current levels would favor a rotation back toward $70, keeping the bearish structure intact. For the outlook to improve meaningfully, Solana would need to break above resistance with strong volume confirmation and sustain acceptance at higher value. Until that occurs, traders should treat the current move cautiously and remain focused on price behavior as Solana navigates this critical resistance zone.75:T99e,Ethereum price continued its strong downward trend this week, reaching its lowest level since May last year. Summary Ethereum price dropped to a crucial support level as the crypto market crash accelerated. Its liquidations jumped to the highest level in months. Ethereum’s weighted funding rate dropped to its October lows. Ethereum ( ETH ) token dropped to a low of $1,768, down by 60% from its all-time high. This retreat coincided with the broader crypto market crash as retail and some institutional investors dumped the coin. Data compiled by SoSoValue shows that American investors have sold Ethereum ETFs worth $149 million this year. January is the fourth consecutive month that these funds have shed assets. Additional data show that Ethereum bulls were heavily liquidated as the crash continued. Ethereum positions worth nearly $2 billion were liquidated since January 31, the highest figure since Oct. 10 when positions worth over $3.8 billion were wiped out. Most importantly, the weighted funding rate turned negative and fell to its lowest level since Oct. 10. A negative funding rate indicates that investors anticipate the coin will decline. It happens when shorts are paying long positions in the perpetual futures market. On the positive side, Ethereum’s network is doing well, with Nansen data showing a surge in transactions, fees, and active addresses. Ethereum handled 70 million transactions in the last 30 days, while the number of active addresses rose by 42% to over 15 million. It also holds a leading market share across sectors in the crypto industry, including stablecoins, decentralized finance, and real-world asset tokenization. These fundamentals may help fuel its long-term recovery. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that ETH price has pulled back in the past few months. It has dropped from a record high of $4,950 to a low of $1,7686 today. Its lowest point was notable because it coincided with the ascending trendline connecting the lowest levels in June 2022 and April last year. The price was also important because it was near the left shoulder of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. This pattern is one of the most common bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. Therefore, a weekly close above $2,130 will point to a reversal, potentially to $3,000. On the other hand, a close below the support at $1,768 will invalidate the bullish outlook.76:T1254,XRP price remains vulnerable to further downside as unresolved single-print imbalances continue to exert technical pressure toward the $0.50 support zone. Summary Value area low has been lost , confirming bearish continuation Single-print imbalance remains unfilled , acting as a downside magnet $0.50 is critical support , where a potential macro pivot may form XRP (XRP) price action has turned decisively bearish following an impulsive move to the downside, with structural weakness continuing to dominate the chart. After losing key value levels, the market has failed to regain bullish control, despite short-lived buying reactions. From a long-term perspective, XRP appears to be trading within a broader corrective phase, with unfinished price structures remaining exposed below current levels. One of the most notable technical features influencing the current outlook is the presence of a single-print candle imbalance. This structure, which often acts as a magnet for price, suggests that XRP may need to trade lower to complete unfinished auction activity before any meaningful macro pivot can occur. XRP price key technical points Value area low has been lost , confirming bearish continuation Single-print imbalance remains partially unfilled , creating downside magnet $0.50 marks the base of the single-print structure , a critical high-timeframe level XRPUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP’s decline accelerated after the price failed to hold above the value area low, a key indication that buyers were unable to maintain acceptance at higher prices. Once this level was lost, the price fell aggressively, producing a bearish impulse that established a new swing low around $1.11. Although price has since printed a buying tail, suggesting short-term demand, this reaction has not altered the broader market structure. Lower highs and weak follow-through continue to define price behavior, indicating that any upside moves remain corrective rather than trend-changing. As long as XRP remains below reclaimed value, downside risk stays elevated. Understanding the single-print candle imbalance Single-print candles occur when price moves rapidly through a zone without sufficient two-way trade, leaving behind an area of inefficiency. From a market profile and auction theory perspective, these zones are often revisited as price seeks to rebalance and complete unfinished business. In XRP’s case, a high-timeframe single-print structure has been exposed, with only part of the imbalance filled during the recent decline. The upper portion of the single prints has already been retraced, but the base of the structure remains open. This unfinished area is located near the $0.50 level, creating a strong technical incentive for price to rotate lower. Historically, markets show a high probability of revisiting these imbalances, particularly when broader structure aligns with bearish momentum, as is currently the case with XRP. $0.50 emerges as a critical support zone The $0.50 region is not only the base of the single-print candle but also aligns with a high-timeframe support zone. This convergence increases the importance of this level and makes it a key decision point for the market. A move toward $0.50 would likely represent a continuation of the current corrective phase rather than a breakdown into uncharted territory. Such moves are often necessary to flush remaining weak hands and reset positioning before a potential macro pivot can form. However, reaching support does not automatically imply a reversal. The reaction quality at $0.50, including volume expansion, rejection wicks, and structural behavior, will ultimately determine whether XRP can form a durable bottom or continue consolidating at lower levels. What to expect in the coming price action From a technical, price-action, and market-structure perspective, XRP remains biased toward further downside until the exposed single-print imbalance is fully resolved. The $0.50 level stands out as the most likely target for this rebalancing process and a zone where the market may attempt to establish a macro pivot. If price reaches this level and shows strong acceptance and demand, it could mark the beginning of a broader base-building phase. Conversely, a weak reaction or continued acceptance below support would suggest prolonged consolidation before any sustained recovery. For now, XRP remains structurally weak despite a short-term balance, with incomplete auction dynamics favoring a continuation of the lower trend. Traders should closely monitor how price behaves as it approaches the $0.50 region, as this area is likely to define the next major phase of XRP’s market cycle.77:Ta30,In brief South Korean exchange Bithumb mistakenly credited users with 2,000 BTC each instead of a tiny cash reward. The error was corrected within five minutes, but not before users sold an estimated $2 billion worth, per local reports. The sell-off, only on Bithumb's internal ledger and not on-chain, still triggered a sharp Bitcoin price crash on the exchange. A South Korean crypto exchange accidentally credited users with billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin this week, triggering a flash crash in the platform’s listed value of the token. Instead of airdropping users 2,000 won (a sum worth $1.37 at writing), the exchange, Bithumb, reportedly sent 2,000 BTC apiece, users said . That massive sum was worth some $142 million at writing, with Bitcoin recently trading around $71,000. According to local reports , the accidental transfers were made as part of a “Random Box” giveaway, where 96% of recipients were poised to receive the lowest-value prize (presumably, the 2,000 won). Around 700 Bithumb users bought Random Boxes, meaning roughly 672 likely received the erroneous Bitcoin. That would put the current value of Bitcoin accidentally transferred to Bithumb customers at over $95.4 billion. The deposits were recorded only on Bithumb’s internal ledgers, though, and didn’t involve actual on-chain transfers of Bitcoin. The irregularity was detected and corrected within five minutes, the company said today in a blog post . But that was plenty enough time for some amazed Bithumb users to attempt to sell off the funds and make millions off the company’s error. Korean financial authorities estimate that users managed to sell off over $2 billion worth of the phantom Bitcoin in that window, per local reports. Such a rapid sell-off immediately plunged Bitcoin's price on the exchange to $55,000—far below prices on other exchanges, despite the cryptocurrency’s recent downturn . The price of Bitcoin bottomed out around $60,000 on most exchanges Thursday before rebounding to a recent price of $71,047. “The Bitcoin price temporarily fluctuated sharply as some accounts that received the Bitcoin sold it,” Bithumb said. “We want to make it clear that this incident is unrelated to any external hacking or security breach, and does not pose any issues with system security or customer asset management,” the company added. Bithumb further insisted that the chain of events did not result in any customer’s loss of preexisting assets.

What a ride it has been in the cryptocurrency space lately. The quick and sharp moves continue as of press time, as BTC has skyrocketed to over $71,000 just less than a day after it dipped to $60,000. The altcoins are well in the green now on a daily scale, and the total crypto market cap has increased by roughly $200 billion since its low from earlier this morning. BTCUSD Feb 6. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s price chart from above paints a very clear and volatile picture. It shows that the cryptocurrency plummeted by roughly $30,000 in the span of just over a week – from last Wednesday to Friday morning. As reported earlier today, popular analysts blamed this latest crash, in which bitcoin dropped from $77,000 to $60,000 in about 24 hours, to emotional selling and structural change rather than broken fundamentals within BTC and the crypto market. Since then, BTC has gone on a tear. It added over $10,000 since this morning’s multi-year low, and briefly surpassed $71,000 minutes ago before it was stopped and now trades inches below it. The altcoins have produced even more impressive gains, with XRP leading the pack. Ripple’s cross-border token has soared by 19% daily to over $1.50 as of press time, while ETH has reclaimed the psychological $2,000 level. The total value of wrecked positions daily is still over $2 billion, but most of it is from longs, which happened before today’s recovery. Nevertheless, over $350 million worth of shorts have been wrecked in the past 12 hours, with BTC responsible for the lion’s share ($261 million).

The move highlights the fragile and highly reactive state of the broader crypto market. During the 5 February session , XRP fell by 19.64% to trade at $1.21 , sliding alongside a wider market drawdown that also pushed Bitcoin sharply lower. The decline was fast and disorderly, with elevated volume pointing to forced selling rather than a controlled pullback. By the end of the session, XRP had retraced to levels not seen in weeks, placing the token firmly in short-term capitulation territory. However, sentiment shifted quickly in the following session. A fast rebound, not a quiet recovery On 6 February, XRP surged by more than 24% intraday , rebounding to trade around $1.50 after briefly dipping to the l ow-$1.20s during the sell-off. The speed of the recovery stands out, particularly given that Bitcoin’s rebound, while notable, was comparatively restrained. Source: TradingView Trading volume remained elevated during the bounce, with 449 million recorded as of this writing. This suggests active repositioning by traders rather than a low-liquidity drift higher. This kind of price action typically reflects a combination of short-covering and dip-buying, especially after sharp downside moves flush out overleveraged positions. Volatility still driving XRP price action Despite the rebound, the structure of XRP’s recent move points to continued volatility rather than a clean trend reversal. Momentum indicators show that while downside pressure eased, price action remains reactive and sensitive to broader market moves. Notably, sentiment readings have stayed relatively high even after the sell-off, indicating that market confidence has not fully reset. As of this writing, the sentiment was around 78% . Historically, this mismatch — sharp price declines without a deeper sentiment reset — often coincides with choppy trading conditions rather than sustained directional moves. Bitcoin stabilizes, but XRP remains the swing trade Bitcoin also recovered during the same session, climbing back above recent lows to trade at $70,000 , after briefly dipping below key psychological levels. However, XRP’s sharper rebound underscores its higher beta profile during periods of market stress. While this relative strength may attract short-term traders, it also reinforces the idea that XRP remains particularly sensitive to shifts in risk appetite. Until volatility subsides and price structure stabilizes, outsized moves in both directions are likely to persist. Final Thoughts XRP’s rebound reflects a volatility-driven snapback after a near-20% sell-off, not a confirmed trend reversal. With sentiment still elevated, price action may remain unstable as traders react to broader market signals.7a:T436,Goldman is working with embedded Anthropic engineers to develop Claude-powered agents across accounting, KYC, and internal operations. Goldman Sachs is working with Anthropic to develop AI agents that automate tasks like trade accounting and client onboarding, according to a CNBC report . The project, underway for six months, uses Anthropic’s Claude model and involves embedded engineers co-developing tools to speed up complex workflows. The agents, expected to launch soon, are part of a broader generative AI strategy announced by CEO David Solomon, who said the bank would limit headcount growth during the shift. Goldman started with Devin, an AI coding assistant, but quickly expanded to other areas. Claude proved effective in compliance and accounting functions that involve parsing documents and applying rules, surprising executives with its versatility. Future agents may assist in pitch book creation or employee surveillance, Goldman CIO Marco Argenti told CNBC. While no job cuts are expected yet, he said AI could eventually replace some third-party services.7b:Tfaf,Ripple integrates Hyperliquid Ripple Prime International CEO shares excitement about latest integration with potential upside for XRP. Derivatives access . Ripple has enabled Hyperliquid support on its institutional prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime. Ripple Prime International CEO Mike Higgins shares his excitement about the latest integration of Hyperliquid, a leading decentralized derivatives venue. Yesterday, Ripple announced that Ripple Prime, its institutional prime brokerage platform, has enabled support for Hyperliquid. According to Mike Higgins, the next phase of institutions joining the on-chain economy starts with capital markets' integration and the integration of HyperliquidX, a liquid venue for crypto price discovery and on-chain derivatives remains an obvious place to start. HOT Stories XRP cross margin . Ripple Prime clients can now cross-margin crypto across asset classes, including XRP. The move enables institutions to access on-chain derivatives liquidity through HyperliquidX; Ripple Prime customers can also cross-margin crypto with all asset classes supported by the prime brokerage platform, which includes XRP. Higgins signals benefits for XRP amid the latest Hyperliquid integration, saying, "From XRP and other crypto assets to heavy metals perps. I’m incredibly excited for Ripple Prime clients to be able to tap into this liquidity through a single, secure counterparty." Peter Brandt flags 'campaign selling' of Bitcoin Legendary trader Brandt spots a cold, surgical sell-off unfolding. Manufactured crash . Peter Brandt says Bitcoin’s eight-day downtrend shows signs of deliberate campaign selling, not random liquidation. According to veteran chartist Peter Brandt, the current eight-day downtrend on Bitcoin (BTC) shows all the hallmarks of a calculated campaign sell-off, not a random liquidation. His analysis points to two critical levels now in play: the already-breached $70,000 and a far more ominous target at $63,800, based on a measured move from the recent wedge breakdown. With over $850 million wiped out in liquidations and fear metrics collapsing, this is not a normal dip. Campaign selling. Brandt highlights a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows, describing it as institutional-sized flows systematically reducing exposure. If Brandt’s structure plays out, the market may be staring down a deeper flush that few retail holders are ready for. In his latest public Bitcoin outlook, Brandt pointed to the ongoing eight-day streak of lower highs and lower lows in BTC’s price, characterizing the formation as a textbook example of "campaign selling" — in which institutional-sized flows systematically get rid of excessive exposure to the cryptocurrency. Vitalik-Linked on-chain activity adds pressure to Ethereum sell-off Ethereum co-founder Buterin is actively selling his Ethereum holdings. ETH sell-off . On-chain data shows wallets linked Buterin traded roughly 2,961.5 ETH (about $6.6 million) over the past three days. High-profile on-chain activity connected to Ethereum Cofounder Vitalik Buterin seems to be the most recent catalyst for the severe selling pressure that Ethereum is currently experiencing. Blockchain tracking data indicates that over the past three days wallets linked to Buterin have bought and sold about 2,961.5 ETH, or roughly $6.6 million, at an average execution price of about $2,228. Volume spike. The breakdown triggered one of the largest sell-offs since mid-2025, sending ETH rapidly into the $2,100–$2,200 range. The timing of this activity is critical for Ethereum's price structure. ETH has already lost important support zones on the daily chart, which were once strong consolidation areas around $2,800 and $2,700. One of the biggest sell-offs since mid-2025 occurred as a result of the most recent breakdown, which drove the price quickly toward the $2,100-2,200 range. Sellers, not passive holders, are driving the current price action, as evidenced by the volume spike during the decline.7c:T13da,Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Remittix gains attention with live utility and 300% bonus, attracting selective investors amid market turbulence. Summary Remittix leads the crypto rotation with live PayFi utility, a 300% bonus, and $28.9m raised in private funding. Built on Ethereum, Remittix targets $19 trillion cross-border payments, enabling real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers globally. Investor confidence rises as Remittix completes CertiK audit, ranks top on Skynet, and secures BitMart and LBank listings. This week in Crypto has been characterized by heavy selling on centralized exchanges as Bitcoin dropped to new lows in 2026 following the violation of key support levels. Risk appetite has calmed down a lot, and fund managers of top institutions are also rebalancing their portfolios as macroeconomic challenges continue to hit many digital assets. The majority of altcoins have followed the same free-fall Bitcoin has shown, and with correction taking place, capital flows now paint a more stratified image. An increasing number of investors are choosing to place selective investments in projects that show real progress, solid schedules, and strong asymmetric potential. One name now dominating that rotation is Remittix , a PayFi-focused Ethereum protocol that is rapidly gaining attention thanks to a rare combination of live utility and a time-limited 300% bonus window that analysts say materially changes the short-term risk-reward profile. Remittix’s PayFi model is built for real adoption, not market cycles Remittix is positioning itself squarely at the intersection of crypto and real-world finance. Built on Ethereum, the protocol is here to bridge the inefficiencies that businesses and individuals encounter when trying to send money internationally. The top Defi project is on course to become one of the biggest players in the $19 trillion global cross-border payments market, enabling direct crypto-to-fiat transfers with real-time settlement to bank accounts in 30+ countries, providing real-time utility to businesses, merchants, and individual clients. This execution-only strategy is among the reasons why investor interest has been so strong despite the broader markets retreating. Strong backing has also helped boost confidence. According to recent reports, Remittix has already raised over $28.9 million in private capital, which reflects continued involvement of institutional and high-net-worth investors. On the exchange front, listings on BitMart and LBank are already confirmed, with additional centralized exchange discussions reportedly ongoing. From a security standpoint, the project has completed a full CertiK audit and currently holds a leading pre-launch ranking on CertiK Skynet , adding an independent layer of credibility at a time when trust matters. Remittix latest bonus incentive fuels aggressive capital influx While infrastructure and adoption underpin the long-term thesis, near-term momentum around Remittix is being driven by its active deposit incentive tied to the native RTX token. According to official project updates, participants can receive up to a 300% bonus on qualifying deposits, one of the most aggressive incentive structures currently available in the market. This dynamic is why some analysts suggest scenarios where relatively modest capital allocations can be meaningfully amplified during the campaign window. With the bonus applied, a $5,000 deposit can translate into substantially higher effective token exposure, creating a setup that many market commentators have described as unusually favorable under current conditions. Additional factors reinforcing momentum include: Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank Live crypto-to-fiat settlement across 30+ countries A growing and active global holder community A functional Remittix wallet is already live A clear roadmap centered on measurable PayFi adoption February 9, 2026 PayFi launch anchors the long-term thesis Beyond the bonus-driven surge, Remittix has confirmed that its full PayFi platform will officially go live on February 9 , 2026. That milestone provides a concrete timeline, something increasingly valued as markets mature and speculative narratives lose favor. As volatility reshapes capital allocation strategies, investors are becoming more selective. Projects with audited security, working products, exchange access, and real-world relevance are increasingly separated from the noise. With its PayFi infrastructure already live and a limited-time bonus amplifying early exposure, Remittix is being framed less as a short-term trade and more as a calculated positioning play ahead of broader adoption.

While broader crypto markets weaken, on-chain accumulation and ETF flows suggest a widening disconnect between price action and underlying demand. Chainlink Reserve Growth Signals Long-Term Commitment The Chainlink Reserve continues to expand its footprint as a long-term sustainability mechanism for the network. According to official data, the reserve has accumulated 125,454.48 LINK, bringing total holdings to approximately 1.9 million LINK. This reserve is funded through a combination of off-chain enterprise revenue and on-chain service usage, reinforcing its role as infrastructure rather than a market-facing liquidity tool. RESERVE UPDATE Today, the Chainlink Reserve has accumulated 125,454.48 LINK. The Chainlink Reserve now holds a total of 1,899,670.39 LINK. https://t.co/oxMv5N3rFC The Chainlink Reserve is designed to support the long-term growth and sustainability of the Chainlink Network by… pic.twitter.com/uaLv42504k — Chainlink (@chainlink) February 5, 2026 Meanwhile, this steady accumulation occurs independently of short-term LINK price USD fluctuations. That separation is notable. Historically, reserves of this nature tend to grow during periods of suppressed market confidence, when usage-driven revenues quietly outpace speculative demand. At the same time, the reserve’s design reduces reliance on inflationary incentives, aligning with Chainlink’s broader goal of long-term network sustainability rather than cyclical price appreciation. ETF Inflows Contrast Broader Crypto Outflows From a flows perspective, Chainlink stands out. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have experienced consistent outflows during recent market stress, LINK ETF products have yet to record a single day of net outflows. Data shows cumulative inflows of $78.63 million, representing roughly 1.11% of LINK’s market capitalization. Notably, institutional vehicles such as Grayscale and Bitwise have maintained their exposure even as volatility increased. That persistence suggests portfolio-level conviction rather than momentum-driven positioning. Still, ETF stability alone has not insulated the LINK price chart from downside pressure. Whale Distribution Adds Near-Term Pressure That said, on-chain supply distribution reveals a more complex picture. Addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million LINK have been net sellers over the past 48 hours. This cohort historically acts as a liquidity driver during periods of market stress, and their activity aligns with recent downside moves. Conversely, wallets holding 100,000 to 1 million LINK continue to accumulate. This divergence suggests a transfer of supply from larger entities to mid-sized holders rather than broad capitulation. Still, until selling from the upper bracket cools, downward pressure on LINK crypto markets may persist. Technical Zones and Risk Framing From a technical perspective, analysts continue to closely monitor lower channel supports. If demand weakens further, $5 appears as a historically relevant zone where price compression previously stabilized. A deeper downside scenario places attention on the $1.20 region, which aligns with long-term cycle extremes rather than base expectations. Still, the LINK price analysis suggests that these levels on chart function more as stress-test markers than forecasts. With the LINK price already down materially from cycle highs, further declines would likely require sustained macro deterioration and continued whale distribution.

Feb 6, 2026, 5:29 p.m. Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, is moving toward offering loans secured by cryptocurrency and said Friday it is prepared to coordinate with the country’s central bank on shaping the necessary regulatory framework, according to Reuters. The lender has already tested the model in January. The bank issued the country's first bitcoin-backed loan to one of its largest bitcoin miners, IntelionData, calling the transaction a pilot and suggesting it was keen to issue more in the future. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The volume of digital financial asset issuances on the platform hit 408 billion rubles (about $5.3 billion) in 2025 — an increase of 5.6 times versus 2024 (73 billion rubles, or $948 million) and 204 times greater than 2023 (2 billion rubles or $26 million). Sberbank’s regulated digital financial asset (DFA) business expanded rapidly in 2025, with total issuance reaching RUB 408 billion ($4.9 billion), more than 5.6 times the 2024 level, while the bank’s own DFA holdings grew sevenfold in six months to RUB 185 billion ($2.2 billion). The growth comes alongside a still-dominant traditional balance sheet: in December, Sber’s corporate loan portfolio stood at RUB 30.4 trillion ($365 billion), its retail loan book at RUB 18.8 trillion ($226 billion), and client deposits at RUB 33.1 trillion ($398 billion), highlighting the relatively small but fast-scaling role of tokenized assets within Russia’s largest lender. When announcing the trial loan, Anatoly Popov, Sberbank's deputy chairman, said the bank already offers clients structured bonds and digital financial assets with investments in bitcoin and ether. Popov also said the bank was currently testing decentralized finance (DeFi) instruments and supports the gradual legalization of cryptocurrencies within the Russian legal framework. Another major lender, Sovcombank, became the first Russian bank to roll out crypto-backed lending on Feb. 5 to individuals and businesses legally holding bitcoin. In December 2025, it reopened the cryptocurrency market to the public with new rules laid out by the country’s central bank. Officials expect to complete legislation governing crypto assets by July 1, 2026. Sberbank said the planned lending program would target not only mining companies but also businesses that hold cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.7f:Ta86,XRP price rockets 18%, staging wildest recovery among major tokens The move came as bitcoin briefly rose over $70,000 in U.S. morning hours, reversing Thursday's sharp declines ahead of the weekend. Feb 6, 2026, 5:24 p.m. XRP staged a sharp rebound on Friday, rising about 18% over 24 hours to trade near $1.49 after a deep selloff a day earlier made it the worst performer among major tokens. The move came as bitcoin briefly rose over $70,000 in U.S. morning hours, reversing Thursday's sharp declines ahead of the weekend. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The bounce came after XRP collapsed to roughly $1.14 in the prior session, a move that triggered heavy liquidations and flushed out traders who had been leaning too hard on leverage. Data shows short liquidations of roughly $26 million in the past 24 hours, compared with around $30 million in longs from earlier Thursday. That imbalance matters. It suggests the market wasn’t reacting to fresh bad news as much as it was mechanically clearing out bullish bets as prices slid. Once those positions were forced shut, selling pressure eased and XRP was able to rebound quickly. The recovery also comes at an awkward time for XRP’s broader narrative. Ripple and its ecosystem have spent the past week pitching a more institutional future for the XRP Ledger, including plans for permissioned markets, lending and privacy tools. Flare, a closely watched project trying to bring DeFi-style utility to XRP through FXRP, also expanded institutional access through custody firm Hex Trust. But none of that helped XRP sentiment when the market cracked. Friday’s rally, then, looks less like investors suddenly buying into the “institutional DeFi” pitch and more like a classic crypto snapback: a steep fall, a leverage wipeout, then a fast rebound once forced sellers are gone. Meanwhile, a ratio of bullish versus bearish bets on futures tracking XRP shows retail longs got rinsed, but big traders were leaning the other way. On Binance, the overall account-based long/short ratio is 2.13 as of Friday, meaning there were about 2x more accounts positioned long than short. That’s usually a sign of crowded bullish positioning — lots of smaller traders expecting a bounce. But at the same time, Binance’s top trader long/short (positions) is ~0.73, which means the biggest traders on Binance were net short. That split suggests XRP’s dump wasn’t random: it likely ran into a market where smaller traders were stubbornly long, while larger players were positioned to profit from a flush. And once those longs were cleared, XRP did what it usually does after a wipeout: it snapped back violently, because there wasn’t much selling left.80:T1777,Ripple (XRP) delivered one of the market’s top rallies in 2021, peaking at $1.96. However, as the market matures, analysts note that replicating big gains has become difficult for large-cap tokens. This shift has investors searching for the best crypto to invest in 2026. One DeFi crypto now drawing significant attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a low-priced token at $0.04 in presale. MUTM is gaining traction for its decentralized lending and borrowing model and rapidly advancing presale adoption. Analysts believe MUTM has the potential to outperform even XRP’s 2021 run in the next market rally. This makes it the best crypto to invest in for early adopters. Ripple (XRP) Holds Key Support During Market Reset Ripple (XRP) is priced at $1.521, down roughly 56% from its 2025 high. This decline has occurred alongside continued ecosystem progress, including Ripple Labs securing an EU-wide electronic money license, which supports longer-term integration with financial institutions across Europe. For now, price action suggests a stabilization phase as the market digests recent volatility, with XRP behaving more as a mature, infrastructure-focused asset than a high-growth play. Investors are now keeping an eye on newer tokens that are still early in their development cycles, among them MUTM. Ripple (XRP) 2021 Rally: A Benchmark for Future Gains In 2021, Ripple (XRP) delivered one of the market’s standout performances, rising from around $0.21 at the start of the year to a cycle high of $1.96, representing roughly a 900% gain over the course of the year. This surge was driven by renewed investor interest, network developments, and broader crypto market momentum. Analysts suggest that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the potential to replicate or even surpass similar percentage gains in the next cycle. These market strategists point to MUTM’s strong value drivers, such as its dual lending model, staking dividends, and attractive lending APYs, and rapidly progressing presale. This further positions MUTM as the best crypto to invest in for strategic market entrants. MUTM Presale: Early Investors Gain the Edge Mutuum Finance’s MUTM token is currently at $0.04 in Phase 7 of its presale, and is set to increase to $0.045 in Phase 8. Early participants are positioned to benefit the most from this price progression. Take the example of an investor putting $2,500 into the presale today. They will acquire 62,500 MUTM tokens. When Phase 8 begins, these tokens will be worth nearly $3,000, delivering a profit of $500 even before the presale concludes. By the time of listing at $0.06, the same holding will be valued at $3,750, representing a gain of $1,250 prior to any public market activity. This demonstrates why early entry into the MUTM presale can yield substantial returns for investors. Passive Income Through Token Buybacks Mutuum Finance incentivizes loyalty through its buyback and redistribution mechanism, which channels a portion of protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens and distribute them to mtToken stakers. For example, if the protocol generates $9 million in quarterly revenue and allocates 15% of it, or $1.35 million, for buybacks, this amount would be used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and return them to active stakers. An investor with a stake representing 0.5% of all staked mtTokens would receive approximately $6,750 worth of additional MUTM as passive income, on top of any interest accrued from lending pools. This provides a dual benefit of ongoing yield and rewards for long-term participation. The MUTM Stablecoin In the future, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce its own overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to let users unlock liquidity without giving up yield on their assets. Mutuum Finance’s native stablecoin allows users to borrow liquidity while their collateral continues to yield interest in lending pools. Collateral is required, e.g 150% of the borrowed amount to maintain system safety. For instance, an investor holding $30,000 in ETH could deposit the full amount as collateral to mint $18,000 in MUTM stablecoin. The ETH continues to accrue interest in Mutuum Finance’s lending pools, e.g 7–10% APY, where part of the yield generated can be used to repay the stablecoin loan. Community Engagement Drives Adoption Mutuum Finance has also focused on creating a strong and active community. The project recently launched a $100,000 giveaway , awarding $10,000 in MUTM tokens to ten lucky participants. Daily incentives, such as a $500 MUTM reward for the largest buyer of the day, encourage continuous engagement, while the recognition of the top 50 MUTM holders on a leaderboard fosters friendly competition among the community. These initiatives cultivate a loyal and active user base, driving adoption of the platform and positioning MUTM as one of the most promising new DeFi crypto projects entering 2026. Forget XRP’s old rally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could easily be the best crypto to invest in for 2026. Priced at $0.04, this DeFi crypto offers a real lending platform and has raised over $20M, positioning it for huge gains. Join the presale today, while MUTM is still undervalued.

While XRP has matured and currently trades around $1.52 amid regulatory progress, analysts suggest that large-cap tokens may struggle to replicate previous explosive gains. Consequently, investors are turning their attention to early-stage opportunities like MUTM, a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol currently in its presale phase at $0.04.

Mutuum Finance is positioning itself for significant growth through features such as a dual lending model, staking dividends, and a buyback mechanism that rewards token holders. The presale structure offers immediate profit potential for early investors before the token lists at $0.06, with projections suggesting it could rival XRP’s 2021 surge. Additionally, the project plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin and is actively building its community through giveaways and incentives to drive adoption.82:Tae0,The latest announcement from the People's Bank of China follows months of flip-flopping on privately issued yuan-pegged stablecoins. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, and seven Chinese regulatory agencies published a joint statement on Friday banning the unapproved issuance of Renminbi-pegged stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). The ban applies to both domestic and foreign stablecoin and tokenized RWA issuers, according to the statement , which was also signed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and China’s Securities Regulatory Commission. A translation of the announcement said: “Stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies perform some of the functions of fiat currencies in disguise during circulation and use. No unit or individual at home or abroad may issue RMB-linked stablecoins without the consent of relevant departments.” Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at New York University (NYU) Law School and former Managing Director of CIC, China's sovereign wealth fund, told Cointelegraph that the ban extends to the onshore and offshore versions of China’s Renminbi, also called the yuan. “The Beijing crypto ban rule applies across all RMB-related markets, whether CNH or CNY,” he said. CNH is the offshore version of the Renminbi, designed to give the currency flexibility in foreign exchange markets, without sacrificing currency controls, Ma said. “This is the latest step in a multi‑year project: Keep speculative crypto outside the formal financial system, while actively promoting the usage of e-CNY, the sovereign CBDC issued by China's central bank,” he said. The structure of the digital yuan, China’s CBDC. Sources: Cointelegraph Chinese government briefly considered yuan-pegged stables, but focused on CBDC instead In August 2025, reports began circulating that China’s government was considering allowing private companies to issue yuan-pegged stablecoins , a major reversal of long-standing policy. However, the Chinese government restricted stablecoin and digital asset issuance in September of that same year, instructing stablecoin issuers to pause or halt their stablecoin trials until further notice. In January 2026, the PBOC approved commercial banks paying interest to digital yuan wallets in a push to make the CBDC more attractive to investors.

The headline numbers are eye-watering. Alphabet, Google’s parent, alone plans to spend as much as $185 billion this year. However, the capital surge will involve more than buying chips and servers, as Microsoft and Meta are also increasing AI budgets. This means that the real race is now being fought over physical infrastructure, including pipelines, grid interconnections, and the scramble to secure large blocks of power capacity. Thus, the projected spending will reshape power markets and put a premium on the one asset distressed Bitcoin miners still control: “ready-to-run” energy infrastructure. For Bitcoin miners seeking to reinvent themselves as data center landlords , this spending surge presents a massive growth opportunity precisely when their core business is under siege. A mining industry under severe financial stress The timing of these firms' planned spending surge matters because miners are operating under some of the weakest economic conditions in Bitcoin’s history. Data from CryptoQuant indicate that the recent market correction has pushed miners into what the firm describes as a phase of “miner capitulation,” a period marked by acute financial stress that has historically coincided with local market bottoms. The pressure is visible across multiple indicators. CryptoQuant’s Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability metric has fallen to -30, indicating that miners’ daily revenue in US dollar terms is approximately 30% lower than it was 30 days earlier. Bitcoin Miner Profit and Loss Sustainability (Source: CryptoQuant) The indicator has entered the “extremely underpaid” zone, a level that indicates widespread unprofitability among operators. At the same time, the Puell Multiple, another measure of miner revenue relative to historical norms, has dropped to 0.69, reinforcing the view that mining economics have deteriorated sharply. At these levels, inefficient miners are typically forced to shut down machines, sell assets, or liquidate Bitcoin holdings to survive. Notably, some of these miners have already been offloading their BTC holdings in the current bear market. CryptoQuant’s Miner Position Index (MPI) and Exchange-Miner Mean Inflow metrics have both spiked in recent weeks, signaling that large mining entities are moving Bitcoin to exchanges at an accelerated pace. In January alone, miners transferred approximately 175,000 Bitcoin to Binance, an unusually high figure relative to stable periods. According to CryptoQuant data , the activity was punctuated by sharp bursts of outflows, with single-day transfers reaching nearly 10,000 Bitcoin. Bitcoin Miners Transfers to Exchanges in January (Source: CryptoQuant) Such spikes point to deliberate liquidity decisions rather than routine treasury management. While transferring Bitcoin to exchanges does not guarantee immediate selling, it increases available supply on order books. In a weak-demand environment, that supply can translate into short-term price pressure, reinforcing the feedback loop and squeezing miners’ margins. Historically, periods when miners are “extremely underpaid” and selling pressure peaks have preceded cyclical bottoms. But the clearing process can be brutal, and not every operator survives it. Why these AI spending changes the equation This is the backdrop against which a big tech firm's $500 billion capital expenditure plan becomes relevant for miners. The AI boom has created a bottleneck that GPUs alone cannot solve. Compute deployment is increasingly constrained by access to electricity, cooling capacity, grid interconnections, and permitting. Those constraints align closely with the assets miners already control. Over the past decade, large miners have assembled power-heavy campuses designed to run dense compute loads around the clock. They have negotiated long-term power agreements, built transmission links, and learned to operate energy-intensive infrastructure at scale. While Bitcoin mining hardware is not interchangeable with AI servers, the underlying sites are scarce and increasingly valuable. Big tech firm's decision to press ahead with AI investment signals that demand for compute remains strong enough to justify building through those constraints rather than waiting for them to ease. That demand directly supports the economics of converting or co-developing mining sites into high-performance computing facilities at a time when Bitcoin-derived revenue is collapsing.

You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. For context, Alphabet-owned Google has provided at least $5 billion of disclosed credit support behind a handful of BTC miners' AI projects. Those backstops lower counterparty risk and make projects financeable on terms that would be difficult for miners to secure on their own, especially during a downturn. These structures matter because they transform a miner’s profile. Instead of relying entirely on volatile Bitcoin rewards, operators gain long-duration, contracted cash flows that can be financed like infrastructure. For an industry currently forced to sell Bitcoin to stay afloat, that stability is powerful and could provide a durable lifeline. What the $500 billion really represents In practical terms, the big tech firm's planned $500 billion in AI capex is positive for Bitcoin miners for three reasons. First, it reinforces demand for AI data center capacity at a time when mining revenue metrics show miners are extremely underpaid and under pressure to capitulate. Second, it elevates the value of miners’ core asset, power-ready campuses, precisely when on-chain data shows miners are being forced to sell Bitcoin to cover costs . Third, through backstops and structured financing, firms like Google are effectively underwriting the transition, turning distressed crypto operators into viable infrastructure partners. That combination explains why, in the middle of one of the harshest periods for mining profitability on record, the big tech firm's AI spending boom is being viewed by miners not as competition for power, but as a potential lifeline. A paradox for Bitcoin’s security model There is, however, an uncomfortable flip side to this lifeline. The current miner capitulation is coinciding with a structural shift in how infrastructure is utilized. When miners temporarily shut down due to price declines, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment can eventually restore balance. But when sites are permanently repurposed for AI under 15-year leases, that power capacity is removed from the network’s security budget indefinitely. Market observers note that the conversion of mining infrastructure to AI could have long-term implications for Bitcoin’s hashrate, even if the absolute security level remains high today. A sustained reduction in marginal mining capacity increases centralization risks and lowers the cost of attacking the network at the margin. From a market perspective, the tension reflects the stakes: Big Tech’s spending can help mining companies survive and stabilize their balance sheets, but it accelerates a reallocation of resources away from Bitcoin toward higher-paying AI workloads.

Bitcoin reclaimed the $70,000 level today after surging more than 11% by midday Friday, recovering from its steepest single-day drop since the FTX collapse. The leading crypto asset had plunged below $60,000 on Thursday before rebounding sharply. Ethereum climbed back above $2,000 after falling to $1,750, while Solana recovered to $86 from a low of $65. XRP rallied 22% to $1.50 after dipping below $1.14, with the broader crypto market retracing most of its losses from the previous session. Crypto-exposed equities also snapped back. Strategy shares surged over 21% to $130 after nearing a breakdown below $100 in Thursday’s after-hours trading, following the firm’s $12.4 billion quarterly loss announcement. Coinbase gained 10%, Galaxy rose 17%, and mining stocks Marathon and Cipher jumped 20% and 13%, respectively. Traditional markets staged a recovery from levels not seen since mid-December. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were both up around 1.5% by midday. In commodities, gold climbed nearly 4% toward the $5,000 mark, while silver surged 8% to $76. Both remain well below last week’s record highs. Despite the broad bounce, some analysts warned this could be a short-lived relief rally, citing persistent macroeconomic headwinds and advising caution ahead of next week’s open.85:T1239,Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Summary Remittix sparks crypto buzz with an exclusive 300% bonus, backed by 703m+ tokens sold and $28.9m raised. Analysts highlight Remittix’s working wallet, strong funding, and growth plan as drivers of this week’s crypto talk. Crypto communities react to Remittix’s rare bonus, emphasizing urgency, scarcity, and verified project progress. This week, crypto users on X, Telegram, and Discord are talking about one thing: the Remittix 300% bonus . While the market as a whole is still slow, this brings in new excitement. Experts have said that this incident is important because it is not just about promises or hype around cryptocurrency; this time, it is about an actual product. In past cycles, big bonuses were often linked to risky or unfinished projects. Remittix is different because it already has a working wallet, strong funding, and a clear growth plan. That is why many analysts are calling this one of the most talked-about crypto events of the week. Why this Remittix bonus is getting so much attention The main reason for the buzz is that a 300% bonus is extremely rare in today’s cryptocurrency market. Even more surprisingly, this bonus is not open to everyone. It is exclusive and requires a special code that can only be gotten through email. The code is not public, and you cannot find it in any online articles. This setup has piqued the curiosity of many users. It evokes a sense of urgency and scarcity for the bonus offer. Experts have noted that this is why the topic is trending in crypto communities at the moment. Analysts have all agreed that the true reason for the interest in the topic is what Remittix is working on behind the scenes. Another reason this event is getting attention is Remittix’s strong fundraising performance. The project has sold over 703.7 million tokens, raised more than $28.9 million, and is currently trading at $0.123 per token. Experts say this level of progress shows that many investors are backing the idea even before the full platform launch. Remittix: A project focused on real use Remittix is a PayFi project, and this means it focuses on payments, not just trading or speculation. Its goal is to help people use crypto in real life by making it easy to move money across borders. Many crypto users face the same problem. They hold digital assets, but turning them into cash that they can actually spend is slow and costly. Banks charge high fees, and transfers can take days. Remittix is designed to fix this. For instance, with Remittix, you can send cryptocurrency, and the recipient receives the funds in local currency and is directly deposited into their bank account. This is especially useful for freelancers, remote workers, and those in countries with poor banking systems. What sets Remittix apart is that it has already made progress. Remittix: Real progress that builds trust Unlike many crypto projects, Remittix already has a functional product. The wallet is already available on the Apple App Store , so users can use it anytime they want. The Google Play Store version will be available very soon. Another major milestone is the full PayFi platform launch scheduled for February 9, 2026 . Experts believe this date is important because it marks the move from early testing into full-scale use. Here are some of the key features driving interest in Remittix: Remittix is fully verified by the CertiK team KYC The project ranks #1 on pre-launch tokens The platform offers lower fees than traditional remittance services It is built for everyday users and not just crypto traders Conclusion: More than just a bonus event While the headlines focus on the Remittix 300% bonus , experts say the bigger picture is more important. Remittix already has a live wallet, a clear mission to fix real payment problems, and a confirmed PayFi platform launch on February 9, 2026. This week’s buzz is not just about free value. It is about a project that combines strong incentives with real-world utility. That combination is rare, and it explains why Remittix has become the crypto event everyone is talking about right now.

Bitcoin's perceived role as "digital gold" has come into question as the precious metal has soared while BTC has crashed. A panel at Digital Assets Forum London argued that the significance of Bitcoin's four-year "halvings" has diminished. Gold and Bitcoin work most effectively when they're in the same portfolio, a Bitwise executive has argued. Speaking at the Digital Assets Forum in London, Bradley Duke, Managing Director and Head of Europe at the digital asset management firm said that gold "is a better cushion" when markets are falling, while BTC offers greater upside during rebounds. "One is more to the upside risk and the other is more protecting against the downside of uncertainty," Duke said. The Bitwise exec was speaking during a panel examining whether crypto's four-year cycles are dead. Ominously, the discussion was held on Thursday, when Bitcoin fell almost as low as $60,000 during a punishing drawdown . The analogy of Bitcoin as "digital gold" has taken a hammering of late, with both assets on divergent paths. While the precious metal has surged by 46% over the past six months, setting a new all-time high in the process, the world's biggest cryptocurrency is down 40% over the same period. When asked about why gold had proven more popular than Bitcoin of late, Duke pointed to "muscle memory," with investors flocking to a safe haven asset that has existed for thousands of years. "Allocators and countries have bought gold in this way for hundreds of years and will continue to do that until there is the trust established in this new better money, which is Bitcoin," he added. "But that takes time." On prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt 's parent company Dastan, users put a 67% chance Bitcoin costing 10 oz of gold rather than 30 oz after its next move. Bitcoin’s “four-year cycle” Until recently, many analysts believed that BTC operated in four-year cycles of boom and bust, driven by "halvings" where the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market permanently falls by 50%. This last happened back in 2024, with the next expected to take place in April 2028. But according to those on the panel, the significance of halvings has diminished—primarily because most of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist is already in circulation—with volumes from exchange-traded funds also blunting this digital asset's volatility. Anatoly Crachilov, CEO of Nickel Digital, said the supply of new BTC has been "completely dwarfed by ETF flows, by basis trades and by treasury acquisitions." Duke argued that Bitcoin was "growing up,” and “bootstrapping itself to become a macro asset for the long term.” Where initially, the only Bitcoin investors were "cypherpunks and what we call OGs now,” he added, “today we see sovereign states investing in Bitcoin." The managing partner of Fifth Era Blockchain Coinvestors, Matthew Le Merle, admitted that Bitcoin's recent contraction was "very challenging," especially for investors who bought at the top. However, he argued that a more pressing matter is turning Bitcoin into "a global peer-to-peer cash" at a time when only a few thousand top-tier blockchain developers exist worldwide, and many risk being drawn to alternative industries such as artificial intelligence. "If you're investing because you think you can time the market because you think there's a cycle and you want to trade and make a quick buck, you're in the wrong room," he warned. "That's not what this is about."

He argued that both assets are most effective when combined in a portfolio, noting that investors currently favor Gold due to historical "muscle memory" and trust, while Bitcoin is still establishing itself. This distinction comes as Gold recently hit record highs, surging over the last six months, while Bitcoin experienced a significant 40% decline.

Additionally, the panel debated whether Bitcoin's four-year cycle, driven by "halvings," is dead. Experts suggested that the impact of halvings has diminished because the majority of Bitcoin supply is already circulating, and price movements are now heavily influenced by ETF flows and institutional adoption. Panelists warned against trying to time the market for quick profits, emphasizing that Bitcoin is maturing into a long-term macro asset and that the focus should remain on its utility rather than short-term trading cycles.88:Tb38, Bradley Duke หัวหน้าภูมิภาคยุโรปของ Bitwise กล่าวที่งาน Digital Assets Forum London ว่า Gold ทำหน้าที่เป็นเครื่องป้องกันความเสี่ยงในช่วงที่ตลาดตก ในขณะที่ Bitcoin ทำหน้าที่เป็นสินทรัพย์เชิงรุกที่มีศักยภาพในการเติบโตสูงเมื่อตลาดฟื้นตัว เขาโต้แย้งว่าทั้งสองสินทรัพย์ทำงานได้ดีที่สุดเมื่ออยู่ในพอร์ตโฟลิโอเดียวกัน โดยชี้ว่านักลงทุนยังคงเลือก Gold เนื่องจากความคุ้นเคยทางประวัติศาสตร์และความไว้วางใจ ในขณะที่ Bitcoin กำลังอยู่ในระหว่างการสร้างความน่าเชื่อถือ ข้อสังเกตนี้เกิดขึ้นหลังจากที่ Gold ทำระดับสูงสุดใหม่ในช่วง 6 เดือนที่ผ่านมา ในขณะที่ Bitcoin ปรับตัวลงมาถึง 40%

นอกจากนี้ แผงผู้เชี่ยวชาญยังได้ถกเถียงเรื่องวงจร 4 ปีของ Bitcoin ซึ่งขับเคลื่อนโดยเหตุการณ์ "Halving" ว่าได้สิ้นสุดลงแล้วหรือไม่ ผู้เชี่ยวชาญเสนอแนะว่าอิทธิพลของ Halving ได้ลดลงเนื่องจากปริมาณ Bitcoin ส่วนใหญ่ถูกขุดออกมาแล้ว และการเคลื่อนไหวของราคาในปัจจุบันถูกควบคุมโดยกระแสเงินทุนจาก ETF และการรับเลือกโดยสถาบัน ผู้เข้าร่วมงานยังเตือนว่าไม่ควรพยายาม Time the market เพื่อหากำไรรวดเร็ว แต่ควรมุ่งเน้นว่า Bitcoin กำลังเจริญเติบโตขึ้นเป็นสินทรัพย์มหภาคระยะยาว และควรเน้นไปที่ประโยชน์ใช้สอยมากกว่าการเก็งกำไรระยะสั้น89:T88e,In late 2025, the bank piloted a crypto-backed loan with mining firm AO Intelion Data, using self-mined coins as collateral secured via its internal custody system and Rutoken hardware. Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, plans to roll out crypto-backed loans after testing a program in December using self-mined cryptocurrency as collateral, Reuters reported Friday, citing a spokesperson for the bank. The pilot , conducted in collaboration with mining firm AO Intelion Data, aimed to support cooperation with the central bank on crypto regulation and infrastructure, and could extend to any firm holding digital assets, Deputy CEO Anatoly Popov said at the time. According to Sberbank, the upcoming launch is being driven by robust demand from corporate clients. The bank is also broadening its focus to include companies with crypto holdings, in addition to miners. A crypto-backed loan lets borrowers use digital assets as collateral to access fiat or stablecoins. Many banks have begun offering these loans as a high-profit, low-risk way to tap into the digital asset market while addressing the challenges of traditional lending. Wells Fargo, for instance, offers specialized credit lines that include digital assets as part of the collateral package. JPMorgan Chase was reported last year to be preparing to allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as loan collateral. In Russia, Sovcombank became the first major private bank to unlock access to Bitcoin-backed loans. Launched earlier this week, the product caters to companies and individuals legally holding crypto. Apart from the crypto-backed loans, Sberbank is also looking to roll out crypto custody services with account-like safety guarantees and asset-freezing provisions. Crypto is playing a growing role in Russia’s economy and foreign trade, as transactions in most global currencies are targeted by Western sanctions imposed after Russia launched military action in Ukraine. The Russian central bank defines crypto as foreign exchange assets, permitting their purchase and sale but prohibiting domestic payments. The regulator plans to finalize a legislative framework for crypto assets by July 1, 2026.8a:T4ef,Fri, 6/02/2026 - 17:04 After a terrifying plunge to $60,000 that registered 'Extreme Fear' readings not seen since 2020, Bitcoin has staged a stunning rebound to reclaim $70,000 in a single trading session. Cover image via www.youtube.com Bitcoin has just stormed back above the $70,000 psychological threshold, according to data provided by the Bitstamp exchange. It has managed to reach an intraday high of $70,224. On Thursday, a cascade of institutional selling drove the price vertically down. Bitcoin pierced support levels to hit a wick low of approximately $60,000 However, the "V-shaped" recovery has been just as violent as the crash. Bitcoin has rallied over $10,000 from the lows in a matter of hours. You Might Also Like In fact, BTC is now on track to record the biggest one-day gain since March 13, 2023. This date marks the "SVB Crisis" rally. Following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Fed stepped in with the BTFP (Bank Term Funding Program). Bitcoin surged approximately 9.6% in a single day. Since then, there have been remarkably few single-day candles exceeding 10%. However, it remains to be seen whether this recovery will be more than a dead cat bounce, and the bulls are definitely not out of the woods just yet.

Feb 6, 2026, 5:03 p.m. For a brief moment, the digital asset treasury (DAT) was Wall Street’s bright, shiny object. But in 2026, the novelty has worn off. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The star of the “passive accumulator” has dimmed, and rightly so. Investors have realized that simply announcing a bitcoin purchase is no longer a magic trick that guarantees stock appreciation. The easy money trade is over. But this cooling-off period is not a death knell; it is a reckoning. It is stripping away the hype to reveal a stark reality: Dozens of public operating companies are attempting to transform themselves into unregulated hedge funds—often without the risk architecture of a fund or the governance standards of a public company. The playbook was alarmingly simple: raise capital, accumulate cryptocurrency, and pray for appreciation. But as a securities attorney and CEO who has overseen more than $5 billion in capital raises, including as the General Counsel to MARA Holdings during its run to a $6 billion valuation, I know that accumulation is not a sound business strategy. It’s a crapshoot. And as we approach annual reporting deadlines, the bill for those bets is coming due. If the DAT sector is to mature from a speculative frenzy and gain credibility as a respected fintech strategy, we must stop treating governance as an afterthought. It must be the foundation. The risk of the “blind buy” The prevailing DAT model has been defined by a singular mandate: raise cash, buy assets, hold. While this works in a bull market, it exposes shareholders to catastrophic downside in a bear market or during times of volatility, as we’ve all seen recently. Without a clear, articulated strategy for why a specific asset is being chosen or how liquidity will be managed, these companies are essentially gambling with shareholder value. Both retail and institutional investors are beginning to ask harder questions. They are no longer satisfied with“we believe in crypto.” They want to know: How are you balancing capital allocation? What are the specific risks of the protocol you are invested in, and what are you doing in terms of risk mitigation? If the current strategy stalls, do you have a plan B? A fair number of periodic reports filed by DATs today appear to offer generic boilerplate risk factors. They tend to reiterate warnings about volatility and hacking, but fail to address the idiosyncratic risks of their specific treasury assets. This is where the new generation of DATs will need to distinguish themselves to survive and be competitive. Using the annual report as a storytelling tool As reporting deadlines loom, management and counsel at DATs need to revamp their filings. For instance, the Risk Factor section of a 10-K should not be a regurgitation of every risk factor that has appeared on EDGAR, the SEC’s primary digital database; it should be a thoughtful assessment of realistic short- and long-term risks, specifically addressing the issuer's business at hand. A mature DAT must move beyond the basics and explain the trade-offs transparently. Investors deserve to know why a dollar is going into AVAX (or BTC) versus R&D or marketing, and exactly how the company generates solid revenue streams outside of asset appreciation to keep the lights on during a crypto winter. Furthermore, companies must disclose the specific protection mechanisms and controls they have in place to prevent the treasury from becoming a single point of failure. The “governance alpha” The next wave of successful DATs will be defined by their governance architectures. This isn’t just about regulatory compliance; it is about shareholder trust and the fulfillment of fiduciary duty. We recently navigated this at AVAX One. We recognized the insufficiency of simply announcing a pivot to a DAT model, which meant going to our shareholders—the true owners of the capital—and asking for explicit approval for our digital asset strategy. The result was telling. Over 96% of voting shareholders approved the move. This was not just a vote for another crypto treasury. It was a vote mandating a governance strategy for crypto. It gave us a license to operate that “blind buy” DATs simply do not have, and we intend to use that mandate to support fintech through utilizing the Avalanche ecosystem. The regulatory shield Finally, we cannot ignore the SEC and the broader regulatory landscape. While many in the industry view regulation as a hindrance, for a public DAT, it is a necessary and welcome shield. SEC disclosure obligations force a level of transparency that protects shareholders from the worst excesses of the crypto market. It is a strong tool that enables public DATs to distinguish themselves from opaque private entities. By embracing these obligations rather than doing the bare minimum to scrape by, we build a moat of credibility and provide verifiable behavior and safety assurance. We are entering a new phase. The “wild west” days of treasury management are ending. The market will soon punish those who are merely collecting coins and reward those who are building durable, governed financial fortresses.

(Nasdaq: GLXY) has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $200 million, allowing the company to buy back its Class A common stock over the next 12 months. According to a company announcement , the repurchases may be conducted on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and remain subject to applicable securities laws and exchange rules. The program does not obligate Galaxy to repurchase any shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The buyback program has a term of 12 months and, if conducted on the Toronto Stock Exchange, remains subject to regulatory approval under a normal course issuer bid. Purchases made on Nasdaq would be capped at 5% of Galaxy’s outstanding shares at the start of the program, according to the announcement. Galaxy is listed on the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange and operates across digital asset trading, asset management, staking, custody and data center infrastructure. The company did not disclose how much of the $200 million authorization it expects to use, or when repurchases might begin. Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy, said the company is “entering 2026 from a position of strength,” adding that its balance sheet and ongoing investments give it flexibility to return capital when management believes the stock is undervalued. The news comes three days after Galaxy reported a net loss of $482 million for the fourth quarter of 2025 and a $241 million loss for the full year, citing lower digital asset prices and about $160 million in one-time costs. At the time of writing, shares of Galaxy were up about 17% over 24 hours, but remained down about 25% for the month, according to Yahoo Finance.

Read our Editorial Policy https://cointelegraph.com/editorial-policy8d:Tfe4,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 On the macro side, the market’s risk-off mood has hit most risk assets, and short-term holders are usually the first to fold. So far in Q1, pretty much all the big-cap coins are feeling the pressure, with weak hands shaking out. That said, any rebound really comes down to long-term holders keeping their conviction. Take Ethereum [ETH], as an example. It’s roughly 45% off its September peak at $3,500, putting a lot of LTHs underwater. On top of that, Vitalik’s recent comments haven’t helped sentiment. His take on the “copy-paste” approach for L2s and alternative L1s has stirred some extra FUD, leaving traders unsure about ETH’s short-term direction. Source: X That reaction isn’t too surprising though. Lately, Ethereum, and blockchains in general, aren’t really defined by price moves. The real story is deeper adoption, which relies on solid infrastructure rather than “hype.” Buterin’s comments fit that narrative . He recently stressed that scaling should be the focus, instead of just pumping out more L1s, even for EVM chains. The real push should be on innovation, improving privacy, building more apps etc. In short, his vision leans towards long-term growth for blockchain and Ethereum by extension. Naturally, the question arises – Is ETH really setting the stage for the long run, with recent sell-offs just a short-term shakeout? What Ethereum’s metrics say about the road ahead Looking at Ethereum, this breakdown isn’t just profit-taking. In fact, ETH has emerged as the worst-performing asset in this downturn, dropping by about 30% just this week. Consequently, the pullback seems more like a sentiment-driven crash, fueled by forced exits and panic selling. And yet, on-chain metrics might just tell us a different story. Ethereum’s staking rate just hit a new all-time high, with roughly 30.3% of all ETH now staked. Exchange balances have continued to fall sharply too, down to only 16.2 million ETH. Source: CryptoQuant Taken together, this divergence backs AMBCrypto’s thesis. From a technical standpoint, the short-term picture is rough. Rising FUD, ETF outflows, massive deleveraging, and a plunging ETH/BTC ratio have pushed Ethereum’s market share to a multi-month low of under 11%. That said, falling exchange reserves and rising staking volumes (two key metrics of long-term conviction) suggest the market may still be bullish on Buterin’s vision , reinforcing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. In this light, ETH’s recent sell-offs look more like macro-driven volatility and broader risk-off fear, than a problem with Ethereum itself. This makes this pullback feel like a short-term shakeout, rather than a fundamental shift. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s 30–45% pullback and market volatility reflect macro-driven fear and weak-hand exits, not a loss of conviction. Rising staking rates and falling exchange balances mean that long-term holders may be staying bullish on Ethereum.

Ad Disclosure Dogecoin’s open interest has crashed to levels not seen since October 2024. This was notably just before the leading meme coin recorded a significant surge, raising speculation that history might repeat itself. Dogecoin’s open interest has crashed below $1 billion, down over 16%, according to Coinglass data . The last time the open interest dropped to these levels was in October 2024, just before it began an uptrend which led to a high of $4.45 billion in December 2024. October 2024 also marked the bottom for the DOGE price , as it rose from around $0.155 to as high as $0.46. Dogecoin notably rose back then, partly thanks to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory and Elon Musk’s move to name a government agency, the Department of Government Efficiency, after DOGE. Additionally, the Fed lowered rates at the time, which was also bullish for the leading meme coin. Source: Chart from Coinglass It remains to be seen whether Dogecoin can replicate such a price surge this time, given that open interest has dropped to October 2024 levels. It is also worth noting that the current macroeconomic outlook differs this time, with the Fed making a hawkish pivot and unlikely to lower rates until at least June. However, Musk recently mentioned Dogecoin , saying they could send the meme coin to the moon next year. Meanwhile, crypto traders on Binance look to be positioning for a price surge in hopes that this might be the bottom for Dogecoin. The current long/short ratio is 2, indicating that most traders are long. However, DOGE’s long/short ratio across all exchanges is still below 1, indicating that most crypto traders are still bearish and shorting the meme coin. DOGE Still Risks Dropping To $0.054 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has indicated that Dogecoin could still drop to as low as $0.054. In an X post , he stated that this is the level he is looking at for a potential bounce. However, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto suggested that the leading meme coin may not drop to that level, as DOGE’s RSI is currently at a historical level that has acted as support in past cycles. As such, there is the possibility that it could bounce from here. It is worth noting that Dogecoin has seen a surge in metrics, including derivatives trading volume , which has increased by more than 100% to $6.5 billion. Options trading volume and open interest have also surged by 381% and 135%, respectively, indicating that crypto traders are actively trading the meme coin. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.09075, down over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Feb 6, 2026, 5:00 p.m. Wall Street analysts covering Strategy (MSTR) broadly agree on one point after the company’s fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday: the headline losses look dramatic, but they do not signal a liquidity crisis or forced bitcoin selling. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Strategy reported a $17.4 billion operating loss and a $12.6 billion net loss for the quarter, figures driven largely by non-cash mark-to-market accounting tied to bitcoin’s BTC $70,928.29 price decline. Both TD Cowen and Benchmark said the market reaction missed that context, sending shares down about 17% on a day when bitcoin and other risk assets were already under pressure. Shares are higher by 21% on Friday as bitcoin climbs from yesterday's low of $60,000 to back above $70,000. The two analysts agree the core debate centers on solvency, not profitability. Strategy holds 713,502 bitcoin, worth nearly $50 billion at current prices, against about $8.2 billion in convertible debt. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said the company would only face true balance-sheet stress if bitcoin fell below $8,000 and stayed there for years. Management emphasized on the earnings call that none of its debt carries covenants or triggers tied to bitcoin’s price or its average purchase cost. TD Cowen’s Lance Vitanza also focused on the durability of the capital structure. He argued that Strategy was built to amplify bitcoin’s volatility by design, with common equity trading at roughly 1.5 times bitcoin’s swings. That leverage cuts both ways. Vitanza said the company’s $2.25 billion cash reserve and staggered debt maturities mean there is no reasonable scenario where Strategy would be forced to sell bitcoin in the near term, even if prices remain depressed. Where analysts differ is less about risk and more about framing. TD Cowen leaned into Strategy’s role as a “digital credit engine,” highlighting its growing preferred equity business and the liquidity of its STRC preferred stock, which pays an 11.25% annualized dividend. Benchmark placed more weight on bitcoin’s long-term price path and the optionality embedded in Strategy’s equity if bitcoin rallies. Both firms remain constructive on the stock. Benchmark reiterated a Buy rating with a $705 price target, based on a sum-of-the-parts model that assumes bitcoin reaches $225,000 by the end of 2026. TD Cowen also maintained a Buy rating, arguing that Strategy remains one of the most efficient ways for investors to gain leveraged bitcoin exposure outside of ETFs, though it did not disclose a specific price target in its note.

Despite these headline losses, Wall Street analysts from TD Cowen and Benchmark assert that the market reaction was overblown, emphasizing that the company does not face a liquidity crisis or a need to sell its Bitcoin holdings. The shares rebounded by 21% on Friday as Bitcoin recovered above $70,000, following an initial 17% drop.

Analysts stress that the core debate centers on solvency rather than profitability, noting that Strategy holds nearly $50 billion in Bitcoin against $8.2 billion in convertible debt. Benchmark estimates that true balance-sheet stress would only occur if Bitcoin fell below $8,000 and remained there for years, while TD Cowen highlighted the durability of the capital structure and the absence of debt covenants tied to Bitcoin prices. Both firms maintain Buy ratings, viewing Strategy as a high-leverage vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, with Benchmark setting a $705 price target based on Bitcoin reaching $225,000.91:T17de,ADA holding $0.22 with $12 million outflows signals dip-buying strength, not panic selling. Open interest down 41% since January reduces liquidation risk but limits fast upside. $40 million whale accumulation supports recovery, but weak sentiment keeps $0.20 downside risk. Cardano price rebounded sharply after breaking down from a falling channel and sliding nearly 20% to $0.22. The quick 17% recovery toward $0.25 attracted fresh dip buyers. However, with sentiment still weak and key technical risks unresolved, the rebound is now being closely tested. Yet, there are reasons to believe that this ADA price bounce could be the start of something bigger. Strong Buying Shows Real Demand For ADA Cardano’s rebound was possibly backed by strong spot demand. Sponsored Sponsored After falling nearly 20% on February 5, after breaking the falling channel, ADA quickly rebounded , climbing back toward $0.25. The long lower wick seen on the last candle suggests buying pressure near the support. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . Bearish Price Structure: TradingView On the same day when the market crashed, spot netflows flipped sharply negative, reaching around $12.08 million, compared with $2.1 million the previous day. This shows that traders were actively withdrawing ADA from exchanges and accumulating during the crash, rather than preparing to sell. Exchange Flows: Coinglass However, this accumulation is occurring while market sentiment around Cardano remains unusually weak, and that’s the biggest risk at the moment. Positive sentiment has fallen sharply since mid-January, dropping from around 57 to near 6, a 90% dip and a monthly low. Cardano’s strongest moves were often supported by rising optimism, as seen towards the end of January, when a local positive sentiment high coincided with a 9% price bounce. Eroding Sentiment: Santiment Sponsored Sponsored This time, buying pressure and the corresponding bounce are aligning with eroding sentiment, meaning confidence is still weak. Even so, sustained exchange outflows during a panic sell-off remain a constructive signal and form the first pillar of Cardano’s recovery attempt. Derivatives Reset Has Reduced Leverage-Driven Risk The second major factor supporting Cardano’s rebound is the sharp reset in derivatives positioning. Open interest has fallen significantly from its September peak near $1.95 billion and from around $841 million in mid-January to roughly $494.7 million. This represents a decline of more than 40% in less than a month. Cardano Open Interest: Coinglass At the same time, funding rates have turned slightly negative, showing that long positions are no longer aggressively dominant. This matters because many failed rebounds collapse when leverage rebuilds too quickly. Funding Rate: Coinglass Sponsored Sponsored In Cardano’s case, the rebound is forming after a large liquidation and deleveraging event. With open interest compressed and funding neutral to negative, the risk of forced selling from overleveraged longs is currently low. This creates a healthier foundation for price stabilization compared with rebounds driven purely by derivatives speculation. Whale Accumulation Signals Conviction During the Crash Large holders have also shown signs of confidence during the sell-off. The third reason why this ADA price bounce looks healthy. Wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA increased their combined holdings from around 13.41 billion to approximately 13.56 billion since early February, almost $40 million. More importantly, these addresses did not reduce exposure during the sharp drop toward $0.22. Their balances remained stable between February 4 and February 6, even as price volatility spiked. This suggests that mid-sized whales viewed the crash as a buying opportunity rather than a signal to exit. ADA Whales: Santiment In previous market cycles, sustained recoveries were often preceded by this type of quiet accumulation during periods of fear. Still, sentiment data shows that broader market confidence has not yet followed whales higher. Sponsored Sponsored While price rebounded, positive sentiment continued to decline, indicating that retail and media narratives remain cautious. This divergence means the rally is being led by positioning and capital flows, not yet by widespread optimism. Key Cardano Price Levels Will Decide Whether the Recovery Holds All three supporting factors now converge around a narrow price range. The $0.22 zone remains the most important structural support. This level aligns with the recent crash low and the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement. A sustained break below $0.22 would reopen the projected falling channel target (discussed earlier) near $0.20 and invalidate the recovery attempt, especially if sentiment remains depressed. Above current levels, ADA must hold $0.24 and reclaim $0.26 to maintain momentum. Cardano Price Analysis: TradingView A clean breakout above $0.26 could open the path toward $0.30, implying an upside of roughly 20%. However, without a recovery in positive sentiment, upside extensions may struggle to sustain themselves. If the ADA price falls below $0.22 while sentiment remains near monthly lows or negative news emerges, the rebound is likely to fade. That could expose $0.20, the initial channel-breakdown target, which still looms as part of the broader technical risk. If the Cardano price holds and sentiment improves, Cardano could emerge as an early recovery leader, even against some of the bigger names in the crypto space.

Bitcoin’s drop to $60,000 added to the downside momentum, dragging ETH lower until buyers stepped in around $1,753, a level that helped stall the decline and spark a rebound. The recovery lifted the ETH price back above $1,975, suggesting the move lower was largely technically driven rather than event-led. With no major negative catalyst behind the sell-off, rising buying pressure fueled a swift bounce, shifting focus to whether Ethereum can now build on this recovery or if the rebound remains a short-term reaction within a broader range. Weekly Chart Signals Compression Ahead of a Breakout This ETH weekly chart captures a long phase of consolidation that traders often see before a big expansion move. Ethereum has been printing higher lows since the 2022 bottom, while price keeps getting capped near the $3,800–$4,000 resistance zone. The recent move above that level, followed by a sharp pullback, looks like a classic fakeout meant to flush late entries. With the broader structure still intact, this setup leans more toward prolonged accumulation than a trend breakdown. Source: X For traders, the line in the sand sits around $2,800–$3,000, where the higher-low structure is anchored. As long as ETH holds this zone, upside attempts remain valid. A strong weekly close above $4,200 would signal real acceptance and could open the path toward $5,000–$5,500, with $7,000 as the larger breakout target. Losing $2,800 on a weekly close would weaken the setup and point to more sideways or corrective price action. Ethereum Price at a Decision Point Ethereum’s current price action reflects stabilization, not confirmation. After defending the $1,750–$1,900 macro support zone, ETH has managed to rebound above $1,950, but it continues to struggle below the $2,150 resistance, which remains the first level bulls need to reclaim to regain short-term control. From a higher-timeframe perspective, the weekly higher-low structure is still intact, meaning the broader bullish thesis has not been invalidated yet. However, the lack of a strong follow-through move and continued rejection near resistance suggests ETH is still range-bound, not trending. As long as ETH holds above $1,750, the downside risk remains containe,d and the market stays in a positioning phase. A weekly close below $1,700 would weaken the structure and open the door to a deeper correction. On the upside, a reclaim of $2,150, followed by acceptance above the $2,600 mid-range, would be the first signs that Ethereum is preparing for a broader breakout attempt.

Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao sparked a flurry of responses on Monday after tweeting “Poor again” following Bitcoin’s decline to $60,000 in early Asian trading hours on Friday. The comment came amid controversy over Binance’s role in last weekend’s market turbulence, including a sharp sell-off that briefly pushed Bitcoin below $75,000. Retail Frustration Boils Over CZ’s remark ignited a wave of responses from investors. One of the most pointed reactions came from popular crypto commentator, pseudonymously known as “Nebraskangooner,” who tweeted , “You dumped the market, and now you’re mocking everyone for being poor? Weird flex.” His response echoed frustration from retail investors who suffered losses while speculation circulated that Binance may have influenced the market decline. Earlier this week, CZ had addressed multiple allegations he labeled as “pretty imaginative FUD,” as he denied claims that Binance sold $1 billion in Bitcoin to trigger the sell-off and countered criticism that he single-handedly “canceled the crypto supercycle.” He clarified that Binance’s wallet balances indicate user deposits and withdrawals, not proprietary trading, and explained that the conversion of the exchange’s SAFU fund from stablecoins to Bitcoin would be executed gradually over 30 days. CZ also joked that if he had the power to control the supercycle, he would be “snapping his fingers all day long.” Despite these explanations, Nebraskangooner’s response points to the ongoing tension between retail investors and large exchanges. Several crypto community members also blamed Binance for last year’s October 10 crash, which wiped out billions in leveraged positions. Industry peers, including OKX founder Star Xu, had also pointed fingers at Binance following the event. Dismantling Fake Accounts The former Binance CEO recently dismantled a long-running misinformation campaign targeting him and the exchange. The campaign centered on a fake account named “Wei 威 BNB,” which posed as a loyal supporter but posted critical content about Binance. The account, which had 863,000 followers and used images from a BNB Chain event, initially appeared legitimate.

The account’s history also suggested it had either been hacked or sold, as it originally posted only female photos before abruptly switching to crypto content in 2015. CZ called the campaign “lazy” and said it likely came from a competitor more focused on undermining Binance than running their own business.

While the move does not confirm an imminent spot listing, it marks the first formal signal from a major U.S. exchange that Pi could be under consideration for broader market access. The update arrives at a critical moment for Pi, which has been struggling with heavy price pressure and weakening investor confidence. What Kraken’s Roadmap Update Really Means Kraken’s roadmap outlines digital assets that may be listed in the future, subject to regulatory, technical, and liquidity requirements. Pi Network now appears alongside other potential listings such as Conflux and Pepecoin. Importantly, the exchange has not committed to a timeline or guaranteed spot trading support. This development builds on Kraken’s earlier move to launch Pi perpetual futures in 2025. That product allowed traders to take both long and short positions using more than 40 supported collateral assets, increasing Pi’s exposure within derivatives markets even as spot trading remained limited. Pi Network’s Uneven Exchange Presence Currently, Pi Coin is already available for spot trading on exchanges like OKX and Bitget, offering some liquidity to the market. However, the absence of listings on top-tier platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, and Robinhood has remained a major hurdle for broader adoption. In Binance’s case, industry watchers have long speculated about a potential listing, but those expectations have repeatedly stalled. Ongoing leadership controversies within Pi Network appear to be one of the factors dampening progress with major U.S. and global exchanges. Pi Current Market Sentiment Pi Network remains under heavy pressure after sliding 9% on Thursday and breaking below the key $0.1533 support, a level that previously marked the October 10 low. Although the price bounced slightly from a fresh record low near $0.1300, the relief appears limited as bearish momentum still dominates. Technical indicators underline the weakness, with the RSI stuck deep in oversold territory around 20, signaling aggressive selling, while the MACD continues to trend lower in negative territory, reinforcing downside pressure. With momentum tilted firmly toward sellers, PI appears to be entering a price-discovery phase, leaving the $0.100 listing price as the next major reference level. Any meaningful recovery would require a clear reclaim of the $0.1533 zone to ease selling pressure and stabilize price action. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs Is Pi Coin listed on Kraken? No, Pi Coin is not currently listed for spot trading on Kraken. However, Kraken has added Pi Network to its 2026 asset roadmap for potential future listing, following its 2025 launch of Pi perpetual futures contracts. Is Pi Coin available for trading on major exchanges? Pi Coin trades on platforms like OKX and Bitget, but top-tier exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have yet to list it. Why is Pi Coin’s price under pressure? Heavy selling, weak investor confidence, and technical resistance near $0.1533 are driving Pi Coin’s recent price decline. What is the future outlook for Pi Network? The future outlook remains uncertain. While Kraken’s interest is a positive signal, Pi Network faces hurdles like exchange adoption delays and internal controversies. Price recovery requires stabilizing above previous key support levels.

While the price drop briefly resembled a broader market breakdown, available data suggests the episode was driven by a localized system error rather than a systemic liquidity failure. Bitcoin on Bithumb’s won-denominated market fell more than 17% within minutes, briefly touching around ₩81.5 million before rebounding. Prices on global exchanges remained comparatively stable, highlighting that the disruption was largely confined to one venue. What went wrong at Bithumb According to industry reports, the incident stemmed from a computer error during an internal compensation or event payout process. Roughly 2,000 BTC was mistakenly credited to the accounts of hundreds of users. Each account briefly reflected balances worth hundreds of billions of won at prevailing market prices. The error appears to have been a classic “fat-finger” or system input failure rather than a deliberate transfer. Crucially, the credited balances existed only within Bithumb’s internal ledger and were not fully backed by immediately withdrawable on-chain reserves. Why users couldn’t withdraw the credited Bitcoin Despite the scale of the erroneous balances, a full-blown bank run did not materialize. Industry sources estimate that Bithumb’s actual Bitcoin holdings are around 50,000 BTC , far below the notional amount implied by the mistaken credits. Bithumb’s limited available reserves prevented users from moving the majority of the wrongly credited Bitcoin off the platform, even as internal balances temporarily showed far higher figures. Forced selling triggers a local flash crash While mass withdrawals were blocked, selling was not. Some users who recognized the error quickly sold their credited Bitcoin into Bithumb’s order books. Estimates suggest that over 500 BTC was dumped in a short time window. That sudden sell pressure overwhelmed local liquidity, sending Bitcoin prices on Bithumb sharply lower relative to other exchanges. Source: TradingView The result was a classic flash crash: a steep, rapid decline followed by a partial rebound once selling pressure subsided and trading was halted. Bithumb subsequently suspended deposits and withdrawals and initiated an internal system review, aiming to prevent further disorderly trading. On-chain data confirms abnormal exchange flows Exchange netflow data shows a sharp spike in Bitcoin outflows from Bithumb during the incident window, consistent with panic selling and internal settlement activity. However, these flows did not propagate meaningfully across other major exchanges. As of this writing, the netflow was negative of around 3,000 BTC . Source: CryptoQuant Importantly, there was no corresponding surge in global exchange inflows or sustained selling pressure elsewhere, reinforcing the view that the disruption was exchange-specific rather than market-wide. A local dislocation, not a systemic Bitcoin event Price charts tell the same story. While Bitcoin on Bithumb’s KRW pair experienced extreme volatility, USD-denominated markets showed only routine movement by comparison. The broader market did not register the kind of synchronized sell-off typically associated with macro shocks or liquidity crises. This divergence underscores a key distinction: price distortions caused by internal exchange mechanics can appear dramatic even if they do not reflect broader market sentiment or fundamentals. Final Thoughts The Bithumb incident was driven by an internal balance error that triggered forced selling, not by a collapse in Bitcoin’s broader market structure. While the flash crash was contained, it underscores how operational failures at centralized exchanges can still create sharp, localized market shocks.97:T12c0,In brief China’s central bank and regulators have issued a notice that bans unapproved issuance of renminbi-pegged stablecoins, including those offshore. Most real-world asset tokenization is now classified as illegal outside approved infrastructure. The move follows earlier crackdowns on speculative crypto, RWA tokenization, and Hong Kong-linked stablecoin plans. China’s central bank and nine other regulators have moved to lock in a sweeping crackdown on crypto-related activity, issuing a joint notice on Friday that bans unapproved yuan-linked stablecoin issuance, classifying most real-world asset tokenization as illegal. The notice frames virtual currencies, stablecoins, and tokenized assets as sources of systemic financial risk, reaffirming that cryptocurrencies lack legal tender status and that related trading, issuance, and intermediary services constitute illegal financial activity unless explicitly approved by authorities. Speculative activities in relation to virtual currencies and real-world asset tokenization have been “disrupting economic and financial order and endangering the property safety of the people,” a translation of the note reads. To maintain “national security and social stability,” the central bank and regulators involved have affirmed their stance that virtual currencies have no legal status equivalent to fiat money and “should not and cannot be used as currency for circulation in the market.” They add that “virtual currency-related business activities constitute illegal financial activities,” and that exchange services, trading, token issuance, and crypto-linked financial products are “strictly prohibited across the board and shall be resolutely banned according to law.” Any unapproved overseas issuance of renminbi-linked stablecoins have also been barred. Unlicensed RWA tokenization banned Separately, the notice defines real-world asset tokenization as the use of cryptographic and distributed ledger technologies to turn asset ownership or income rights into tokens for issuance and trading. Such activities, including related intermediary or technical services, are to be treated as illegal financial activity unless explicitly approved and carried out within designated financial infrastructure, the Chinese authorities said. Decrypt has reached out to the People’s Bank of China for comment and will update this story should it respond. China’s crypto crackdown Friday’s notice comes as Chinese authorities have signaled a renewed crackdown on speculative crypto trading, warning late last year that a rebound in offshore platforms and token activity was drawing domestic participation despite existing bans. The bans appear to be geared towards guarding the digital yuan against “private offshore competition that could facilitate capital flight and undermine monetary sovereignty,” Jamie Green, COO at Superset, a unified liquidity execution layer for stablecoins, told Decrypt . “By demanding prior approval for any renminbi-linked tokens, Beijing is ensuring that the state remains the gatekeeper of the digital renminbi's footprint globally,” he added. The notice, Green said, operates as an example of "regulatory enclosure" in which a state authority takes “a nascent industry” and forces it “into a state-approved bottle.” Reclassifying RWA tokenization as "illegal financial activity” means regulators are forcing Chinese firms to either “abandon decentralized RWA initiatives entirely, or migrate them to permissioned, state-monitored infrastructure within the mainland,” he explained. This marks China’s first crypto ban of 2026, adding to a long line of restrictions imposed over the past decade, Christian Ruz, business strategy director at crypto agency Hype, told Decrypt . “Chinese investors already know how to survive these restrictions and they know their risks of holding renminbi is higher than holding U.S.-pegged stablecoins,” Ruz said, adding that he doesn’t anticipate much impact from the move given that most stablecoin and RWA firms are global in scale. Chinese regulators previously directed brokers and financial institutions to suspend real-world asset tokenization activities linked to Hong Kong, citing regulatory concerns. The move affected tokenization projects tied to mainland interests despite Hong Kong’s separate licensing regime . Authorities have also intervened in plans by major technology firms to pursue stablecoin projects connected to China through Hong Kong. Those initiatives were paused following regulatory guidance that limited private involvement in stablecoin issuance tied to the renminbi.

While crowd sentiment has flipped deeply bearish, on-chain data shows rising whale exchange activity, adding complexity to Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Crowd Psychology Turns Deeply Bearish After Sharp Selloff When markets fall aggressively, expectations often follow price. After BTC price slipped to $60,000, social sentiment quickly shifted toward calls for “lower” and “below,” signaling widespread fear among retail participants. Historically, such spikes in bearish crowd language tend to occur closer to local inflection zones rather than continuation peaks. Meanwhile, data tracking social volume suggests that pessimism has intensified rather than faded during the rebound toward $69,500. This imbalance indicates that confidence in the recovery remains fragile, even as price attempts to stabilize. Still, extreme fear phases often reduce immediate selling pressure, particularly if weaker hands have already exited. That said, the ongoing recovery raises an very important question on the BTC price chart: is this merely mechanical short covering, or a response to sentiment exhaustion? Since, markets rarely move in straight lines, and violent declines are often followed by reflexive rebounds. From a technical perspective, BTC price USD is hovering just above the weekly 200-EMA band, an area closely watched by long-term participants. A sustained hold above this region could allow price to revisit higher liquidity zones crossing the $70,000 area towards $80K-$85K. However, failure to defend this band would increase downside exposure toward the mid-$50,000s. Whale Exchange Activity Adds Caution to the Setup At the same time, on-chain behavior introduces a more defensive note. The Exchange Whale Ratio on Binance, smoothed over 30 days, has climbed to 0.447, its highest reading since March 2025. This suggests that large holders now account for a disproportionate share of exchange inflows. Historically, elevated whale ratios coincide with phases of distribution or hedging rather than accumulation. As shown on the chart, this spike aligns closely with Bitcoin’s recent price decline, reinforcing the idea that larger players remain active on the sell side. Until this metric begins to cool, downside risk remains structurally present. Contradictory Signals Keep BTC Price Range-Bound Still, the divergence between retail fear and whale pressure creates a complex environment. While extreme pessimism among smaller participants can support short-term rebounds, continued whale dominance in exchange inflows limits upside follow-through. From a broader lens, BTC crypto markets appear to be undergoing a reset rather than a directional trend. If price stabilizes above key moving averages, the BTC price prediction narrative could temporarily shift toward consolidation or relief rallies. Conversely, renewed weakness below support could open the path toward the $53,000 region, where prior demand has historically emerged. In this context, BTC price remains caught between sentiment exhaustion and structural selling, making the coming weeks particularly sensitive to crowd behavior and on-chain flow shifts.

Summary The crypto crash accelerated this week as most coins tumbled. The Fear and Greed Index has fallen to extreme levels. Technical analysis suggests that it has become highly oversold. Why the crypto crash is happening The ongoing crypto market retreat is influenced by a mix of global economic concerns and investor sentiment. Rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran have added uncertainty, with both sides issuing warnings that any escalation could impact the region and potentially affect oil prices. However, there are no confirmed reports of U.S. military action, and any link between geopolitical fears and crypto price movements is speculative. Bitcoin and altcoins also dropped as investors rotated out of risk assets and into value ones. A good example of this is the stock market, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has slumped, while value ETFs like the Vanguard Value ETF and the Schwab US Dividend ETF have soared to record highs. Additionally, the rising crypto ETF outflows and soaring liquidations put more pressure on these assets. Spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs shed over $689 million in assets this year and are in their fourth consecutive month in the red. Similarly, Ethereum ETFs have shed over $149 million in assets. Crypto liquidations have also soared in the past few days. That jumped by over 122% in the last 24 hours to over $2 billion. On the positive side There are some key signs that suggest a crypto recovery is coming soon. First, the Crypto Fear and Index has slipped to 5. That’s the lowest level in years. In most cases, crypto bull runs normally start when the index moves to the extreme fear zone. Similarly, crypto prices typically drop when they move into the extreme greed zone. A good example of this is what happened in December, when it moved into the extreme greed zone at 10. Bitcoin and other altcoins rebounded in January, with BTC nearing $100,000. Before that, the index moved to the extreme fear zone in April last year and then rebounded to a record high after Trump changed his tune on tariffs. Crypto Fear and Greed Index chart | Source: CMC Technical analysis also suggests that Bitcoin may rebound soon. For example, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index has moved to the oversold level of 27 for the first time since November 2022. Bitcoin has always rebounded whenever it moved to these oversold levels. At the same time, Bitcoin has fallen to the rising wedge target. As the chart below shows, the widest point of this pattern was ~42%. It has then fallen by over 42% from the breakout point. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news9b:T968,Pi Network price stabilized near its all-time low as optimism rose that it would be listed on Kraken, a top crypto exchange. Summary Pi Network price crashed to a record low amid the ongoing crypto crash. Kraken, a top crypto exchange, has added it to its listing roadmap. Technical analysis suggests that it has more downside to go in the coming days. Pi Network ( PI ) rose to $0.1450, a few points above the all-time low of $0.1300. It remains significantly lower than the all-time high of $3, with its market capitalization falling from nearly $20 billion to $1.3 billion today. One major catalyst for the coin is its addition to Kraken’s page for potential listings. It is listed in the Chains category, which also includes tokens such as TX, Conflux, Pepecoin, MegaETH, and Quai. Being listed on this page does not guarantee future listing. However, it has given the community hope that it will be available on one of the largest crypto exchanges today. Kraken has over 15 million users globally, with 1.5 million active each month. It generated over $2.2 billion in revenue last year and raised $800 million at a $20 billion valuation in November ahead of its IPO . A Kraken listing would be a big thing as Pi has failed to attract any additional exchanges since its mainnet launch in February last year. Most of its trading occurs on a handful of exchanges, including OKX, Gate, Bitget, and MEXC. Additionally, the listing will likely encourage more exchanges to list it as well. Some of the most important exchanges that would trigger a Pi Coin price surge are Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit. Binance is the most important, while Coinbase and Upbit have large market shares in the US and South Korea. Pi Network price technical analysis Pi Coin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily timeframe chart shows that the Pi coin price has been in a steep freefall in the past few months. It dropped to a record low of $0.1304 as the crypto market crash intensified, The coin has moved below all moving averages and the crucial support level at $0.1530, its previous all-time low. All oscillators are pointing downward, indicating that downward momentum is continuing. Therefore, the most likely Pi Network price outlook is bearish, with the next key target being the psychological $0.10 level. However, the main risk of going against it is that a Kraken listing would fuel a short-term short squeeze.9c:T10bc,CZR Exchange has officially launched a comprehensive rebrand alongside a significantly upgraded trading platform, marking a pivotal step in the exchange’s long-term strategy. The update goes beyond visual changes, introducing deeper infrastructure improvements and native integration of the platform’s utility token, $CZR, as a core component of its ecosystem. According to the company, the rebrand reflects a broader transformation of CZR Exchange from a conventional crypto trading venue into a utility-driven platform designed to support sustainable growth and user alignment over time. A Structural Upgrade, Not a Cosmetic One While rebranding is common across the crypto industry, CZR Exchange says its latest update was driven by structural priorities rather than aesthetics. The upgraded platform features a redesigned interface focused on speed and usability, alongside backend performance enhancements aimed at improving execution reliability and scalability. The exchange has also implemented a modular system architecture, allowing new features and services to be introduced without disrupting core operations. This design is intended to support ongoing development as the platform expands its product offerings. Charlie Rothkopf, Founder of CZR Exchange, emphasized that the rebrand represents a foundational rebuild rather than a surface-level refresh. “This was about rethinking how the exchange operates at both a technical and economic level,” Rothkopf said. “$CZR is embedded directly into the platform to support real utility and long-term participation.” $CZR Utility Embedded Into the Exchange Experience A central element of the rebrand is the native integration of the $CZR token across the platform. Rather than existing as a standalone asset, $CZR is built directly into key exchange functions, including trading fees, rewards, and user status tiers. Users can benefit from trading fee reductions, accelerated access to VIP levels, ecosystem incentives, and eligibility for future premium tools and features. By tying these functions directly to token usage, CZR Exchange aims to align user activity with platform growth through a shared economic framework. The exchange stated that this approach is designed to encourage participation based on utility and engagement, rather than short-term speculation. Phase One of a Broader Ecosystem Roadmap The newly launched platform represents the first phase of CZR Exchange’s broader roadmap. Future phases are expected to expand the role of $CZR across additional services, including payments, identity-based solutions, rewards systems, and other financial tools. By establishing token utility at the infrastructure level early on, CZR Exchange is positioning $CZR to scale alongside platform adoption rather than being retrofitted at a later stage. Looking Ahead With its rebrand now live, CZR Exchange is entering its next phase focused on ecosystem expansion and long-term execution. The company says its goal is to build a scalable, utility-driven exchange model that balances performance, usability, and economic alignment.

The firm dropped more than 119,000 shares of COIN, now valued around $19 million after COIN's Friday rebound. Despite selling COIN, Ark added shares in crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) and Solana firm Brera Holdings (SLMT) on Thursday. Ark Invest, the firm of noted tech investor Cathie Wood, sold more than $19 million in shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) on Thursday—just days after buying more COIN—as Bitcoin’s price fell rapidly to a bottom of nearly $60,000. The firm sold 119,236 shares of COIN across three of its actively managed ETFs as shares of COIN fell to their lowest price since last March. Shares in the American crypto exchange have now fallen almost 48% over the last six months, despite a jump of nearly 9% on Friday to change hands around $159.13. The COIN sale comes just days after Wood’s firm had added to its Coinbase position , according to data from Cathie’s Ark . Coinbase represents Ark Invest’s seventh-largest investment, currently valued around $425 million worth, across its various ETFs. While it reduced its position in the exchange, the firm also added to other positions of crypto-related equities as crypto prices fell, with Bitcoin dropping to a low of $60,255 and ETH falling to $1,756. Even with prices ticking back up Friday, BTC remains down about 17% on the week at a price near $69,000, with Ethereum showing a 27% dive over the last seven days as ETH sits just under $2,000. Despite dumping COIN shares, Ark added more than 716,000 shares of crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) on Thursday, now valued at more than $19 million as BLSH trades around $27.00—up almost 8% a day after crypto stocks plunged. Ark now maintains around $138 million worth of shares in Bullish, which reported Q4 losses of around $536 million on Thursday. Wood’s firm also added to its stash of shares in Brera Holdings (SLMT), also known as Solmate, a Solana treasury and infrastructure company. The addition, 150,000 shares—now valued around $172,500—comes despite the fact that all major crypto treasury firms are now underwater on their digital assets as crypto prices, including Solana ’s, fell heavily on Thursday. SOL, which has underperformed its major peers Bitcoin and Ethereum , has dropped 39% in the last month and is now 71% off its January 2025 all-time high, changing hands recently at $84.01. Ark Invest’s Thursday acquisitions, which also included shares in Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG), come amid broader concerns and macroeconomic uncertainty around artificial intelligence (AI). But Wood remains adamant that AI is not the bubble to fear, instead pointing to the rise in precious metals like gold as the real markets bubble.

Summary $62,500 marks multi-year channel support , active since March 2021 Confluence with value area high strengthens the bounce , increasing reaction probability Accumulation is required , to confirm a sustainable move toward the channel midpoint Bitcoin ( BTC ) price action has recently reacted from a major technical support zone that has defined market structure for several years. After an extended bearish expansion, BTC has revisited the lower boundary of a multi-year ascending channel that has remained intact since March 2021. This reaction has drawn renewed attention from traders, as the level coincides with additional technical confluence that historically has led to meaningful high-timeframe pivots. While short-term volatility remains elevated, the broader structure suggests Bitcoin may be entering a critical decision phase. Whether this bounce develops into a sustained recovery or fails into another leg lower will largely depend on how the price behaves around this key support region in the coming sessions. Bitcoin price key technical points $62,500 aligns with multi-year channel low , active since March 2021 Confluence with value area high strengthens support , increasing reaction probability Accumulation behavior is needed , to confirm a sustainable rotation higher BTCUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView From a higher-timeframe perspective, Bitcoin’s current location is technically significant. The multi-year channel, which has guided price action since early 2021, has consistently acted as both support and resistance during major market cycles. Each historical retest of the channel’s lower boundary has resulted in strong reactions, often marking the transition from bearish phases into broader recovery structures. The recent bounce from the $62,500 region once again highlights the importance of this channel. This level not only represents the channel low but also aligns with the value area high of the prior range, adding further structural relevance. When multiple high-timeframe levels converge, the probability of a meaningful reaction increases substantially. Importance of holding value area support Beyond the channel structure, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the value area high is a key factor in determining whether this move can evolve into a sustained rotation. Acceptance above this region suggests that buyers are willing to transact at higher prices following the recent sell-off, a necessary condition for trend stabilization. If price continues to defend this zone on a closing basis, it reinforces the idea that the recent bearish expansion may be transitioning into a consolidation or accumulation phase. Failure to hold, however, would indicate that demand remains insufficient and could expose Bitcoin to another test of lower liquidity zones. Accumulation phase remains the missing piece Although the initial bounce is technically constructive, confirmation remains incomplete without evidence of accumulation. Accumulation phases typically follow sharp bearish expansions and are characterized by sideways price action, declining volatility, and gradual absorption of supply by stronger hands. In Bitcoin’s case, such a phase would help establish a durable base around the $62,000–$63,000 region. Without this basing behavior, any upside movement risks being corrective rather than trend-defining. Traders should closely monitor volume behavior, as rising participation during consolidation signals increasing confidence among buyers. Potential rotation toward channel midpoint If accumulation develops and support remains intact, the technical roadmap opens the door to a rotational move toward the midpoint of the multi-year channel. Historically, these rotations have provided substantial upside opportunities, particularly when initiated from channel extremes. However, it is important to distinguish between a rotation and a full trend reversal. While a move toward the channel midpoint would be constructive, reclaiming higher resistance levels would still be required to confirm a broader bullish continuation. What to expect in the coming price action From a market structure, price action, and support perspective, the $62,000–$62,500 region represents a pivotal zone for Bitcoin. Holding above this level keeps the multi-year channel intact and supports the case for a developing bottom. A failure to maintain support would invalidate the bullish rotation thesis and reopen downside risk. For now, Bitcoin remains at a high-timeframe inflection point. Confirmation through basing, accumulation, and improving volume will be essential before declaring a definitive bottom. Until then, traders should expect volatility and remain focused on how price behaves around this critical support zone.9f:T660,Bitcoin crashed to $55,000 on Bithumb after exchange accidentally airdropped users 2,000 BTC An internal reward distribution mistake briefly sent bitcoin prices sharply lower on South Korea’s Bithumb exchange after users were mistakenly credited with large phantom balances. Feb 6, 2026, 4:14 p.m. Bitcoin BTC $65,998.81 suffered a flash crash to $55,000 on South Korean exchange Bithumb this week after what appears to have been a major internal accounting error. Bithumb mistakenly credited users with 2,000 BTC each instead of a small reward worth 2,000 Korean won (about $1.50), according to a blog post on Friday. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The result was tens of millions of dollars’ worth of phantom bitcoin appearing in hundreds of user accounts. No bitcoin was moved onchain, and inflated balances existed only in Bithumb's internal ledger. Users who suddenly saw enormous balances wasted little time trying to sell, triggering a sharp selloff on Bithumb’s BTC/KRW pair, sending prices 15.8% below other exchanges. At one point, BTC traded at 81 million won ($55,000) while prices elsewhere remained relatively stable. Bithumb said it identified the abnormal transactions through internal controls and restricted trading in the affected accounts shortly after the incident. The exchange said prices on its platform normalized within about five minutes and that its liquidation prevention system operated as intended, preventing any cascading forced liquidations linked to the price movement. The company added that the incident was not related to an external hack or security breach and that customer assets remain secure.a0:T9f6,The set of new rules reaffirm China’s hardline stance on crypto and impose restrictions on tokenized real-world assets and overseas issuance of yuan stablecoins. Feb 6, 2026, 4:10 p.m. Chinese regulators have broadened their crackdown on crypto activities, imposing strict oversight on tokenization and stablecoin issuance in a Friday notice . "Recently, influenced by various factors, speculative activities related to virtual currencies and the tokenization of real-world assets have occurred frequently, posing new challenges and situations for risk prevention and control," said the notice, issued jointly by eight national organizations including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). STORY CONTINUES BELOW The notice reiterates China’s blanket ban on crypto, saying that trading, issuing or facilitating transactions involving digital currencies such as bitcoin BTC $65,998.81 , ether ETH $1,926.58 , or stablecoins like Tether's USDT USDT $0.9991 is illegal. The prohibition extends to foreign entities and individuals offering such services within China. It also bans domestic entities from issuing digital currencies overseas without regulatory approval. The notice singles out stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies — for special scrutiny. Authorities argue stablecoins replicate key functions of sovereign money and therefore threaten monetary control. The new rules make clear that no entity, Chinese or foreign, may issue a stablecoin linked to the renminbi abroad without government approval. That includes overseas branches of domestic firms. The rules also tighten control over tokenization, the fast-growing trend of turning ownership of real-world assets like equities, real estate or funds into digital tokens. Chinese firms that want to tokenize assets overseas now must obtain approvals or file with regulators, and their financial and tech partners are required to meet heightened compliance standards, the notice said. China's crackdown on cryptocurrencies and related activities have been a staple over the past years. The new set of rules build on Chinese authorities in 2021 deeming all crypto-related business activities illegal and prohibiting crypto mining, often called a "China ban." In 2017, authorities banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), labeling them as illegal fundraising and financial fraud, and ordered domestic cryptocurrency exchanges to shutter fiat-to-crypto trading operations.

The project, which aims to "keep the dollar digital" and provide "loans for institutions and everyday users," has launched a stablecoin called USD1 and a DeFi platform, World Liberty Markets. The Trump family's involvement in World Liberty Financial has sparked accusations of corruption from Democratic lawmakers, and a formal investigation into its dealings with a UAE-based firm. U.S. President Donald Trump has a long list of crypto ventures, profiting to the tune of some $1.4 billion as of January 2026. Of them, a DeFi project dubbed World Liberty Financial might be the biggest. The platform, which President Trump co-founded, according to its website , along with his three sons, wants to make finance "reliable, open, and made for how the world works today." World Liberty Financial was announced by President Trump's son Eric in August 2024. It is led by DeFi builders Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, along with other members of the Trump family and Zach Witkoff—son of longtime Trump ally Steve Witkoff. An Ethereum-based DeFi project Built atop multiple chains including Ethereum , Arbitrum and Berachain , World Liberty Financial says it plans to "keep the dollar digital" and provide "loans for institutions and everyday users." DeFi—short for decentralized finance —is the sphere of the crypto industry that wants to replace traditional banking. DeFi projects, financial platforms that operate without third-party intermediaries, are usually apps built using Ethereum , the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency, ETH . The project’s lending and borrowing platform World Liberty Markets launched in January 2026, promising to offer users “access to transparent, high-performance liquidity markets” powered by DeFi yield protocol Dolomite. World Liberty Markets is now live, built to give users access to transparent, high-performance liquidity markets provided by @dolomite_io . You can earn on supplied assets or borrow against your portfolio with fast, flexible liquidity. WLFI Markets is designed to make these tools… — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) January 12, 2026 It's worth noting that while there are plenty of DeFi apps, the space is still a highly experimental part of the crypto industry and has been plagued by hacks and scams. Those in the DeFi space typically say they want to streamline a slow and expensive legacy banking system, and World Liberty Financial so far has sold itself as the quintessential DeFi project: A borrowing and lending platform that will "unlock financial access for all, by replacing the limits of traditional banking with open, on-chain infrastructure, creating a fairer system—where opportunity isn't defined by location, status, or permission." What can you do with World Liberty Financial? While you can't yet take loans out using the platform, you can buy its native token, WLFI , which has a market cap of $3.05 billion as of February 2026, making it the 34th biggest cryptocurrency in existence, per CoinGecko data . WLFI is available on crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. The project also has its own stablecoin, USD1 , which Decrypt first revealed in October 2024. The stablecoin runs on Ethereum and BNB Chain , Solana, Tron and Plume Network, and is available on American exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken . Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of fiat currencies—in USD1’s case, the U.S. dollar. The assets are a key part of the DeFi economy (and the wider crypto economy) because traders use them to swiftly enter and exit digital asset transactions. Instead of using dollars on traditional banking rails, digital tokens accelerate the crypto trading process. In January 2026, World Liberty Financial filed an application with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to form a national trust bank. The proposal would place its USD1 stablecoin under direct federal supervision, rather than the current structure designed for state-licensed entities. Under the proposal, an entity named as World Liberty Trust Company would take over the issuance and redemption of USD1, as well as offering conversion and custody services from fiat and other stablecoins, and reserve management for the assets backing outstanding USD1. The Trump family's involvement President Trump is listed as "co-founder emeritus" on the World Liberty Financial website, meaning he is no longer involved in the project since taking office in January. His close friend and the White House's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is also listed as a "co-founder emeritus." Still, the Trump and Witkoff families have likely made a lot of money from the project: Steve Witkoff's son, Zach, is the CEO, and the president's three sons, Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron, are listed as co-founders on the project's website . The firm asserts that Trump and his family members do not hold any role as “director, officer or employee” of the firm. WLFI's market cap is more than twice that of the meme coin President Trump launched ahead of his inauguration, Official Trump (TRUMP) . The Trump family owns a significant portion of the WLFI supply; their net worth grew by over $6 billion when the tokens started trading in September 2025. Conflict of interest concerns The Trump family's involvement in WLFI has proved contentious. Democratic lawmakers have frequently criticized the project—and the president's other crypto ventures. In May 2025, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took aim at a $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund MGX into leading crypto exchange Binance, which used the USD1 token, calling it "shady." Prominent House Democrats have also asked the Treasury to provide access to all suspicious activity reports, or SARs, on Trump's digital asset projects—including World Liberty Financial. In February 2026, a Wall Street Journal report revealed that Aryam Investment 1, a UAE firm controlled by ‘Spy Sheikh’ Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, purchased a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial for $500 million, days before Trump's inauguration. According to the WSJ ’s reporting, some $187 million was directed to Trump family entities and $31 million to entities affiliated with Steve Witkoff's family under the deal. Months later, the Trump administration approved export licenses on advanced AI chips to the UAE—licenses previously blocked by the Biden administration over fears the technology could be diverted to China. Denounced by Warren as “corruption, plain and simple,” news of the deal prompted Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) to warn of “potentially criminal conduct” that could result in jail time for those who had “traded government favors for cash.” Days later, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA-17) formally launched an investigation into the deal, demanding that World Liberty Financial hand over documents relating to its dealings with Aryam Investment 1, along with payment flows, due diligence on UAE-linked entities, internal conflict-of-interest safeguards, and communications relating to export controls or the later pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Trump has repeatedly brushed aside concerns over his family’s involvement with crypto ventures including World Liberty Financial, claiming he "hasn't looked" at the profits.

Shiba Inu fell to a never-before-seen-low of $0.00000507 in the intraday session on Friday. The last time Shiba Inu traded near this level was in September 2021, when it reached $0.00000510. The broader crypto market extended its sell-off on Friday, with several cryptocurrencies, including Shiba Inu, plunging deeper into losses. In the last 24 hours, $2.44 billion were liquidated in leveraged bets across the crypto market, according to CoinGlass data. A total of $1.9 billion of this figure was long positions expecting the market to rebound, while short positions accounted for $535 million. HOT Stories SHIB/USD Monthly Chart. Courtesy: TradingView Cryptocurrencies have been on shaky ground following a brutal sell-off last October, which sapped market confidence. Selling increased this week in line with an unwinding of leveraged bets and broader market volatility. Where to from here? Shiba Inu marked three days of declines from February, with Thursday's drop being the largest as SHIB fell from $0.0000067 to $0.00000558. The drop continued on Friday, pushing SHIB to a rare low of $0.00000507 as it plunged to oversold levels. Shiba Inu afterward rebounded, reaching $0.00000620. Shiba Inu had slightly recovered, also still trading in red, down 3.44% in the last 24 hours to $0.00000615 and down 16% weekly. You Might Also Like Amid the drop, crypto market sentiment fell to its lowest level since the FTX collapse, as the Fear and Greed Index dropped to 9, signaling "extreme fear" as traders adjusted their positioning amid the market crash. In previous cycles, extreme fear has often coincided with local bottoms, mostly because panic sentiment tends to flush out leveraged traders and short-term holders. This rebound scenario will be watched for in coming sessions. A positive precedent was set the last time SHIB traded near the $0.000005 low. Shiba Inu increased 830% in the following month, after hitting a low of $0.0000051 in September 2021 to reach an ATH of $0.000088 in October 2021. Next key resistances for Shiba Inu lie at $0.0000077 and $0.00001 (the daily MA 50 and 200) in the event that the market rebounds.

Bitcoin surged 10% to $66,800 just a day after a 17% crash, while the S&P 500 took only a 0.47% upside, causing Wall Street to take notice. Popular TV host Jim Cramer points to the phenomenon of "leverage rotation," saying investors sold their stocks to capitalize on Bitcoin. The setup shows a bigger change — Bitcoin is separating itself from regular markets when things get stressful. Gold and silver also rose, but neither matched BTC's upside pull. Crypto is making a comeback after losing ground in a liquidation death spiral, and equities are feeling the impact. The Bitcoin rally's impact on the S&P shows you the leverage that's in the system. People sold the S&P to finance their bitcoin HOT Stories — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) February 6, 2026 The result is not just an anomaly — it is a sign that capital may be exiting stocks for something riskier this Friday. Bitcoin becomes Wall Street's leverage According to Cramer, the rally on Bitcoin (BTC) showed just how much leverage is built into the system. His theory is that investors are offloading their S&P 500 positions to put their money into Bitcoin instead. Whether it is meant as serious criticism or just a general assessment, the data seems to back up his point. And it is not just stocks taking a hit.

Related articlesa5:Td27,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 After sealing its lead on stablecoins, Tether, issuer of the world’s largest on-chain dollar, USDT, is now betting on similar success through tokenized gold. The firm recently announced a $150 million investment in Gold.com, a well-known platform for the physical retail gold and precious metals market. This highlighted Tether’s broader strategy to scale and replicate its stablecoin-like moat in the physical gold sector. The deal will let Tether own 3.37 million common shares of Gold.com, or about 12% of the total shares. The deal will also grant it the right to elect a board member on the platform. According to a statement , the investment will help Gold.com lease some of Tether’s gold facilities. In return, the platform will invest $20 million in Tether’s tokenized gold, XAUT, and promote its dollar-based stablecoin offerings (USDT and USAT). “The collaboration is expected to enhance the credibility and distribution of Tether’s gold-backed XAU₮ stablecoin, expand Gold.com’s retail and digital offerings, introduce gold leasing solutions, and drive increased consumer and institutional engagement across both platforms.” For the unfamiliar, a similar distribution-led strategy was used by the firm to scale USDT into a global dominant player in the USD-denominated stablecoin market. USDT began on the Bitfinex exchange, which is owned by the same parent firm as Tether. Soon, USDT was listed on Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, and others, eventually becoming the foundation of global crypto liquidity. Tether is using this tested plan for XAUT, its tokenized gold. In June 2025, the firm invested $100 million in Elemental Altus Royalties, a Canadian-based outlet focusing on gold-linked royalties. Similarly, in October 2025, it poured $200 million into Antalpha, a financial services platform, to advance custody, lending, and infrastructure for tokenised gold. To cap it all off, Tether has become the top private gold buyer in 2025, acquiring 27 tons of physical gold in Q4 alone. Interestingly, the firm has also been investing in gold-related media houses, according to a research firm. All roads lead to XAUT for now. Reacting to the Gold.com investment, Juan Sartori, Head of Special Projects at Tether, said, “We are strengthening XAU₮’s transparency, scalability, and its ability to move seamlessly between physical and digital markets.” In fact, even the firm’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, hasn’t shied away from their aggressive gold strategy. He recently told Bloomberg, “We are soon becoming basically one of the biggest, let’s say, gold central banks in the world.” Ardoino framed the move as long-term positioning amid weakening trust in the fiat-based monetary system. Tokenized gold wars – Will Tether lose to Paxos? XAUT’s market cap rose sharply in late 2025 and early 2026 as gold printed new highs. However, the gold market’s recent cool-off dragged it below $3 billion and Paxos’s PAX Gold [PAXG] has been aggressively pushing to become a dominant player. At press time, it had a 42% market share compared to Tether’s 47%. Source: Coingecko Final Thoughts Tether’s $150 million investment and recent gold bets mirror early USDT’s scaling strategy. Paxos Gold’s market share has surged though, threatening to dethrone Tether in the tokenized gold market.a6:T434,Tether, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin USDT, is aggressively expanding into the tokenized gold market with a $150 million investment in Gold.com. This strategic acquisition grants Tether a 12% stake and a board seat, facilitating a partnership where Gold.com will lease Tether’s gold facilities and invest $20 million in Tether’s gold-backed token, XAU₮. This move mirrors the distribution-led strategy Tether used to dominate the stablecoin market, aiming to bridge physical and digital gold sectors while bolstering XAU₮’s credibility and scalability.

To solidify its position, Tether has made several significant investments in gold-related entities throughout 2025 and acquired 27 tons of physical gold in Q4 alone. CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that the firm aims to become one of the world's largest "gold central banks" amid weakening trust in fiat currencies. Despite these efforts, Tether faces intensifying competition from Paxos’s PAX Gold, which has captured a 42% market share compared to Tether’s 47% following recent market fluctuations.a7:T14df,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure Charles Hoskinson used a Feb. 6 livestream from Tokyo to push back on a familiar narrative he says he’s hearing on the ground in Japan: that Cardano is “fading” or “dead,” and that the bear market has drained the ecosystem’s momentum. Speaking midway through a multi-city tour tied to Cardano’s third cohort of ambassadors, Hoskinson said long-time community members and newcomers alike have been approaching him with relief that the project is still active. He framed the trip as a signal that Cardano, after years of protocol work, is shifting into what he called a commercialization phase, building products that feel less like infrastructure demos and more like mainstream use cases. Hoskinson Rallies Cardano Through The Downturn “We’ve been on tour all throughout Japan,” Hoskinson said, describing meetings with “a lot of investors, a lot of developers,” including people who have followed Cardano “for more than 10 years.” The message he said he’s delivering is that major building blocks are in place: “The infrastructure is strong. We’re fully decentralized. Governance has been done. So now it’s the time to go build some fun, exciting, real use cases and get them into the ecosystem.” Hoskinson name-checked Hydra , Cardano’s scaling effort, and pointed to projects he characterized as the “vanguard” of the next phase, including Midnight — the privacy-focused sidechain he has promoted as a cornerstone of Cardano’s broader roadmap. He also referenced “ Starstream ,” a WASM-based zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) designed for the Cardano blockchain to enable private, scalable smart contracts. The backdrop, he acknowledged, is a market environment that “is red, red, red,” with sentiment weak enough that some attendees told him they had assumed Cardano’s best days were behind it. Hoskinson’s response was less a price defense than a thesis about why crypto persists through cycles and why he believes the longer-term direction of global finance makes open networks unavoidable. “Globalism has finally reached its peak, accelerated by AI and accelerated by demographic changes,” he said. “The human race is starting to think in terms of we instead of nation by nation… And the old guard and the old way of doing things is fading. And they’re kicking and screaming as they’re being dragged off the stage.” Red Days https://t.co/lO21fGjc0w — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 5, 2026 He argued that a more integrated global economy ultimately needs a neutral settlement layer: an “economic franca,” in his words and that blockchain-based systems are the practical option. “The only way to run a world like this is through cryptocurrency. Full stop,” Hoskinson said. “Otherwise, you have to build an empire and no one’s strong enough to conquer the world right now… We need an economic franca. And you tell me how we’re going to do that without a blockchain.” The livestream veered into broader institutional mistrust, with Hoskinson citing political instability, corruption, and high-profile scandals as evidence that “deep down inside, we all know this can’t last.” He cast crypto as a mechanism to constrain human behavior through “rules” and “regulating functions,” rather than relying on institutional goodwill. But the most pointed moment came when he anticipated a common critique that his optimism is easy because he’s wealthy and responded with a personal financial claim and a commitment to keep building regardless of market outcomes: “Every now and then you hear something like this, you say, ‘Yes, but it’s easy for you to say, Charles, you’re rich. You can ride it out.’ I’ve lost more money than anyone listening to this. Over $3 billion now. It would have been real easy to cash out. Just walk away. And do you think I honestly care if I lose it all? Do you think I’m doing this for money? You’re pretty mistaken if you do.” Hoskinson also portrayed his distance from past industry blowups as a matter of personal discipline rather than luck. “There’s a reason I didn’t get rolled up in FTX ,” he said, adding that his “default answer is no” when it comes to the kinds of deals that later become liabilities. In closing, Hoskinson urged builders and community members to treat the drawdown as an endurance test rather than a verdict, tying Cardano’s ambassador programs, including a call to become a Midnight ambassador and engage via Intersect. His core message was simple: the market may get “more red” but he isn’t leaving. “I’m here for life,” Hoskinson said. “As long as I’m alive, I’m just going to keep going.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.2521.

Advertisement Bitcoin to Bottom After Strategy Sells Last Satoshi-Peter Schiff Leading gold bug and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff tweeted : Image Source: X Schiff believes that Strategy’s major purchases drove Bitcoin’s price up by more than 550%. He predicts that BTC’s bottom will come after Strategy is forced to sell its last Satoshi and all its artificial gains are wiped out. However, Schiff’s take is inaccurate as Saylor has continued to add more BTC to Strategy’s coffers every month. He actually accelerated the process in the last few months when the price took a beating, so he hasn’t stopped buying yet, let alone selling. A Test for Saylor’s “Diamond Hands” Schiff and other Bitcoin critics now have an opportunity to criticize Saylor’s BTC buying spree over the years. Some would suggest that next time, Saylor should capitalize on some short-term gains and put the interests of shareholders above his personal mission. However, it is highly unlikely that Strategy CEO is going to stop with his purchases, let alone capitulate and sell it in the open market.a9:Tcba,Bitwise says peak anxiety signals crypto market is nearing a bottom The crypto asset manager argued that while the current drawdown mirrors the anxiety of 2018 and 2022, long-term upside catalysts remain intact. Feb 6, 2026, 3:57 p.m. Bitwise contends that the crypto industry's obsession with timing a market bottom overlooks a historical pattern where peak investor anxiety often signals the start of a recovery. Having navigated the 2018 and 2022 winters, the crypto asset manager suggested the current "anxious feeling" in the market is a trailing indicator of historical recovery zones. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan noted that investors who bought the dip during the 2018 nadir saw returns of approximately 2,000%, while those who entered during the 2022 lows are up roughly 300% in just over three years. For those with a long-term horizon, the firm views the current disconnect between price and progress as a repeat of these specific cycles. The global crypto market has faced a bruising start to 2026, with over $2 trillion in value wiped out since the October 2025 peak. Bitcoin BTC $68 713,65 recently plummeted to a 16-month low near $60,000, a psychological breach that triggered nearly $5.4 billion in leveraged liquidations over a single 72-hour window. Analysts attributed the carnage to a perfect storm of macro headwinds: the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair signaling a hawkish hard money shift, massive outflows from U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) totaling billions, and a broader de-risking trend that has seen investors flee both digital assets and high-growth tech stocks. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $68,800 at publication time. According to the Friday blog post, the fundamental case for the asset class remains unchanged despite the price action. Hougan argued that the world is increasingly digital and demands non-fiat currencies, pointing to the ascendancy of stablecoins, the rise of tokenization, and the emergence of prediction markets and "AiFi" as evidence of a maturing ecosystem. He emphasized that while prices do not currently reflect this progress, Wall Street’s continued integration with blockchain technology suggests that fundamentals will eventually drive the next leg up. Regarding a potential turnaround, Bitwise acknowledged that crypto bear markets typically end in exhaustion rather than a sudden burst of excitement. However, the asset manager identified several specific triggers that could serve as a catalyst for a recovery. These include the potential passage of the CLARITY Act, a shift back toward risk-on market sentiment, rising interest rate-cut expectations, and technological breakthroughs at the intersection of AI and crypto. In the absence of a sudden positive shock, Bitwise expects the market to "grind out a bottom," prescribing a strategy of patience and a focus on the long-term destination.

Exchange says rapid account restrictions stabilized prices within five minutes. Bithumb denies hacking, claims no customer losses and normal operations restored. South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb has officially confirmed that an operational error led to an abnormal Bitcoin payout during a promotional event. The incident triggered a brief but sharp price dislocation on the platform before markets stabilized within minutes. Sponsored Sponsored Bithumb Confirms Accidental Bitcoin Payout In a statement, Bithumb apologized to users, acknowledging that “an abnormal amount of Bitcoin was paid to some customers” during the event, which caused temporary volatility as recipients sold the assets. “The Bitcoin price temporarily fluctuated sharply as some accounts that received the Bitcoin sold it,” the exchange said . According to Bithumb, its internal monitoring systems quickly detected the abnormal transactions. The platform responded by restricting trading activity on the affected accounts, which helped contain the disruption. “As a result, the market price returned to normal levels within 5 minutes, and the domino liquidation prevention system functioned normally, preventing chain liquidations due to the abnormal Bitcoin price,” the company stated. The clarification comes after Bitcoin briefly traded significantly below global market rates on Bithumb, fueling speculation about the cause of the sudden price drop.

Sponsored Sponsored “We want to make it clear that this incident is unrelated to any external hacking or security breach, and does not pose any issues with system security or customer asset management,” the exchange said. Impact on Bithumb Customer Funds The company also reassured users that customer funds remain safe and that core services are operating normally. “Customer assets are being safely managed as before, and transactions and deposits/withdrawals are currently operating normally,” the statement added. Importantly, Bithumb indicated that no customers suffered losses as a result of the incident, noting that it is continuing to review the situation and will disclose further details as necessary. “It is understood that this incident did not result in any loss or damage to customer assets. We will share all follow-up actions transparently and take full responsibility to ensure that not a single customer is harmed,” the exchange said. The episode highlights how operational errors, even when quickly resolved, can trigger sharp short-term price distortions in crypto markets, particularly on individual exchanges where liquidity conditions differ from global averages. Bithumb concluded its statement with another apology, saying it would strengthen safeguards and continue working to provide a stable trading environment. “Once again, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Key points: Bitcoin has never traded so far below its 200-day moving average, data shows. BTC price action is due “mean reversion” as a result. Analysis describes a “macro-driven” Bitcoin bear market now in progress. Bitcoin sees one of its fastest price drawdowns New analysis from Martin Leinweber, director of digital asset research and strategy at European index provider MarketVector Indexes, says that Bitcoin’s long-term investment thesis is “intact.” BTC price action has never strayed so far from its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) — and Leinweber thinks that the dip below $60,000 was anything but “normal.” “Bitcoin is -2.88σ below its 200-day moving average. In 10 years of data, this has literally NEVER happened before. Not during COVID. Not during FTX. Never,” he summarized in an X thread on Friday. The analysis places this week’s crash among Bitcoin’s 15 fastest, with BTC/USD dropping by more than 22% in a single week — a worse rate than in 98.9% of its history. “When you're in the 99th percentile of bad outcomes, mean reversion becomes highly probable,” Leinweber continued.

Agents can execute tasks across apps and build new capabilities when needed. Improvements are shared across the network, boosting overall agent performance. The race to move artificial intelligence from conversation to execution is accelerating. ai.com , a new consumer AI platform founded by crypto executive Kris Marszalek, is entering the market with autonomous AI agents designed to act on users’ behalf, not just answer prompts. The company says its agents can organize work, execute tasks across apps and even build missing tools themselves, a step that could push AI deeper into everyday digital life. From crypto scale to consumer AI ambition ai.com is led by Kris Marszalek , best known as co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com , one of the world’s largest consumer crypto platforms. Marszalek will continue to lead both companies, positioning ai.com as a mass-market AI play rather than a niche developer tool. The platform allows users to generate a personal AI agent in about 60 seconds, with no coding or technical setup. Unlike standard chatbots, these agents are designed to carry out actions like sending messages, managing calendars, automating workflows or building simple projects. ai.com says agents can even create new capabilities on their own if a task requires functionality that does not yet exist. Those improvements, once validated, are shared across the wider agent network. In theory, that creates a flywheel effect: the more agents are used, the more capable all agents become. Marszalek has framed this as a decentralized system that could speed progress toward artificial general intelligence, or AGI: AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks at a human-like level. “We are at a fundamental shift in AI’s evolution as we rapidly move beyond basic chats to AI agents actually getting things done for humans,” said Kris Marszalek, Founder and CEO of ai.com. Our vision is a decentralized network of billions of agents who self-improve and share these improvements with each other, vastly and rapidly expanding agentic capabilities and accelerating the advent of AGI. ai.com will officially launch its agent product on February 8, 2026, with a high-profile advertising debut during Super Bowl LX on NBC . Autonomy meets privacy and regulation While the promise is bold, autonomous agents raise immediate questions around safety, privacy and accountability. ai.com says each agent operates in a secure, isolated environment where user data is encrypted with individual keys and actions are limited strictly by user permissions. That architecture will be tested quickly if agents are allowed to trade stocks, handle payments or interact with third-party platforms. Financial regulators, in particular, are likely to scrutinize how responsibility is assigned when an AI agent makes a mistake or executes a harmful action. The company says users will retain full control, with all actions permission-based. Still, the real challenge will be proving that consumer-grade autonomy can scale without introducing new risks. ai.com is free to start, with paid subscription tiers offering more advanced capabilities. Additional features under exploration include financial integrations, agent marketplaces and social networks connecting humans, agents and agencies. For now, ai.com’s launch signals a shift in the consumer AI narrative, away from asking questions and toward getting things done.ae:Ta26,Ethereum price is trading inside a huge channel on the monthly chart. Bitcoin’s crash to $60,000 dragged ETH to its intraday lows. After falling to lows of $1,748, ETH risks another leg down. Ethereum’s price hovers above $1,960 as of writing on February 6, 2026. This follows a sharp downturn in the past 24 hours, with the top altcoin crashing to lows of $1,700 amid broader market turbulence. Bitcoin’s crash to $60,000, before rebounding to $67,000 , dragged ETH to its intraday lows. All the top altcoins, including Solana, BNB and XRP, fell sharply amid the bloodbath. Ethereum price recap Ethereum fell below $1,800 on Thursday, marking its weakest level since mid-2025 as heavy selling pressure intensified. The decline followed a sharp drop in Bitcoin to around $60,000, which sent shockwaves through the broader crypto market. Although prices have since recovered above $1,900, continued ETF outflows and a prevailing risk-off environment suggest bullish momentum remains fragile. Ethereum is down more than 29% over the past week and about 40% over the past month, underscoring the depth of the recent sell-off. ETH price prediction: could bears target $1,000 next? Although bulls are targeting a move back above $2,000, the monthly chart points to a fragile price structure. The chart paints a massive range with $4,900 forming the top established during the past bear cycle. At the lower end, the parallel channel suggests potential downside toward the $1,000–$1,200 zone. At present, the $1,800–$1,900 area aligns with support levels seen in April and May 2025, which were tested after ETH retraced from highs of around $4,100 in December 2024. This overlap reinforces the zone’s importance in determining near-term price direction. Ethereum price chart by TradingView Analysts see this as a critical support zone, but if sellers breach it, it could give way to a downturn to levels untested since Ethereum’s 2022 bear market bottom. As such, bulls must eye a notable bounce above $2,000. If this happens, the next targets lie in the $2,250-$2,700 range. However, a breakdown below $1,800 risks testing $1,700 again. This week’s breakdown aligns with a similar breakdown in March-April 2025, which put prices beneath a key uptrend line formed since the bullish flip in April 2020 after the COVID crash. With bears having touched the mark already amid current bearish conditions, the picture isn’t in favour of bulls. A revisit could open up a path to the multi-year demand reload zone around $1,250-$1,000. This area represents untapped liquidity from the 2022 lows.af:T80a,Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman argues that the current crypto crash differs from previous cycles due to a crisis of faith after the previous rally was driven mostly by politics. The "libertarian ideology" that historically supported Bitcoin’s floor doesn't apply now that the asset has become a "political creation." "It has bounced back several times from big declines because people had faith in it and because... there was a lot of ideology behind it. But this time looks different," Krugman said. HOT Stories "Fimbulwinter" Krugman claims that BTC may be facing its "Fimbulwinter", a reference to Norse mythology that describes the final winter before Ragnarok (the end of the world). He has argued that Bitcoin is not going to be an enduring asset after the leading cryptocurrency severely underperformed gold. "…the next gold turns out to be gold, not Bitcoin. I think it's a big wake-up for people that, you know, maybe this isn't actually going to be an enduring asset," Krugman said. You Might Also Like "In terms of the original idea that this was actually a superior form of money, it's a total bust, and it's a 17-year-old bust. That's the thing that gets to me. This is not an idea of the future. This is not a cutting-edge technology. This is something that is only slightly younger than the first iPhone." "If it hasn't made any inroads as an actual legitimate means of payment in 17 years, then clearly, it wasn't a great idea to start with," he said. A bottom signal? During the massive crypto crash, the industry’s most vocal and long-standing critics have re-emerged to read its last rites. In the span of just 48 hours, Krugman, Nouriel Roubini, and Mark Dow have all issued statements predicting the total collapse of the asset class. As reported by U.Today , Roubini recently went as far as predicting another crypto apocalypse. Some market observers now view this chorus of doom as a buy signal. Earlier today, Bitcoin crashed to $60,255, the lowest level since October 2024, but it then managed to pare these losses.b0:T45b,Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman argues that the current crypto crash is fundamentally different from previous downturns because the "libertarian ideology" and faith that historically supported Bitcoin have evaporated. He suggests that the asset has become a "political creation" and may be facing its "Fimbulwinter," a reference to the end of the world in Norse mythology, implying that Bitcoin will not be an enduring asset like gold. Krugman criticized Bitcoin as a "17-year-old bust" that has failed to establish itself as a legitimate form of payment, contrasting it with the longevity of gold and the innovation of the iPhone.

Despite the bleak outlook from prominent critics like Krugman and Nouriel Roubini, who are predicting a total collapse of the asset class, some market observers view this chorus of doom as a contrarian buy signal. Bitcoin recently crashed to $60,255, its lowest level since October 2024, before managing to recover some losses. The resurgence of long-standing critics issuing "last rites" for crypto has led some investors to believe the market could be nearing a bottom.b1:T148f,Fear & Greed Index plummets to 9, sparking intense volatility in crypto markets.

You remember the first time it ripped through a round number, $10k, $20k, $100k, you remember the mood shift when it stops rewarding optimism, you remember the quiet weeks when every bounce feels like a trap, and the loud ones when it feels like the floor has vanished. This cycle’s defining memory is going to be $126,000. That is the high I anchored on, the moment the tape stopped behaving like an uptrend and looked more like a distribution. I laid that case in October when I wrote that the bear market cycle had started at $126k , and the market has been doing what it often does after a cycle peak, it bleeds confidence first, then it bleeds price. As I write this, Bitcoin is down roughly 51% from that cycle high. On the chart, the current drawdown looks familiar enough to make you uncomfortable. I went back through the prior major cycles and pulled every roughly 50% drop from an all time high, then I looked at what happened next. The shape is never identical, the drivers change, the plumbing changes, the participants change, yet the human pattern repeats, denial, bargain bounces, then the moment people stop asking “is it over” and start asking “how low can it go.” In 2018, after Bitcoin was already down around 50% from the peak, it fell another roughly 70% before the true cycle bottom was in. In 2022, the next leg down after a 50% drawdown was smaller, closer to 50%. If you take that diminishing severity at face value, the next “after 50” leg this cycle could be closer to 30%, best case, and if it behaves more like the old regime, it could still be much worse. That range, another 30% to another 70% from here, is wide enough to be fairly useless on its own, but it does give us a direction. Bitcoin weekly price cycles: major tops and bear-market lows from 2017–2026. The whole point of writing about bear markets is to narrow the problem down into something human, something you can prepare for, something you can watch in real time without losing your mind. That is what this piece is for, to connect what I have written through this cycle with what the historical drawdown patterns show, then translate it into practical medium term levels and scenarios, with a clear set of signals that would force me to change my mind. The moment I stopped trusting the cycle, and why the chart still matters Before the $126k high, I spent a lot of time thinking about time. Bitcoin has a cycle clock, it is imperfect, it is often mocked, it is still one of the few frameworks that can keep you grounded when everything around you is noise. In September 2025 I wrote that the cycle clock pointed to a final high by late October, with the real question being whether ETFs would rewrite history. That piece was me trying to hold two truths at once, the cycle has rhythm, and the structure of this cycle is different. Less than three weeks later, I stopped dancing around it. I wrote that time was up maing the case that the top was in and the bear market cycle started at $126k . It was a line in the sand, because I have learned the hard way that peak markets do not feel like peaks, they feel like they are getting started. Now we have the benefit of data, and a chart that can be interrogated without ego. Using the weekly BTC chart, I marked the cycle tops using the peak week highs, then I tracked the drawdowns using the subsequent weekly lows. It is the same method for 2017 to 2018, 2021 to 2022, and 2025 to today. Historical Bitcoin cycles highlight a recurring first-leg drawdown of roughly 50%. Here is what that study says in plain language. In 2017, the peak week high was about $19.8k, the bottom week low was around $3.1k, an 84% peak to trough collapse. In 2021, the peak week high was about $69k, the bottom week low was around $15.5k, a 78% peak to trough collapse. In 2025, the peak week high was about $126.2k, and the lowest weekly low so far is around $60.1k, a 52% drawdown so far. While the chart can't tell you the future, it can tell you the regime you are in. A 52% drawdown from a cycle high is not a new state for Bitcoin, it is a familiar stage of the process. The uncomfortable part is what tends to happen next, because in the prior two cycles, “down 50” was closer to the middle than the end. That is why I keep coming back to levels and conditions, rather than trying to win the argument with a single number. The level map I gave you, and what it was trying to protect you from In November, once the cycle high was in the rear view mirror, I wrote a piece that was deliberately practical, Bitcoin to $73k , be prepared with the price levels to watch during a bear market. It was my attempt to translate a scary range into stepping stones. That map had a clear staircase. First, the market had to deal with $85k, the kind of level that sits in the collective memory as a line between “this is a correction” and “this is something else.” Then there was $73k, a level that matters because it is psychologically important and structurally important, it sits near a prior regime, it is where you would expect dip buyers to make a stand, and where you would expect sellers to test whether the bid is real. Below that, I highlighted $49.8k as the lowest significant shelf, the kind of number that starts showing up in long term charts as a magnet when the market is looking for a place to be wrong in public. A few days later I went further, and put my own name on a medium term bear thesis, that Bitcoin could fall to $49k , and that this winter could be the shortest yet. That piece was not just a price call, it was a framework with scenarios, a soft landing case, a base case, and a deep cut case, plus a set of flip levels that would tell us which path we were on. Then January arrived, and I explained how the month delivered concerning red flags, especially because the plumbing was already straining . That phrase, the plumbing, is where the objective part of the story sits. Price is the headline. Plumbing is the part that breaks you in a bear market, because it turns an orderly selloff into a cascade. It is the difference between a dip that feels like an opportunity and a dip that feels like a warning. So the medium term question becomes simple to ask, hard to answer, and very personal for anyone holding risk, does price catch down to the broken plumbing, or does the plumbing heal before we print the deeper levels? The drawdown patterns, and why I keep talking about diminishing declines When I compared prior drawdowns after Bitcoin had already fallen about 50% from a peak, I was not trying to create a magical formula. I was trying to quantify a feeling, that each cycle has had a different kind of pain. In the 2017 to 2018 bear market, once you were already down around 50% from the top, there was still a brutal amount of air below the market. In the 2021 to 2022 bear market, the additional decline after that midpoint was smaller, still nasty, still enough to hurt, yet less violent than the prior cycle. In the study I built from the data, the “additional after minus 50” decline was roughly 68% in the 2017 to 2018 cycle, and roughly 55% in the 2021 to 2022 cycle. So yes, it is reasonable to ask whether that additional leg shrinks again. If it shrinks again, you get a number that feels like a best case downside path from here, around another 30% lower from current levels. That is the logic behind the range, another 30% to another 70% from here, depending on whether history repeats softly or harshly. Bitcoin bear markets show diminishing downside after the first 50% drawdown. The problem is that “from here” is a moving target, and bear markets are rarely polite. They do not descend in a straight line. They punish conviction on both sides. They create rallies that feel like salvation, and dumps that arrive right after people are sure the worst is over. So I do not want to sell you a single forecast. Medium term targets make sense inside the historical envelope, and give you the conditions that would shift probability from one scenario to another. Medium term targets, three scenarios, and what would force a rethink Here is the cleanest way I can frame it, using the level map from my November pieces, the identified drawdowns, and the plumbing signals I flagged in January. CryptoSlate Daily Brief Daily signals, zero noise. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. 5-minute digest 100k+ readers Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. A medium-term downside ladder outlines soft landing, base case, and tail-risk scenarios from current price. Scenario 1, the soft landing, $56k to $60k This is the case where the market has already done most of the emotional work. It is down 50%, it has washed out late longs, it has scared weak hands, and now it transitions into a shorter winter. I sketched this as a “soft landing” band in the thesis because Bitcoin can absolutely bottom higher than the doomers expect when structural demand stays alive. What would make this scenario feel real is shift in the underlying signals. In that same thesis I laid out “flip levels” that matter more than vibes, ETF flow behavior, fee share in miner revenue, and hashprice stability. If you see sustained improvement there, the odds of a higher low increase, and the market spends less time looking for a dramatic bottom. Scenario 2, the base case, $49k This is still my primary medium term target, for one reason that matters in bear markets, it is the level that makes the most people feel sick, but it has extremely strong historical support. Way back in 2021-2022, the mid-$40ks was where institutional buying hit fever pitch and it was repeatedly defended. Bear market lows are social events. They are the point where narratives break. A $49k print would do that, especially for everyone who anchored their psychology to six figures. In my November level map, I called $49.8k the lowest significant shelf, in that piece, and then in the medium term thesis I made the case for $49k as the base scenario, and I kept tracking that path into January as the plumbing began flashing more warnings, in this update. This is also where the historical drawdown envelope stays honest. A move to $49k from a $126k high would still be a smaller overall decline than 2018 and 2022, it fits the diminishing severity theme, while still respecting the way Bitcoin tends to punish complacency. Scenario 3, the deep cut, $36k to $42k I included this range in the original thesis for a reason, it is the scenario you need to know exists, even if you do not want to live in it. A deep cut is what happens when the market reprices risk as well as confidence in the structure, and that can come from any combination of persistent outflows, miner stress, fee droughts, and macro shocks. In my thesis I framed this as a late 2026 into early 2027 risk, not as a near term certainty, and that timing matters, because deep bottoms tend to be a process, not a day. This is also the scenario that makes the historical analogy feel more like 2018, a long grind lower with one final capitulation that nobody believes until it arrives. Bitcoin’s weekly log chart mapping key support levels and medium-term downside targets across cycles. The $73k question, why it matters, and why it is not the finish line I want to return to $73k, because it is the level most people should emotionally latch onto. In that November piece I wrote about “Bitcoin to $73k ” because I wanted readers to have a plan for the first major battle. That battle is where dip buyers show up loudly, where influencers rediscover conviction, where bears take profit, and where the market decides whether it is dealing with an air pocket or a staircase. If Bitcoin retakes $73k and the plumbing improves at the same time, the market can stabilize higher than people expect. If Bitcoin fails to regain $73k and the plumbing continues to fray, then $56k to $60k starts to feel like the next serious destination, and $49k stops sounding dramatic and starts sounding mechanical. That is the real value of levels in a bear market, they help you turn panic into checklists. Historical cycles show a long gap between Bitcoin’s –50% drawdown and final trough. What would make me change my mind quickly I do not think readers need another list of scary numbers. They need to know what to watch so they can stay sane. The flips I care about are the same ones I laid out in the medium term thesis , and flagged again in the January update . If ETF flow behavior changes, if the market starts absorbing supply on red days, if the reflex to sell rallies weakens, that matters. If miner economics improve, if fee share becomes meaningfully supportive again, if hashprice stabilizes rather than printing new stress lows, that matters. If those things improve while price is still in the danger zone, then the probability weight shifts away from the deep cut and toward the soft landing. If those things do not improve, and price keeps breaking supports cleanly, then the base case becomes a magnet, and the deep cut remains a tail risk you keep on the table. That is the point of a framework, it forces you to be honest when the market changes. Closing, the human part of the bear market I have lived through enough Bitcoin cycles to know that the hardest part is the waiting, not the drop. It is the weeks where nothing happens, and you start imagining the worst, it is the weeks where something happens and you convince yourself it is over, it is the moment you realize your time horizon was shorter than you told yourself it was. Right now, we are in the part of the cycle where the market has already done enough damage to feel like a bear market, and not enough damage to satisfy history’s harshest versions of what comes next. That is why you see people arguing with such certainty, because uncertainty is exhausting. So here is my honest read, based on what I wrote at the time, what the historical drawdowns show, and what the plumbing has been signaling. Bitcoin’s drawdown trajectories show why the first 50% drop is rarely the end of the bear market. $73k is a battle, $56k to $60k is a test of whether this winter really is shorter, $49k is the base case shelf that would fit a diminishing decline cycle, and $36k to $42k is the deep cut scenario that only becomes likely if the internal stress stays broken for longer than most people are prepared for. I do not need to be right about the exact number to be useful, I need to be early enough to help you prepare, and flexible enough to admit when the market invalidates the framework. That is what I will keep doing, chart in one hand, plumbing gauges in the other, trying to stay objective while Bitcoin does what Bitcoin does.

American asset management firm BlackRock is cutting costs on its Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings by any means possible. According to recent on-chain data , BlackRock has sent a new tranche of BTC and ETH to Coinbase Prime, its preferred liquidity outlet. Bitcoin and Ethereum leading losses Since the start of the year, the broader crypto market has lost as much as $1.5 trillion. The digital currencies extended their sell-offs this week as Bitcoin dropped as low as $60,000 in the most brutal sell-off in the past year. BlackRock, the largest Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuer, remains caught up in this sell-off. Despite its role in boosting crypto sentiment, the firm has continued to sell. Per Lookonchain data, the firm has deposited 4,248 BTC worth $281 million and 5,734 ETH valued at around $11 million to Coinbase Prime. This is not the biggest sell-off recorded this month, as BlackRock initially sold $671 million in BTC earlier this week. Many in the industry have flagged the continuous sell-off from BlackRock as a major dampener on crypto sentiment. The argument is that if this sell-off does not stop, the trust of institutional investors may be lost. When will Bitcoin price bottom out? The general consensus on the crypto market is that a bear season is underway. Industry analysts have started projecting different scenarios that investors can expect moving forward. You Might Also Like Analysts like Peter Brandt have called a possible $58,000 bottom , a sign that more dumping is likely in the coming weeks or months. Arguing against the claims that a quantum threat is behind the BTC price crash, Capriole Fund Founder Charles Edwards has discounted these facts. He noted that the quantum threat is real, but it does not justify the Bitcoin price crash around its current range of $60,000. For now, no one can accurately predict where the BTC price will bottom out or when the bear market will end.b5:T7e9,Extreme capitulation metrics are now matching levels seen only at major cycle lows. Feb 6, 2026, 3:30 p.m. Bitcoin's BTC $65,998.81 Feb. 5 collapse will go down as one of the most historic selloffs on record. Below are the key statistics that help define the event and indicate how much further there may be to fall. The bitcoin price started the day near $73,000 and fell to a low around $62,000, a drop — or, as some market participants call it, a candle — of more than $10,000. The day's 14% decline was the largest single-day drop since November 2022, during the implosion of crypto exchange FTX. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The Fear and Greed Index dropped into single digits, a level seen only a handful of times in bitcoin’s 17-year history. At the same time, bitcoin was the third most oversold it has ever been on the RSI , an indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Supply in profit and loss The circulating supply in loss, meaning the number of coins that last moved at prices higher than the market price, surged to almost 10 million BTC. That is the fourth-highest level ever, comparable with the 2015, 2019 and 2022 bear-market bottoms. Total Supply in Loss (Glassnode) Another measure, the amount of long-term holders' circulating supply that is at a loss, reached 4.6 million BTC. At the lows of previous bear markets, the figure exceeded 5 million BTC, suggesting this metric is approaching, but has not yet fully matched, prior extremes. Total Supply in Loss by LTHs (Glassnode) Supply in profit and supply in loss have nearly converged, a condition that has historically aligned with the bottom of major market declines. At present, roughly 10 million BTC sit in profit and 10 million BTC sit in loss. While nobody knows for certain whether the bottom is in for bitcoin, history suggests it is likely close, especially with bitcoin already recovering toward $68,000. Still, market participants may be waiting for bitcoin to test its 200-week moving average, currently near $58,011.b6:Tb19,Is XRP's recovery sustainable or is this just a dead cat bounce? Ripple’s cross-border token nosedived to a 14-month low amid the recent crash of the broader cryptocurrency market. Despite the brutal collapse and the bearish conditions, one important indicator suggests that a short-term resurgence could be on the horizon. The Light at the End of the Tunnel The past 24 hours have been ruthless for the digital asset sector, and XRP undoubtedly felt the impact. Its valuation plummeted to $1.11 (per CoinGecko’s data), the lowest level since November 2024, while its market capitalization briefly shrank to nearly $70 billion. The violent move south has caused the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) to reenter territory last seen during the October 2025 collapse. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and ranges from 0 to 100. Ratios below 30 suggest that the valuation has declined too much in a short period of time, meaning the token is oversold and ready for a potential rebound. On the contrary, anything above 70 is considered a bearish zone. Hours ago, XRP’s RSI fell to 13, but later rose to the current 40. XRP RSI, Source: CryptoWaves Meanwhile, the asset’s price has regained some lost ground to nearly $1.40, raising the question of whether this marks the beginning of a genuine recovery or simply represents a dead-cat bounce. It is important to note that over the past few days, the spot XRP ETF netflows have been positive, suggesting that institutional investors remain interested in the asset. To put this into perspective, the same investment vehicles focused on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced massive red daily candles.

X user FEXIR | CRYPTO predicted that XRP may tumble below $0.50, while Charting Guy warned that the price could fall to $1. The increasing number of tokens stored on Binance reinforces fears of an additional crash. Data provided by CryptoQuant shows that investors have been transferring coins from self-custody to the biggest exchange in the past week, and now the reserves stand at almost 2.73 billion XRP.

Tags:b7:Tc7e,The price of XRP rose strongly on Friday after a sharp earlier decline, supported by increased buying activity and a technical rebound from oversold levels. XRP gained roughly 15%, recovering to around $1.30–$1.40, after falling nearly 20% earlier in the week to its lowest level since November 2024. The rebound came even as the broader cryptocurrency market remained under slight pressure. Oversold conditions trigger recovery Market data showed the token had entered deeply oversold territory during the recent sell-off, prompting bargain buying that helped drive the recovery. Trading volumes also increased sharply, indicating strong spot demand as investors stepped in following the decline. Such rebounds are common after rapid price drops, particularly when leveraged positions have already been cleared from the market. Liquidations and supply changes added to volatility Earlier losses were intensified by approximately $40 million in liquidations, which accelerated selling during periods of thin liquidity. Additional pressure came from the scheduled release of about 300 million XRP tokens from escrow by Ripple, temporarily increasing available supply. Mixed outlook for near-term prices Market participants remain divided over the near-term outlook. Some analysts said the rebound could mark the formation of a temporary price floor after the recent correction, while others warned that volatility may persist if broader crypto market sentiment remains weak. Maintaining levels above the $1.29 area could allow further gradual gains, while a renewed drop below that range could lead to another test of recent lows. Analyst EGRAG Crypto said his strategy is to stay positive on the asset if the price moves back above $1.85, which he believes could open the way for a rise toward $2.20. He added that a confirmed move above $2.50 would require a fresh reassessment of the overall market structure. On the downside, he said that if the price falls below $1.28, the position is small enough that he is comfortable continuing to hold it as part of his risk management approach.

Ad Disclosure Crypto is kicking off February 2026 with a distinct chill in the air. The tape is doing exactly what it always does during drawdowns: punishing leverage first, then forcing narratives to prove they have actual demand. At the time of writing, $BTC hovers around $66,805 and $ETH struggles near $1,895 , per CoinGecko, following a sharp multi-month retrace from late-2025 highs. ( coingecko.com ) But price is just the headline. The real signal is positioning. When the market de-risks this aggressively, liquidity fragments, spreads widen, and “beta” plays (memecoins, small caps) stop being forgiving. ETF flows tell a similar story. Data tracked by SoSoValue indicates U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recently endured a $1.33B net outflow week —the worst bleed since February 2025—even though flows managed a notable one-day rebound early this month. ( fastbull.com ) Meanwhile, mainstream coverage notes that the post-2025 euphoria has given way to deleveraging and renewed regulatory friction. It’s the classic cocktail that squeezes speculative excess out of the system. ( apnews.com ) Why does this matter for the “best crypto presales 2026” conversation? Because presales don’t exist in a vacuum. Gravity applies here too. However, capital tends to concentrate around two specific themes that survive risk-off regimes: infrastructure and distribution . If smart money is going to take early-stage risk right now, it wants a defensible thesis—scaling, settlement, and credible user demand. Which raises the uncomfortable question: where is crypto’s next useful throughput coming from—especially on Bitcoin? Bitcoin L2s Take Center Stage As Execution Moves Off L1 The most actionable presale theme in 2026 is simple: Bitcoin remains the settlement layer, but the actual work is moving elsewhere. Lightning continues to anchor the payments narrative. Capacity metrics hit records around 5,637 BTC in late 2025, suggesting that “Bitcoin as a medium of exchange” is compounding quietly even while price sentiment sours. ( bitcoinmagazine.com ) In the same vein, Stacks has pushed the “programmable Bitcoin” thesis forward via its Nakamoto upgrade milestones. ( stacks.co ) But here’s what most coverage misses: when markets draw down, builders don’t stop. They consolidate. Payments networks (Lightning) and execution environments (Bitcoin L2s) are currently fighting for the same prize— Bitcoin liquidity that actually does something . That’s where Bitcoin Hyper enters the fray. The project pitches itself as “THE FIRST EVER BITCOIN LAYER 2” with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration . The goal? Deliver extremely low-latency L2 processing and fast smart contract execution while relying on Bitcoin L1 for final settlement. The architecture is modular—Bitcoin settles, the SVM executes—with a decentralized canonical bridge for BTC transfers. (Yes, combining Bitcoin security with Solana speed is an ambitious play). The risk? Execution speed narratives can be intoxicating. Bridging design and sequencer assumptions—Bitcoin Hyper utilizes a single trusted sequencer with periodic L1 state anchoring —are where serious investors will focus their due diligence. Fast is easy to market; resilient is hard to ship. Review Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 thesis. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale Metrics: Big Raise, Clear Narrative In this environment, metrics speak louder than whitepapers. Presales that survive 2026 typically show sustained fundraising and a narrative that aligns with the market’s “infrastructure-first” bias. On the fundraising front, Bitcoin Hyper’s numbers aren’t small. According to the official presale page, the project has raised $31,257,822.88 , with tokens priced at $0.0136751 . In a market actively repricing risk, these figures suggest the bid isn’t purely momentum—there’s conviction behind the theme. We’re also seeing early “smart money” movement. Etherscan records show 2 whale wallets have accumulated $116K , with the largest single transaction of $63K occurring on Jan 15, 2026 . ( Etherscan ) While whale buys aren’t a guarantee of future performance, in a skittish tape, they often function as a sentiment catalyst. Utility-wise, Bitcoin Hyper is targeting: High-speed payments in wrapped BTC with negligible fees. DeFi primitives (swaps, lending, staking protocols). NFT and gaming dApps , supported by a developer SDK/API in Rust. On the incentive side, staking is advertised with high APY (rate not disclosed), featuring immediate staking after TGE and a 7-day vesting period for presale stakers , plus rewards tied to governance participation. For traders building a 2026 watchlist, here are the key questions: 1) Can the bridge model earn trust under stress? 2) Will developers actually deploy SVM apps, or will it remain theoretical? 3) Does Bitcoin liquidity migrate into on-chain apps as ETF flows stabilize? If the macro clouds part and Bitcoin’s ecosystem narrative rotates from “hold” to “use,” Bitcoin Hyper is positioned squarely in that slipstream. Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper site. This article is not financial advice; crypto is volatile, presales are high risk, and smart-contract/bridge designs can fail. Always do your own research. Key Takeaways $BTC (~$66,805) and $ETH (~$1,895) signal a risk-off market where leverage unwinds faster than narratives can rebuild. ETF flow whiplash (heavy outflows followed by rebounds) suggests institutional positioning is tactical, not a blind “up only” bet. Bitcoin scaling is fragmenting into payments (Lightning) and execution layers (L2s), putting “productive BTC” back in focus. Bitcoin Hyper targets this shift by bringing fast SVM execution to a Bitcoin-settled L2 environment.

Summary Cardano price dropped to a crucial support level as the crypto market crash continued. CME will launch its ADA futures on Monday next week. ADA’s price action will depend on the performance of the broad crypto market. Cardano ( ADA ) token was trading at $0.2650, down by 80% from its highest point in December 2024. It has also retreated by 91% from its all-time high of $3. A potential catalyst for ADA’s price will be the upcoming CME Group futures listing on February 9 this year. This is a major listing that will make it available to institutional and retail traders. Historically, such important launches normally lead to higher prices. For example, tokens such as Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) jumped after their futures launched. However, in Cardano’s case, there is a possibility that the rebound will not happen after the futures launch. First, the launch will occur during a crypto market crash . As such, the broader sentiment in the industry may outweigh the importance of the futures listing. Second, Cardano may remain under pressure since the ADA futures launch has been priced in by market participants. Additionally, Cardano has lost favor with investors in the past few years because it has been left behind by similar chains like Solana, BNB Chain, and Ethereum. Cardano has failed to attract major oracle networks like Chainlink. Its total value locked in the DeFi industry is less than $300 million, which is much lower than the billions in assets in the industry. Also, it has a small market share in the stablecoin industry, with just $30 million in assets. Charles Hoskinson and the team are working to address these issues through a 70 million ADA fund launched last year. The fund’s goal is to attract more oracles, tier-1 stablecoins, and analytics tools. Also, Cardano is preparing for the Midnight mainnet launch either this month or in March. Cardano price technical analysis ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the ADA token has been in a strong downtrend in the past few months. It retreated from a high of $1.3296 in December 2024 to a low of $0.2360. Its lowest level this week was notable as it has failed to move below it several times since December 2022. ADA price has moved below the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Averages, which have made a bearish crossover. The Relative Strength Index has moved into the oversold zone at 30. Therefore, the most likely Cardano price prediction is neutral. On the positive side, it has always bounced back whenever it reached this support level. This means that it may rebound again in the coming weeks. On the other hand, losing this support will lead to more downside, potentially to the key level at $0.100.ba:T859,Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has given a candid take on the recent crypto market crash and the wide-ranging ramifications of the current decline of the digital asset economy. Hoskinson stated that he has lost over $3 billion in value due to the ongoing price dump, but he still believes in the sector’s long-term outlook. Hoskinson gave these comments during a recent web interview in which he stated: “I’ve lost more money than anyone listening to this…., over $3 billion now, and it would have been real easy to cash out and walk away. Do you honestly think I care if I lose it all? Do you think I am doing this for money? You’re pretty mistaken if you do. There is a reason why I am not in the Epstein Files…” Hoskinson maintained his eccentric take and tried to relate his omission from the Epstein Files to his integrity. He continued, stating that the crypto community should persevere in the face of such major hardship. He predicted that the alternative would be detrimental to everyone, as the legacy system that overcharges and censors them would not hesitate to fire them once AI takes over. While this is quite a zero-sum prediction from the ADA proponent, Hoskinson’s experience is extensive because he is also one of the eight co-founders of Ethereum, along with Vitalik Buterin. He has been involved in the crypto scene since 2013-14 and understands what the latest losses mean for the larger digital asset market. Advertisement Cardano Extends Losses His flagship ADA cryptocurrency is trading around $0.26 at press time, down from its All-Time High (ATH) of $3.1 set back in November 2021. Cardano, like the rest of the digital asset market, had a 2025 to forget, failing to become the catalyst for a new altcoin boom. The last 3 months were particularly brutal as it lost roughly 55% of its value. Here is the ADA/USD graph during this time: Image Source: TradingView ADA, along with the rest of the layer-1 blockchains, is in a complete free fall right now, but it did find some strong support below the $0.25 level earlier today. All in all, the cryptocurrency is roughly 91.6% down from its ATH.bb:T8b5,Bitcoin rises past $68,000, extending bounce from Thursday's crash Strategy, MARA Holdings and Galaxy Digital are among crypto-related stocks posting double-digit percentage gains early Friday. Feb 6, 2026, 3:18 p.m. Crypto markets are adding to overnight gains in U.S. morning trade on Friday, with bitcoin BTC $65,998.81 climbing above $68,000, up about 13% since hitting $60,000 late yesterday. Even with the bounce, bitcoin remains down 2% over the past 24 hours. Ether ETH $1,926.58 is lower by 3% and solana SOL $81.57 by 5%. Outperforming is XRP XRP $1.3696 , which has climbed to $1.47, now higher by 8% over the last day. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Crypto-related stocks are seeing major upside moves Friday after plunging in the previous session. Strategy (MSTR) — which reported a $14.2 billion fourth-quarter loss late Thursdy — is higher by 14%, though at $122, still lower by 22% year-to-date. Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is up 15% and bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) is up 12%. Underperforming on Friday is bitcoin miner-turned AI infrastructure provider IREN (IREN), down 1.8% after disappointing earnings results Thursday night. Saylor gets serious about Quantum Those looking for bottom signals are pointing to last night's Strategy earnings call in which Michael Saylor pledged a commitment to leading a Bitcoin security program that will address the quantum threat. Some in crypto have argued that bitcoin's security model faces a serious threat from quantum computing — a threat so imminent that many investors are either selling or refusing to allocate to bitcoin at all. "Saylor’s announcement tells me prices have finally gotten the Bitcoin community to acknowledge and address quantum risk," wrote Quinn Thompson . Poised for technical bounce Paul Howard, director at crypto trading firm Wincent, noted that bitcoin is now back at price levels last seen 14 months ago — a technical setup that often invites at least a short-term bounce. "It would be odd if we did not see at least some short term reversion here," he said, especially with RSI flashing oversold conditions. He added that trading volumes in BTC and ETH have surged to their highest in over two years — more than double 2024–25 levelsbc:T16d0,Mahe, Seychelles — BitMart has expanded the availability of its crypto-linked payment card, BitMart Card , to more than 115 countries and regions worldwide , marking a new phase in the platform’s payment ecosystem strategy. Alongside the geographic expansion, the company unveiled its 2026 reward structure, offering cashback rates of up to 5.5% and annual cumulative benefits exceeding $300 . The move reflects the increasing integration of digital assets into day-to-day financial activity beyond exchange trading environments. Everyday Spending Trends Support International Growth Unlike some crypto payment products that rely on short-term promotions or remain limited to specific regions, BitMart Card’s global footprint has been built through sustained, real-world consumer demand. The card is now widely used across a range of everyday spending scenarios, including dining, online shopping, high-frequency daily expenses, and cross-border payments. BitMart noted that the formation of stable usage patterns across multiple markets highlights increasing acceptance of crypto payments globally, as users seek practical, reliable ways to spend digital assets beyond trading environments. Crypto Payments Transition Toward Functional Utility In the early stages of crypto payment adoption, many products were largely experimental, with limited use cases and frequency. As infrastructure has matured, crypto payment tools are increasingly evolving toward everyday financial utilities. The usage trajectory of BitMart Card reflects this shift. Crypto assets are no longer confined to on-platform balances, but are increasingly being used directly for real-world consumption. Whether for seamless payments during international travel or instant settlement in daily transactions, demand for stable, long-term crypto payment solutions is being met through BitMart Card. Updated 2026 Rewards Emphasize Continued Engagement As both user adoption and usage frequency continue to grow, BitMart has introduced a 2026 upgraded benefits structure for BitMart Card, designed to emphasize long-term value rather than short-term incentives. According to the company, key highlights of the updated benefits framework include: Up to 5.5% cashback across a wide range of everyday spending categories More than $300 in annual cumulative rewards , combining welcome benefits and ongoing usage incentives for both new and existing users Additional benefits such as free ATM withdrawal allowances , tiered cashback structures, and long-term reward programs integrated with the BitMart ecosystem, aligning payment activity with broader asset participation A BitMart spokesperson said the upgrade reflects a systematic optimization based on long-term user behavior, aimed at supporting the normalization of crypto payments in everyday consumption through sustainable incentives. External Reviews Reinforce Competitive Standing Amid intensifying competition in the crypto payments sector, BitMart Card has also received independent third-party recognition. The card recently ranked among the top global crypto cards evaluated by CryptoCardHub , an industry review platform that assessed 86 crypto card products worldwide. The recognition reflects the card’s practical usability, accessibility, and overall value proposition in real-world payment scenarios. According to CryptoCardHub’s assessment, BitMart Card’s performance is driven by its focus on everyday spending convenience, automatic crypto-to-fiat conversion at the point of payment, and its integration with Visa’s global merchant network. This recognition underscores BitMart’s continued efforts to advance the mainstream adoption of digital assets through functional payment infrastructure. Payment Infrastructure Gains Strategic Importance As crypto trading infrastructure becomes increasingly standardized, industry competition is shifting toward real-world application and payment usability. Market observers widely view the ability to deliver consistent, reliable payment experiences across regions as a key differentiator in the next phase of platform competition. BitMart emphasized that expanding BitMart Card to 115+ countries and regions represents a critical step in integrating crypto assets into the real economy. The company said this foundation not only strengthens its position in crypto payments but also supports future expansion into broader payment scenarios and financial services.

According to Whale Alert , a fresh $1,000,000,000 USDT mint has entered the crypto market today, landing just as XRP and Shiba Inu (SHIB) attempt rebounds from their deepest 2026 sell-offs. The situation is different for these popular cryptocurrencies, though. One one side, XRP is reacting after collapsing through multimonth support at $1.30. On the other, SHIB is fighting to escape extreme downside zones last seen during prior market stress cycles. Whether this $1 billion capital injection becomes defensive fuel, speculative firepower or a simple balance sheet for exchanges like Binance or Coinbase will shape how altcoins like SHIB and XRP behave in the weekend ahead. XRP and Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocket amid "dead cat bounce" After the dust of the $2.6 billion liquidation tsunami settled, XRP has exploded nearly 18% off its capitulation lows near $1.22, bouncing hard from a 26% breakdown that nearly triggered panic across long-term holders. XRP is still down over 40% from its December peak and remains locked below critical resistance zones near $1.60. HOT Stories The price action looks reactive but not yet conviction-driven, and comes just days after XRP printed its lowest level since October 2025 . Source: CoinMarketCap In the meantime, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is grinding back to the $0.0000068 resistance after briefly spiking below $0.00000507, a level not seen since the Terra collapse in 2023. The 7.8% bounce today might look like relief, but structurally, SHIB remains in a brutal downtrend. The meme coin is still trading 86% below its local top and faces layered supply walls near $0.000009 and $0.00001102. You Might Also Like The timing of the $1 billion USDT mint raises key questions. Is this new liquidity designed to stabilize plunging altcoins? Or is it dry powder for exchange reserves amid cascading liquidations? For now, all eyes remain on XRP’s ability to reclaim $1.6 and SHIB’s fight to break out of its liquidity trap. If this $1 billion hits exchanges in full force, the next move could be decisive — up or down.

Evidence includes IBIT's record $10.7 billion trading volume with only $175 million in net outflows, relatively low liquidations on crypto exchanges, and unusual price correlation between Bitcoin and Solana. IBIT has become the top venue for BTC options trading, and some hedge funds hold substantial portions of their assets in this ETF.

XRP has demonstrated remarkable resilience with a buying volume surge approaching $500 million, occurring as the asset reached extremely oversold conditions. The increased liquidity suggests potential for relief rallies, though investors should remain cautious as strong volume spikes can be short-term speculative reactions. Shiba Inu has shown unexpected strength during this downturn, though this is more likely due to reduced liquidity in SHIB markets rather than fundamental bullish reversal. Bitcoin faces a critical moment as it tests key support levels, with momentum indicators suggesting deep oversold conditions that historically precede relief rallies. However, the broader trend remains bearish, and Bitcoin could potentially decline toward the psychological $50,000 mark if selling pressure persists.","aiSummaryThai":"ตลาดคริปโตกำลังประสบกับภาวะทรุดตัวอย่างรุนแรง แม้ว่าจะมีการแสดงอาการฟื้นตัวบางอย่างในสกุลเงินดิจิทัลบางประเภท ไออาร์พี (XRP)ได้แสดงความคงตัวที่น่าประทับใจด้วยปริมาณการซื้อเพิ่มขึ้นอย่างรวดเร็วถึง 500 ล้านดอลลาร์สหรัฐ เมื่อสกุลเงินนี้ถึงราคาในเขตขาดทุนอย่างรุนแรง การเพิ่มขึ้นของสิทธิคล่องส่งผลให้มีแนวโน้มสำหรับการฟื้นตัวชั่วคราว แต่นักลงทุนควรระมัดระวังเนื่องจากการกระทำที่มีปริมาณการซื้อสูงอาจเป็นปฏิกิริยาเชิงพยากรณ์ระยะสั้นได้ ชิบะอินุ (SHIB) ได้แสดงความแข็งแกร่งที่ไม่คาดคิดในระหว่างการลดลงของตลาด แต่ความคงตัวนี้เกิดจากปัจจัยด้านสิทธิคล่องน้อยลงในตลาด SHIB มากกว่าพื้นฐานที่แท้จริง บิทคอยน์ (BTC) อยู่ในจุดวิกฤติเนื่องจากการขายลดลงล่าสุด แม้ว่าตัวชี้วัดโมเมนตัมจะบ่งบอกว่าบิทคอยน์อยู่ในเขตขาดทุนอย่างหนักซึ่งมักนำไปสู่การฟื้นตัว แต่แนวโน้มโดยรวมยังคงเป็นแนวขาลง หากกดดันด้านการขายยังคงอยู่ บิทคอยน์อาจมุ่งหน้าสู่จุดยอดทางจิตวิทยาราคา 50,000 ดอลลาร์","author":"Arman Shirinyan","categories":["bitcoin","altcoins"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Market is being actively pushed down, and there is a strong possibility that things will normalize on the weekend.","createdAt":"2026-02-07T00:15:14.544Z","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/100170.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-07T00:15:14.397Z","fullContent":"$1c","keyPoints":["XRP shows potential recovery with $500M buying volume while being extremely oversold","Shiba Inu's strength appears more due to reduced liquidity than fundamental factors","Bitcoin faces critical support levels with oversold conditions but potential to drop to $50,000 if bearish trend continues"],"link":"https://u.today/crypto-market-review-500000000-in-xrp-buying-volume-shiba-inu-shib-surprisingly-bullish-will","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:01:00.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"neutral","slug":"crypto-market-review-500000000-in-xrp-buying-volume-shiba-inu-shib-surprisingly-","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"Crypto Market Review: $500,000,000 in XRP Buying Volume, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Surprisingly Bullish, Will Bitcoin (BTC) Be Saved Before $50,000?","translateRetries":0,"translatedContent":"ตลาดกำลังถูกกดราคาอย่างแข็งขัน และมีโอกาสสูงที่สถานะการณ์จะกลับเป็นปกติในสุดสัปดาห์นี้","translatedTitle":"รีวิวตลาดคริปโต: ปริมาณการซื้อ XRP ครั้งใหญ่ 500 ล้านดอลลาร์, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ทำกำไรได้น่าตื่นเต้น, Bitcoin (BTC) จะหลบหลีกจากการตกลงถึง 50,000 หรือไม่?","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T05:35:16.333Z","wordCount":915},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c3a","guid":"https://bitcoinist.com/tether-bets-big-on-gold-with-150-million-investment-in-gold-com/","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Stablecoin giant Tether has made a significant $150 million investment in Gold.com, acquiring approximately 12% of shares at a discounted price.

Analysts attribute the crash to weak US jobs data and broader market skittishness rather than issues within the crypto industry like exchange collapses.
