4:T7f3,Zoe Gralinska-Sakai has joined XTB online investing as
Head of Regional Marketing for the UK, France and Italy, according to an update
on her LinkedIn profile. She is based in Warsaw, where the Polish-founded
brokerage is growing its international footprint.
Joining XTB amid Expanding European Footprint
She joins the broker amid an ongoing expansion push, with XTB expecting to serve more than 2 million users globally through its multi-asset
investment app.
"Turning the page! Excited to share I've joined XTB
online investing as Head of Regional Marketing for the UK, France and Italy," she mentioned. "Focused on growth, strengthening local relevance, and
delivering a mission of enabling financial freedom by making investing more
accessible."
Gralinska-Sakai moves to XTB after more than three
years at Revolut, where she held several senior marketing roles in Poland and
remotely. Most recently, she served as Global Brand Marketing Manager,
following a previous position as Creative Marketing Manager focused on regional
growth in Central and Eastern Europe.

Ad Spend Soars and Margins Tighten
The latest appointment comes as XTB rapidly scales its marketing activity, with 2025 spending on promotion and branding surging by PLN
240.2 million year‑on‑year to PLN 585 million. It comes as the group roll out broad
multi‑market campaigns and sponsorships, including its largest‑ever global
branding push in the second half. 
The push delivered a sharp expansion in the client
base, with total clients jumping to 2,164,867 in 2025 from 1,361,564 a year
earlier, supported by 864,286 new client additions, a 73% increase versus 2024.

However, the marketing‑led expansion has weighed on
profitability, contributing to a 24% drop in net profit to PLN 643.8 million
and a 15% decline in EBIT to PLN 834.3 million in 2025, even as total operating
income rose 15% to PLN 2,146.8 million.

publicly traded retail trading platforms heavily reliant on cryptocurrency
trading revenue saw their stock prices continue a sharp descent today (Thursday),
with Robinhood and eToro each extending multi-session losing streaks as Bitcoin
crashed to its lowest level since October 2024.
HOOD closed
at $75.67 on Thursday, marking its eighth consecutive day of losses and
representing a decline of nearly 10% for the session. The stock hit its lowest
level since June 2025, with the extended selloff erasing gains accumulated
during the late-2025 crypto market rally.
ETOR fared
similarly, dropping approximately 7% Thursday to close just below $26.54 in its
seventh straight losing session. The Israeli-founded trading platform, which
debuted on Nasdaq in May 2025 at $69, has now shed more than 60% of its value
since its public market launch.
Bitcoin Plunges in
Sharpest Single-Day Drop in Over a Year
The stock
declines tracked Bitcoin's dramatic collapse Thursday, with the cryptocurrency
falling to $63,500 during the session, marking its lowest point since October
2024. The selloff accelerated throughout the day, with Bitcoin ultimately
dropping more than 13% in one of its sharpest single-day percentage declines in
at least 15 months.
The broader
crypto market capitalization fell 6.4% in 24 hours to $2.49 trillion, with 92
of the top 100 digital assets posting losses. Bitcoin has now dropped 44% from
its October peak, erasing more than $800 billion in market value.
The selloff
extended to Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, which fell more
than 13% Thursday to close around $152.44, testing levels not seen since April
2025. Coinbase marked its eighth consecutive session in the red, directly
tracking the cryptocurrency market's steep decline.
Revenue Concentration
Creates Vulnerability
The three
platforms share a common weakness: substantial dependence on cryptocurrency
trading for revenue generation. eToro's crypto
reliance proved particularly acute in recent quarters, with digital assets contributing 91% of total
revenue in Q2 2025 when crypto markets surged. 
For the
full year 2024, cryptoassets accounted for almost 40% of eToro's $931 million
in commission revenue, though the company's crypto dependency fluctuates
dramatically with market conditions.
"For
many investors, shares of companies like eToro and Robinhood are indirect
exposure to cryptocurrencies on the stock market, and the strong dependence of
their financial results on the fate of cryptocurrencies means that we are
witnessing situations like this,” Arkadiusz Jóźwiak, analyst and crypto
educator from Comparic.pl, explained to FinanceMagnates.com. 
Robinhood
showed somewhat more diversification but still faces significant crypto
exposure. Cryptocurrency revenue reached $268 million in Q3 2025, representing
approximately 20% of the company's $1.27 billion total revenue, with a 339%
year-over-year increase. 
The platform's
chief investment officer recently warned that retail net buying activity has
slowed following a late October surge, raising concerns about sustained trading
volumes.
Bull Market Boom Now
Reversing
Both
platforms experienced explosive crypto revenue growth during 2024's digital
asset rally. eToro's commission revenue jumped 48% year-over-year in 2024, with
over 25% of that growth concentrated in Q4 alone as Bitcoin surged. Net profit
skyrocketed to $192 million from just $15.3 million in 2023, driven primarily
by crypto trading activity.
Robinhood's
Q4 2024 cryptocurrency revenue of $358 million represented a 700%
year-over-year increase, surpassing options trading revenue for the first time
in company history. For full-year 2024, Robinhood generated $2.95 billion in
total revenue, up 58%, with crypto contributing 21%.
“When
Bitcoin rises, everyone is happy and company shares also rise, but when it
falls, sentiment automatically changes. It is not certain that if Bitcoin
continues to fall, Robinhood and eToro will not follow it further down,”
Jóźwiak added.

Markets and MarketAxess posted record-breaking volumes in January, reflecting
heightened institutional activity across rates and credit markets.
Tradeweb
reported total trading volume of $65.5 trillion for the month, with average
daily volume reaching $3.1 trillion, up 26.2% year-over-year. Meanwhile,
MarketAxess logged record average daily volume of $18.6 billion in total
credit, a 28% jump from January 2025. The company's rates business grew 19%
year-over-year, bringing total platform ADV to $47.7 billion, up 23%.
"In
January, we delivered 28% growth year-over-year in total credit on record ADV
of $18.6 billion, and 19% growth in total rates," said Chris Concannon,
CEO of MarketAxess. "In credit, our emerging markets ADV increased 50% to
a record $5.5 billion, almost 30% above the previous monthly record set last
year."
Credit Markets Lead Growth
Both
platforms saw particularly strong growth in credit markets. Tradeweb's fully
electronic U.S. credit ADV rose 24.4% year-over-year to $9.4 billion, while
European credit jumped 44% to $3.5 billion. The company captured 17.5% market
share of fully electronic U.S. high-grade TRACE and 7.1% of high-yield TRACE.
MarketAxess
posted U.S. high-grade ADV of $8.4 billion, up 20% from the prior year. The
company's emerging markets business stood out, with ADV climbing 50% to $5.5
billion, nearly 30% above the previous monthly record. Hard currency volumes
rose 28% while local markets surged 94%. BlackRock and
MarketAxess have deepened their collaboration to optimize global credit markets, which
may be contributing to the strong institutional flows.
Rates Trading Surges on
Policy Uncertainty
Government
trading picked up momentum as political tensions and shifting inflation
expectations drove positioning. Tradeweb's U.S. government ADV increased 15.3%
to $267.7 billion, while European government volumes surged 36% to $79.4
billion.
Interest
rate derivatives showed the sharpest gains on Tradeweb's platform. Swaps and
swaptions with maturities of one year or longer climbed 34.6% to $591 billion
in daily volume, while total rates derivatives ADV surged 51.1% to $1.2
trillion.
Tradeweb's
mortgage trading hit an all-time high, with ADV up 16.7% to $310.1
billion. Tradeweb's
year-end trading volume hit $63 trillion in December, showing the momentum has carried
into the new year.
New Protocols Gain Ground
MarketAxess
highlighted growth in newer execution methods. Block trading ADV jumped 56%
year-over-year, with U.S. credit block volumes up 35% and emerging markets
block trading doubling to $2.5 billion. Portfolio trading volumes more than
doubled, rising 126% to $2 billion in daily volume.
Dealer-initiated
activity increased 13% to $1.8 billion, with Mid-X trading volume hitting a
record $6.9 billion, up 383%. Tradeweb reported record European credit volumes
driven by increased adoption of its Automated Intelligent Execution tool.
Meanwhile, institutional
FX volumes eased in December after a three-month rally, but the fixed-income platforms showed
no signs of cooling as 2026 began. The January results suggest electronic
trading continues to capture share from traditional voice-based execution,
particularly in credit and emerging market products.

million Bitcoin transaction over the Lightning Network in a pilot settlement
with cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, marking what the firms say is the largest
publicly reported Lightning payment to date. 
The transaction, executed on Jan. 28 and valued at $1
million at the time, reportedly settled nearly instantly and with minimal fees.
According to the official announcement, it was facilitated using enterprise Lightning
infrastructure from Voltage, a Bitcoin payments and infrastructure provider
focused on institutional clients. 

Lightning is often viewed as experimental. It’s time to see it in production.We successfully sent $1,000,000 over the network.Here’s what that execution looked like.Big thanks to @krakenfx & @voltage_cloud pic.twitter.com/MoeBMDeRHV
— Secure Digital Markets (@SD_Markets) February 5, 2026
Pointing to Faster Settlement for Institutions
“We have moved past the era of questioning Bitcoin's
institutional capacity. Now, the only remaining variable is how quickly lagging
institutions will abandon legacy systems,” said Mostafa Al-Mashita, Co-Founder
and Director of Sales & Trading at SDM.
While the network has been widely used for small consumer
payments, its suitability for large institutional settlements has remained an
open question.
Traditional Bitcoin transactions can take minutes or
longer to confirm and are subject to fluctuating fees, factors that complicate
treasury operations and inter-institution settlements. 
SDM said the pilot demonstrated that Lightning could
support use cases such as internal treasury movements, large-value settlements,
and transfers between trading venues without the delays associated with
on-chain settlement.

Kraken, one of the longest-operating crypto exchanges,
has supported Lightning for retail payments for several years. The firm said
the transaction reflects growing demand from institutional clients for faster
settlement options.
Cutting Reliance on Legacy Payment Rails
The transaction relied on Voltage’s managed Lightning
infrastructure, which provides liquidity management, node uptime, and
operational guarantees designed to meet institutional requirements.

This article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.8:Tf6b,A new venture called Lumina Markets has begun advertising for marketing and legal staff ahead of a planned launch of a prediction-markets platform. The job listings, which appeared on LinkedIn last week, describe the firm as being “backed by a billionaire pioneer of electronic trading”.  According to Business Insider, they were posted by an employee of Interactive Brokers, the brokerage founded by Thomas Peterffy.
Corporate filings appear to add further colour. Registration documents reviewed by Business Insider show that Lumina Markets was incorporated by an in-house lawyer at Interactive Brokers, while its CEO is another attorney who has worked closely with both the firm and Peterffy. Neither Interactive Brokers nor Peterffy has publicly confirmed any involvement.
Still, the overlap is suggestive rather than coincidental.
Not Their First Outing 
If Lumina does turn out to be linked to Interactive Brokers, it would not mark the broker’s first venture into prediction markets. In 2024, it launched ForecastEx, a platform allowing users to trade yes-or-no contracts tied to economic data, political outcomes, climate events and other real-world developments. 
At the time, management was careful to draw limits. During earnings calls in Q3 2025, Peterffy stressed that the firm had no intention of entering sports-related contracts, which faced regulatory headwinds.  
That position, however, has since softened: sports events are now among the contracts available on ForecastEx.
What remains unclear is how Lumina Markets would distinguish itself from its apparent sibling. 
The Regulatory Winds Shift 
Prediction markets occupy an awkward space in America’s legal architecture. They are overseen not by gambling regulators but by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which classifies such platforms as designated contract markets. 
The distinction is interesting, to say the least.  
In traditional sports betting, people bet against a bookmaker, which sets odds and pockets losses. In prediction markets, participants trade contracts with one another, while the platform takes a fee for matching buyers and sellers. 
On paper, at least, this makes them financial exchanges rather than gambling operators.
That distinction is being tested. Kalshi, the sector’s largest player, has faced lawsuits from several states, including Massachusetts and Nevada, arguing that its sports-related contracts amount to illegal gambling, lacking age restrictions and other safeguards required by gaming laws. 
Kalshi counters that it offers financial instruments, not bets.
The regulatory winds, though, appear to be shifting in the industry’s favour. In 2026, the new head of the CFTC, Michael Selig, reportedly instructed the agency to withdraw a proposed 2024 rule that would have barred trading on sports and political outcomes. He also moved to rescind a 2025 advisory urging caution over sports contracts. 
Everyone Wants a Slice 
The industry is expanding at breakneck speed. Industry estimates suggest trading volumes on prediction market platforms rose from roughly US$9 billion in 2024 to around US$40 billion in 2025. Some forecasts now place annual volumes near US$1 trillion by the end of the decade.
Prediction markets have even seeped into popular culture: At the 2026 Grammy Awards, the host Trevor Noah joked that anyone who had bet on him saying “potato” on Polymarket would have won big.

What is happening???? pic.twitter.com/xMxwrueqTD
— Polymarket (@Polymarket) February 2, 2026
Established brokers have taken note. Robinhood launched a prediction-markets hub in March 2025; by year’s end, it had become one of the app’s fastest-growing products, generating around US$100 million in annualised revenue. Plus500 followed suit in 2026. 
With the 2026 FIFA World Cup just around the corner, interest is unlikely to fade. 


This article was written by Adonis Adoni at www.financemagnates.com.9:T856,Gemini is partnering with eToro to support customers in the
United Kingdom, European Union, and Australia as it prepares to close its
services in these regions.
Last year, eToro’s European subsidiary, eToro Europe Ltd, received
an approval from the Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission. The approval
allows the platform to operate under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets
Regulation and ensures compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive. 
Gemini Shuts UK, EU, Australia Accounts
Effective 6 April 2026, Gemini will shut all customer
accounts in the UK, European Economic Area, and Australia. The closure will
take place in stages. During the initial phase, existing customers can continue
using their accounts, but new account creation and incentive programs will be
disabled.
Starting 5 March 2026, all affected accounts will enter
withdrawal-only mode. Customers will no longer be able to sell crypto assets.
Gemini advises that all remaining crypto and fiat balances be withdrawn before
6 April 2026.
Gemini Guides Clients Ahead eToro Transition
Gemini has issued guidance to customers ahead of the
wind-down. It recommends refraining from new fiat or crypto deposits, unstaking
any staked assets, selling crypto for fiat if needed, and cancelling recurring
orders.
To ease the transition, Gemini has partnered with eToro. The
company stated, “We have partnered with eToro to ensure a smooth transition and
special signup bonuses for Gemini clients in the UK, EU, and Australia
transitioning to the eToro exchange.”
eToro Offers Multi-Asset Platform Access
Gemini clarified that customers are free to move assets to
any platform of their choice and encouraged users to conduct their own
research. The company noted it is not responsible or liable for assets once
they leave the exchange.
eToro operates a multi-asset platform that includes more
than 150 cryptocurrencies, equities from over 20 global stock exchanges, and
over 100 curated Smart Portfolios. Users can also copy trades of more than
4,000 investors on the platform.

Officer for Portugal at Trade Nation, according to an update on
his LinkedIn profile. He will be based in Lisbon, where the broker is building a
dedicated local presence.
Last year, Trade Nation established a new entity in the region, announcing recruitment for several key positions to support
the operation. The advertised roles were largely compliance-focused,
including a Head of Compliance, Risk Manager, and System Administrator.
Trade Nation Strengthens EU Presence
Before joining Trade Nation, dos Santos was Sales Director, LATAM at Finalto, based in London. He previously served as Global Business Development Head at Markets.com and Head of Partnerships at Vida Markets. Earlier in his career, he was UK Head of Client Services & On-Boarding at Trading 212 and also held roles at IG Group.
Trade Nation has been strengthening its leadership in the recent past through several high-profile appointments. Philippe Capelle joined as
Chief Marketing Officer. 
Other hires include Kypros Zoumidou, who joined as Managing
Director, and Chief Executive Officer Jon Noble, both of whom previously held
senior roles at the London-listed broker IG. Commenting on the hires, Noble mentioned that “we have some ambitious strategic plans to develop Trade Nation, and having Kyp on board will really help us move the business to the next level.”
Trade Nation Swings Back to Profit in the UK
In the UK the broker recently reported a return to profitability in its operations, posting a net profit of £996,766 for the financial year
ending 30 November 2024, compared with a net loss of £2.2 million a year
earlier.
 This turnaround was
underpinned by a rise in revenue to £21.7 million from £13.4 million, while
gross profit increased to £18.1 million from £13.1 million despite sales and
hedging-related costs.
Operating profit reached £636,136, a significant improvement
on the £2.6 million operating loss recorded in the previous year. The bottom
line was further supported by a reduction in the tax charge to £48,778, down
from £332,867 in 2023.


This article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com.b:T8d5,Tomoharu Furuichi has "resigned" from his role as
Representative Director and CEO of IG Japan. He posted the news on LinkedIn
today (Thursday). He held the role for nearly seven years.
Separately, IG Securities, the Japanese arm of IG Group, has
stopped offering cryptocurrency ETF CFDs. The decision follows guidance
from Japan’s Financial Services Agency clarifying that derivatives based on
overseas crypto ETFs are treated as crypto-related products and fall under
domestic regulations, since the creation and sale of such ETFs is currently
prohibited in Japan.
IG Japan CEO Resigns After Growth
In the post, Furuichi said: “IG Japan has become several
times bigger than it used to be. It has become the largest foreign-branded
retail broker in Japan, despite operating in a smaller segment, OTC
derivatives. I have given all I could, and time has come for a new leader.”
Furuichi has held senior roles in both financial and
consumer sectors in Japan. He was CEO of GILT Groupe K.K., an online luxury
retail company with around 130 employees, for about one and a half years. He
oversaw a change program covering strategy, organization, and operations, which
led to profitability and revenue growth. He left after the parent company sold
the business.
Furuichi’s Career Spans Finance and Retail
Before that, Furuichi spent nearly six years as a director
and board member at Samantha Thavasa Japan Limited, overseeing store
operations, production and logistics, IT, HR, e-commerce, and overseas
business, while leading corporate change initiatives.
Earlier in his career, he worked for almost three years as a
senior director at AlixPartners in the Greater Tokyo Area.
New Client Discount Program Concludes
IG Japan’s subsidiary discontinued
its introductory trading program for new clients. The program, which
allowed reduced minimum trading during the first two weeks after account
opening, was phased out.
IG Japan said the decision followed earlier changes to
product sizes, which created a “more comfortable trading environment” and
reduced the need for incentives. Accounts opened before the termination date
continued to receive the program benefits until it ended.


This article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com.c:Ta93,iSAM Securities has launched CFDs on futures to meet
what it describes as growing client demand for futures-style exposure with
simpler handling. 
The CFDs include an auto-rolling feature that aims to remove
the need for clients to monitor and switch contracts at expiry while keeping
continuous exposure to the underlying futures market.
More CFD brokers are showing interest in the futures
space. Recently, NinjaTrader expanded its futures offering into Europe through Payward Europe Digital Solutions, a MiFID-regulated investment firm, initially
covering the Netherlands and Germany.
The brokers are increasingly adding futures
and options in what is seen as a response to tighter regulatory restrictions on over-the-counter
derivatives. A survey by Acuiti for CME Group indicating that four in five
firms not currently offering listed products are planning or evaluating such a
move.
Integration with Existing Infrastructure
iSAM Securities says this structure offers exposure to
futures prices while keeping the operational model in a familiar CFD format for
brokers and professional traders. The futures CFDs sit alongside iSAM Securities’
current liquidity and execution services, which use in-house pricing
technology.
According to the company, the online trading firm positions the new instruments as an extension
of its existing liquidity suite. Clients can access the CFDs on futures through
their current accounts, so they do not need additional operational setups to
trade the product.
The firm offers CFDs through entities regulated by the
Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission in the United States, as well as a Cayman Islands Monetary
Authority registered entity.
The firm has in parallel invested in risk and
analytics tools, including its RADAR real-time risk dashboard and Surge
analytics platform, which it distributes directly and through integrations such
as the cTrader link with Spotware. 
Volatility Highlights Demand for Consistent Pricing
iSAM Securities notes that recent weeks of elevated
market volatility have highlighted the importance of consistent pricing, strong
risk controls and reliable trading counterparties.
Recently, iSAM relocated to a new London headquarters
to support the expansion of its operations and growing global demand for its
services. It follows its opening of a Cyprus office in Limassol last May and
its move to a larger office in Hong Kong in June.
The Limassol office was established to support clients
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The group also maintains offices in the
United States and the Cayman Islands.

UK arm of the broker. Capital
Index UK reduced its losses in 2024, returning to a pre-tax profit
position, although it remained loss-making after tax amid a challenging retail
trading environment.
Companies House Confirms Broker Name Change
The name change was registered today (Thursday), following a
special resolution passed by the company’s members a day earlier. The company
remains incorporated in England and Wales as a private company limited by
shares and continues to operate under the same company number.
Companies House issued a new certificate of incorporation
reflecting the updated name under the Companies Act. The filing indicates that
the change was authenticated electronically by the Registrar of Companies and
does not reference any amendments to the firm’s corporate structure or
ownership.
CFD Broker Rebrands Without Regulatory Changes
Capital Index has operated as an FCA-regulated provider of
contracts for difference, offering leveraged trading across multiple asset
classes. The Companies House documents do not suggest that the rebrand is
accompanied by changes to the firm’s regulatory permissions or business
activities.
The company has not publicly disclosed the rationale behind
the rebranding, and no further details were provided in the filing.
UK CFD Broker Reports Net Loss
For the year ended 31 December 2024, the company reported a
pre-tax profit of £23,678, compared with a pre-tax loss of £207,006 a year
earlier. However, it still recorded a net loss of £18,247 after tax, marking a
second consecutive year without net profitability. 
Turnover declined by more
than 17% year-on-year, while administrative costs continued to outweigh gross
profit, with directors citing cost-of-living pressures and weaker client
activity in the UK market.

This article was written by FM Contributors at www.financemagnates.com.10:Ta8a,Startale Group and SBI Holdings have launched a
blockchain that provides exchange infrastructure for tokenized
securities and real-world asset (RWA) trading in Asia. 
Dubbed Strium, the new platform is built to support
trading and settlement of tokenized equities and RWA-linked instruments in both
spot and derivatives markets. 
It plans to operate 24/7 and focuses on
securities-linked products rather than crypto-native perpetual contracts. Strium
also separates its exchange architecture from direct asset issuance or custody
to stay compatible with existing financial systems.
Exchange Layer for Tokenized Securities
The venture builds on a partnership between Startale
and SBI last year that targeted the growing market for tokenized assets and
onchain capital markets. With Strium, the partners aim to position the network
as a core exchange layer for Asia’s onchain securities market.
“Building on the August 2025 partnership announcement,
which positioned the alliance at the forefront of the $18.9 trillion tokenized
asset market opportunity, Strium addresses a fundamental shift now
underway in institutional and professional markets,” Startale announced.

The launch of the Strium brand comes alongside proofs
of concept that test the network’s exchange architecture, settlement efficiency
and interoperability. The PoC work focuses on performance under high-load
conditions and connectivity with traditional financial infrastructure and other
blockchain networks.
The two firms earlier collaborated to develop a fully
regulated yen‑denominated stablecoin aimed at global settlement use. The
project seeks to merge traditional financial infrastructure with
blockchain‑based payment systems.

It includes the creation of a tokenized yen
tailored for enterprise applications and cross‑border transactions. The
initiative aligns with Japan’s push for digital currency frameworks.
SBI Steps Up US Push
SBI recently acquired a minority stake in US brokerage Clear Street through its American subsidiary, SBI Holdings USA, in a $50
million deal. The investment represents less than 1% of the New
York-based firm, which is preparing for an initial public offering on Nasdaq.
Alongside the capital injection, SBI and Clear Street
agreed to pursue a partnership that will establish a joint venture in Japan.
The new entity will initially concentrate on asset management services, with
plans to expand into equities trading, prime brokerage, and digital
asset-related businesses as the collaboration evolves.
