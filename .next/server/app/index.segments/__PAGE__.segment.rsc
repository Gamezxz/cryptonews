4:Ta2d,Citi cuts Coinbase price target to $400 after stock's 65% plunge from record high The bank trimmed its Coinbase revenue and earnings forecasts amid a brutal risk-off environment for crypto and delays around U.S. market structure legislation. Feb 6, 2026, 2:04 p.m. Wall Street bank Citigroup is dialing back expectations for Coinbase (COIN) amid a risk-off mood gripping markets. In a Friday note to clients, the bank's analysts lowered their price target on the crypto exchange to $400 from $505, citing weaker trading volumes, softer institutional activity and ongoing uncertainty around the timing of U.S. crypto legislation. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The new $400 price target still represents more than a doubling in price from COIN's close last night of $146. The same analyst team lifted its price target on COIN to $505 in July 2025 as the stock was hitting a record high near $450. Shares are up 6% in pre-market action on Friday as crypto markets recover a bit from Thursday's crash that saw bitcoin plunge all the way to $60,000. Despite the near-term reset, the firm reiterated its buy/high risk rating, calling Coinbase the category leader and a prime beneficiary of eventual crypto reform. Progress on CLARITY, Citi said, remains the key catalyst for reviving the stock’s momentum. The bank now expects Senate negotiations over the market structure bill to stretch beyond 2026, even as groundwork continues. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said his firm had pulled support for a sweeping digital assets bill after finding provisions that could have harmed consumers and stifled competition. The bill has repeatedly lost steam as crypto and banking lobbyists clash over stablecoin yield, while lawmakers from both parties remain deadlocked on several other provisions. Marking current crypto prices to market, analysts led by Peter Christiansen cut their near-term forecasts, trimming Coinbase fourth-quarter 2025 net revenue by roughly 10% to $1.69 billion, about 4% below consensus. After factoring in a $2.3 billion mark-to-market decline on crypto holdings and Coinbase’s equity stake in Circle (CRCL), the analysts now forecast a fourth-quarter GAAP EPS loss of $2.64. Coinbase will release fourth quarter and full year 2025 financial results after the close on February 12.

The token was trading around 17%, at press time, below its previous day’s level, reflecting sustained selling activity across derivatives and spot markets. Market data suggests that downside pressure could persist in the near term. Capital flight, declining liquidity, and increasing bearish positioning continue to weigh on price structure. Derivatives market signals capital flight Memecoins typically experience amplified losses during periods of broader market weakness, and TRUMP has followed this pattern. Perpetual futures data shows consistent capital outflows, indicating reduced risk appetite among leveraged traders. Open Interest (OI), which tracks the total capital committed to perpetual contracts, has declined sharply. Over the observed period, $21.67 million exited TRUMP perpetual contracts, leaving approximately $99.22 million in remaining OI. Source: CoinGlass Funding Rate data further reinforces the bearish setup. The Funding Rate has turned negative, indicating that short positions are paying longs and that bearish traders currently dominate positioning. If declining OI persists alongside negative funding rates, price discovery is likely to remain biased to the downside as losses deepen. Spot market distribution intensifies Spot investors have also contributed to the downside risk. According to CoinGlass data , spot market participants have been net sellers over the past two weeks. Between the weekend ending January 26 and this week, cumulative spot sales reached approximately 8.13 million units, confirming a sustained period of distribution. Source: CoinGlass With limited spot demand supporting price, downside risk increases. The current market structure shows a bearish divergence, with price continuing to make lower lows while trading volume expands. At press time, trading volume has risen by 100% to roughly $522 million, even as price trends lower. This divergence indicates strengthening seller momentum and suggests that downside pressure could persist until selling activity shows signs of exhaustion. World liberty financial and market sentiment Market sentiment around TRUMP’s underperformance has also been influenced by developments involving World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto firm backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. According to Arkham Intelligence, WLFI has recently reduced its crypto exposure. During Bitcoin’s move toward $69,000, the firm sold approximately $23.56 million worth of Bitcoin in the past day. Following these sales, WLFI’s remaining Bitcoin holdings stand at around $10.9 million, while its total crypto holdings, according to Arkham Intelligence , remain substantial at approximately $5.05 billion at the time of writing. Although no direct link has been established between these actions and TRUMP’s price decline, the reduction in exposure by a high-profile, Trump-affiliated entity has contributed to broader market uncertainty and reinforced bearish sentiment surrounding the token. Across both derivatives and spot markets, TRUMP continues to face sustained selling pressure. Shrinking capital, negative funding rates, rising volume, and ongoing spot distribution collectively point to a fragile price structure. Until capital flows stabilize and seller momentum weakens, downside risks remain elevated. Final Thoughts TRUMP recorded significant capital exits over the past 24 hours as both perpetual traders and spot investors turned net sellers. Market attention has shifted to World Liberty Financial following reports of reduced crypto exposure, adding to bearish sentiment.6:T775,Turkey has renewed its efforts to join the BRICS alliance in 2026, but this time is seeking China’s help to secure membership. Despite submitting a formal application in 2024, the country was denied full membership in the alliance. However, the transcontinental nation is actively seeking to join the bloc and deepen its ties with existing members. Turkey’s new Ambassador to China, Selçuk Ünal , is holding talks with Beijing to secure a full BRICS membership. Ankara is yet again demonstrating interest in being a part of the grouping to give the alliance a financial boost. Apart from Turkey, even Pakistan remains in talks with China to join the bloc. India is firmly against Pakistan’s inclusion, as both nations have been at odds for decades.

Here’s How Many Countries Are Awaiting Membership Approval Source: Getty Images The upcoming BRICS summit is scheduled to be held in India’s capital, New Delhi, this year. The dates are yet to be announced, and we could see a flood of changes this time around. The induction into BRICS is consensus-based and needs the approval of all existing members for Turkey to be a part of the bloc. If all BRICS members unanimously agree for Turkey to join BRICS, then the country will be inducted in 2026. A total of 45 countries have already expressed their interest in joining the bloc. Around 23 countries have formally submitted their applications, while the others have informally expressed their interest. Not all of them will be inducted into BRICS, and Turkey might or might not be one of them. The alliance will weigh in on the pros and cons of induction and what the country can offer financially, and bring in changes to the table. Whether the transcontinental nation will make it this year, the answer will come at the 2026 summit.7:Tbf8,Bitcoin Core developer Gloria Zhao has stepped down as a maintainer and revoked her Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) signing key, ending about six years as one of the project’s gatekeepers. On Thursday, Zhao submitted her last pull request to the Bitcoin GitHub repository, removing her key from the trusted keys and withdrawing herself as one of the few maintainers able to update Bitcoin’s software. Becoming the first known female maintainer in 2022, she focused on mempool policy and transaction relay: the rules and peer‑to‑peer logic that decide which transactions get into nodes’ waiting rooms and how quickly they propagate across the network. Gloria Zhao quite Bitcoin maintainer role. Source: GitHub She helped design and implement package relay ( BIP 331 ) and TRUC (Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation, BIP 431 ), along with upgrades to replace‑by‑fee (RBF) and broader P2P behavior, making fee bumping more reliable and reducing censorship. Zhao’s work was funded through Brink, where she became the organization’s first fellow in 2021, with her fellowship backed by the Human Rights Foundation’s Bitcoin Development Fund and Jack Dorsey’s Spiral (formerly Square Crypto), placing her among a small cohort of publicly supported, full‑time open‑source Bitcoin protocol engineers. Beyond her technical contributions, Zhao mentored new contributors and co‑ran the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club, helping junior developers learn how to review complex changes and navigate Core’s conservative review culture. Related: Bitcoin Core v30 bug risks fund loss during legacy wallet upgrades Split over OP_RETURN and Knots Her resignation comes after more than a year of public disputes between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots , and the removal of OP_RETURN limits, a fight over whether Bitcoin’s default node software should make it harder to use block space for non‑monetary data. In 2025, Zhao deleted her X account amid personal attacks during the OP_RETURN war, after a livestream in which a core developer questioned her credentials. While some Bitcoin Core critics celebrated Zhao’s departure, others took a more somber tone. “They bullied her and made her life as miserable as possible until she rage quit, and quite frankly, I think what they did to her was tragic,” said pseudonymous Bitcoiner Pledditor. Pledditor added that it set a “terrible precedent” and called it, “sad and pathetic. “Congratulations you finally did it. You bullied one of Bitcoin Core's most prolific and consistently excellent maintainers until she gave up,” said Chris Seedor, co-founder and CEO at Bitcoin wallet backup company Seedor.

While the move does not confirm an imminent spot listing, it marks the first formal signal from a major U.S. exchange that Pi could be under consideration for broader market access. The update arrives at a critical moment for Pi, which has been struggling with heavy price pressure and weakening investor confidence. What Kraken’s Roadmap Update Really Means Kraken’s roadmap outlines digital assets that may be listed in the future, subject to regulatory, technical, and liquidity requirements. Pi Network now appears alongside other potential listings such as Conflux and Pepecoin. Importantly, the exchange has not committed to a timeline or guaranteed spot trading support. This development builds on Kraken’s earlier move to launch Pi perpetual futures in 2025. That product allowed traders to take both long and short positions using more than 40 supported collateral assets, increasing Pi’s exposure within derivatives markets even as spot trading remained limited. Pi Network’s Uneven Exchange Presence Currently, Pi Coin is already available for spot trading on exchanges like OKX and Bitget, offering some liquidity to the market. However, the absence of listings on top-tier platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, and Robinhood has remained a major hurdle for broader adoption. In Binance’s case, industry watchers have long speculated about a potential listing, but those expectations have repeatedly stalled. Ongoing leadership controversies within Pi Network appear to be one of the factors dampening progress with major U.S. and global exchanges. Pi Current Market Sentiment Pi Network remains under heavy pressure after sliding 9% on Thursday and breaking below the key $0.1533 support, a level that previously marked the October 10 low. Although the price bounced slightly from a fresh record low near $0.1300, the relief appears limited as bearish momentum still dominates. Technical indicators underline the weakness, with the RSI stuck deep in oversold territory around 20, signaling aggressive selling, while the MACD continues to trend lower in negative territory, reinforcing downside pressure. With momentum tilted firmly toward sellers, PI appears to be entering a price-discovery phase, leaving the $0.100 listing price as the next major reference level. Any meaningful recovery would require a clear reclaim of the $0.1533 zone to ease selling pressure and stabilize price action. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs Is Pi Coin listed on Kraken? No, Pi Coin is not currently listed for spot trading on Kraken. However, Kraken has added Pi Network to its 2026 asset roadmap for potential future listing, following its 2025 launch of Pi perpetual futures contracts. Is Pi Coin available for trading on major exchanges? Pi Coin trades on platforms like OKX and Bitget, but top-tier exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have yet to list it. Why is Pi Coin’s price under pressure? Heavy selling, weak investor confidence, and technical resistance near $0.1533 are driving Pi Coin’s recent price decline. What is the future outlook for Pi Network? The future outlook remains uncertain. While Kraken’s interest is a positive signal, Pi Network faces hurdles like exchange adoption delays and internal controversies. Price recovery requires stabilizing above previous key support levels.

Amid the bearish outlook of the leading cryptocurrency asset, Bitcoin (BTC), some stakeholders remain concerned about quantum threats. One of them, Capriole founder Charles Edwards, insists that quantum computing threats are real and long-term issues that need urgent attention and action. Quantum computing risk not Bitcoin price driver According to Edwards, there is a strong need in 2026 to tackle the potential challenges that quantum computers could pose to Bitcoin. He maintains that the Bitcoin community has to do something to secure the asset and other blockchains, not in the future but now. Meanwhile, Edwards says quantum computer threats do not justify the current bearish price of Bitcoin. "It does not justify prices of $60K today, it's more than fully priced in," Edwards wrote. Notably, some segments of the crypto community argue that Bitcoin’s price should be high right now because of looming quantum risk. They believe that upgrades would make Bitcoin stronger and safe, thereby increasing its value. The Quantum threat is big and must be addressed with urgency this year. That said, it does not justify prices of $60K _today_, it's more than fully priced in. — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) February 6, 2026 Additionally, with "race to safety" narratives circulating, Bitcoin should begin to climb in value. However, Edwards says this logic is not sound as quantum risk is not a valid reason because the market has already accounted for the quantum narrative. It appears that a Bitcoin accumulator, Strategy’s Michael Saylor , is already making moves to address quantum computer threats. As per reports, Strategy is planning to launch a Bitcoin security program that would tap into communities for solutions to the threat. However, unlike Edwards, Saylor believes the threat is still more than 10 years away, and most industry players are still relying on traditional cryptography. He thinks that a shift to protect against quantum threats would be arrived at via consensus. Another renowned voice in the industry, Craig Wright — the self-styled Satoshi Nakamoto from Australia — has dismissed threats from quantum computers . Wright refers to the narratives as "bedtime stories." He insists that the fears are just noise, as no quantum computer can break a hash. You Might Also Like Experts downplay panic from quantum threat Interestingly, Craig Wright is not alone in this line of reasoning. A Google veteran, Graham Cooke , has stated that the math behind wallets remain stronger than the "fabric of space time." He argues that even if there are advances in quantum computing, the mathematics protecting digital assets remain foolproof against any threats. For his part, JAN3 CEO Samson Mow has said people in the crypto space should stop stressing themselves over the "wrong things" when reacting to quantum threats. Mow maintained there is no need to worry.a:T41a,Capriole founder Charles Edwards asserts that while the threat of quantum computing to Bitcoin (BTC) is a real and urgent long-term issue, it does not justify the asset's current bearish price action. He argues that the market has "more than fully priced in" the quantum risk, dismissing claims that Bitcoin should command a premium now due to potential future security upgrades. Edwards emphasizes the need for the Bitcoin community to act immediately to secure the network against these threats.

However, industry leaders offer varying perspectives on the severity and timeline of the quantum risk. Strategy's Michael Saylor is preparing a Bitcoin security program to crowdsource solutions, yet he estimates the threat is still over a decade away and will be addressed via consensus. Conversely, prominent skeptics like Craig Wright and Google veteran Graham Cooke downplay the narrative, with Wright calling it a "bedtime story" and Cooke maintaining that the mathematical foundations of wallets remain superior to potential quantum capabilities.b:T1cca,A wallet attributed to President Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial, which is managed by his sons, withdrew approximately 173 wrapped Bitcoin from Aave V3 on Feb. 5 and sold them to repay $11.75 million in stablecoin debt. This sequence reveals the mechanics of voluntary deleveraging: as Bitcoin's drawdown below $63,000 forces whales to sell collateral and reduce leverage, protocol liquidation engines trigger at worse terms. The address 0x77a…F94F6, labeled as WLFI on Arkham Intelligence, withdrew roughly 73 WBTC and 100 WBTC from Aave V3's collateral pool, then repaid 5,037,001 USDC and 6,710,808 USDC to the protocol in separate actions. Although there is no confirmation regarding the wallet's ownership, on-chain intelligence platforms and prior reporting have linked similar activity patterns to World Liberty Financial's documented positions on Aave involving WBTC and ETH collateral. Nevertheless, the wallet turned Bitcoin exposure into cash to reduce leverage and raise health factor buffers. The wallet still holds substantial exposure, with approximately 13,298 WETH and 167 WBTC as Aave collateral backing $18.47 million in variable-rate USDC debt. However, its health factor now stands at 1.54, comfortably above Aave's liquidation threshold of 1.0. Line graph showing Aave health factor declining from 1.54 to 1.0 as collateral drops approximately 35%, with liquidation threshold marked at health factor 1.0. Why whales are selling collateral now Chaos Labs reported approximately $140 million in Aave V3 liquidations over 24 hours during a recent wave . Meanwhile, 21shares flagged $3.7 billion in liquidations over the weekend. Those figures reveal leverage being flushed system-wide, not just on Aave or decentralized lending, as positions hit health factor thresholds and protocols force collateral sales to cover bad debt. The difference between voluntary and forced deleveraging is execution quality, not market impact. Selling 173 WBTC at $69,000 generated roughly $12 million, enough to cover the debt repayment. Waiting until the health factor drops below 1.0 means Aave auctions the same collateral at 5-10% discounts during stress periods, leaving the whale unable to control the timing. Both outcomes remove Bitcoin from the market and eliminate the leverage that would have recycled capital into future purchases. At a health factor of 1.54, the wallet has runway but not comfort. A 38% drawdown in collateral value would trigger liquidation . Bitcoin has already fallen by up to 50% from its peak, and technical models point to $38,000 as a potential support level, suggesting another 43% decline from current prices. That makes selling collateral to raise health factor buffers rational risk management, even if it adds selling pressure. Timeline diagram showing voluntary deleveraging sequence where a wallet withdrew 173 WBTC from Aave V3, converted it to USDC, then repaid $11.75 million in stablecoin debt over seven hours on Feb. 5. The feedback loop across markets Aave's variable borrow rates respond to utilization . As whales deleverage and demand for stablecoin liquidity spikes, borrowing costs rise. That increases the carrying cost of leverage, pushing more whales to trim positions. Simultaneously, exit liquidity deteriorates: bid-ask spreads widen, orderbook depth shrinks, and slippage on large trades increases. The result is a feedback loop where selling begets more selling, not from panic but from balance-sheet arithmetic. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows compound the pressure. Crypto's total market capitalization decreased to below $2.1 trillion from its Oct. 6 peak, coinciding with persistent ETF outflows as institutional allocators rotate toward safer assets. 21Shares flagged heavy redemption days in recent weeks. When ETFs were accumulating through 2024 and early 2025, they absorbed supply during volatility. That bid has reversed, leaving DeFi whales as the marginal price-setters, and those whales are now selling collateral to repay debt rather than adding exposure. Three paths forward Orderly deleveraging is the base case. CryptoSlate Daily Brief Daily signals, zero noise. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. 5-minute digest 100k+ readers Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. Whales sell collateral gradually, repay debt, and reduce leverage without triggering mass liquidations. Markets stabilize at lower prices with less leverage, but persistent selling pressure from collateral sales and the disappearance of reflexive bids keep recovery attempts shallow. Auction cascade is the downside scenario. Another sharp leg down triggers protocol liquidations before whales can act voluntarily. Aave, Compound , and other platforms compete to clear bad debt, processing collateral faster than markets can absorb it. Liquidation volume spikes, spreads blow out, and forced sales at auction discounts amplify the drawdown. Cross-market liquidity shocks constitute tail risk. ETF outflows accelerate, derivative open interest continues compressing, and whales rush to sell collateral before becoming the last through the exit. Voluntary deleveraging and forced liquidations combine to create dislocations in which spot prices diverge from derivatives, or on-chain venues trade at discounts to centralized exchanges. Feature Voluntary deleveraging (sell/repay early) Forced liquidation (auction) Why it matters in this drawdown Timing control High None Avoids selling into worst liquidity Execution price Market/slippage Auction discount (stress) Forced sales amplify downside Position outcome Reduced leverage, higher HF Collateral seized Changes behavior from “diamond hands” to “runway management” Market impact Distributed sell pressure Spiky liquidation prints Explains why drawdowns can accelerate What collateral sales signal The 173 WBTC sale to generate debt repayment isn't an isolated event but a data point within a broader pattern evident across liquidation metrics, open interest compression, and ETF flows. Whales aren't capitulating. Instead, they're converting Bitcoin into stablecoins to manage health factors and extend runway. That prevents cascades, but it doesn't stop drawdowns. Lower leverage means less capital is recycled into purchases. The reflexive bid that drove Bitcoin from $30,000 to $100,000 operated through leverage: whales borrowed against collateral to buy more Bitcoin, amplifying gains. In reverse, whales sell collateral to repay debt, removing both the exposure and the mechanism that would amplify recoveries. Spot ETF outflows remove the institutional buyers who previously absorbed this supply. The liquidity vacuum left behind means sell pressure from deleveraging whales meets weaker demand from all buyer categories, as institutional allocators rotate to safety, leveraged traders cut risk, and retail participants wait for clearer signals. The wallet's $11.75 million debt repayment, funded by selling 173 WBTC, crystallizes the choice facing every leveraged position: manage the exit now or let protocol mechanics decide later. Most are choosing now, and the cumulative impact of those individual decisions is a market where conviction plus scale no longer equals compounding. It equals orderly liquidation, one WBTC sale at a time.

Their decline follows the announcement of a Democrat investigation into a business deal between Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan and World Liberty Financial prior to Donald Trump’s inauguration. Analysts suggest that the wider market selloff may stabilize once leverage clears and ETF inflows resume. Official Trump (TRUMP) and World Liberty Financial (WLFI) have fallen 14.6% and 10.8% in the past 24 hours, as the cryptocurrency market continues to weather steep losses amid falling sentiment . TRUMP is now priced at $3.41, marking a 24.7% loss in a week, a 37.7% drop in a month, and a 95% collapse since the Trump-linked meme coin hit a record high of $37.43 in January of last year, per CoinGecko data . Meanwhile, World Liberty Financial’s governance and utility token, WLFI, has sunk to $0.111 , a 25.3% drop in a week, a 34.7% fall in a month, and a 67% decline since reaching an ATH of $0.3313 last September. Few coins have escaped today’s sharp fall, with the crypto market’s total capitalization dropping by 2.8% in the past 24 hours, to $2.37 trillion. But while Bitcoin and other leading tokens have suffered in recent days, the two Trump family-linked tokens have suffered more than most, with their situation exacerbated by recent news. World Liberty Financial deal faces House probe Yesterday, Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) launched an investigation into “how conflicts of interest may be influencing U.S. government policies” in relation to sectors in which the U.S. is in competition with China. In particular, Khanna has written a letter to World Liberty Financial, requesting information on the $500 million investment deal the Trump family-owned company made with ‘Spy Sheikh’ Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the UAE’s royal family. The launch of this investigation follows a report from the Wall Street Journal , which on January 31 reported that the investment preceded a subsequent deal in which the Trump administration agreed to send roughly 500,000 advanced AI chips to the UAE, including to Tahnoon’s own AI firm, G42. The Biden administration had previously blocked similar deals, on the grounds that G42 had links to the sanctioned technology firm Huawei, as well as other Chinese companies. Based on such reporting, the press release announcing the Khanna-led investigation argued that “it’s wrong to implicate the President’s personal financial interests in policy decisions.” The investigation is also seeking info regarding World Liberty Financial’s “facilitation” of a $2 billion investment by Abu Dhabi-based MGX in Binance , which investment was made in USD1, a stablecoin launched and operated by the company. The announcement of this investigation follows comments earlier this week from Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT), who suggested that the previously undisclosed investment from Tahnoon amounted to “ open corruption .” World Liberty Financial counts Donald Trump and Steve Witkoff, the president’s Special Envoy to the Middle East, as “co-founders emeritus.” Witkoff’s son Zach serves as CEO of the firm, which asserts that neither Trump nor his family members hold any role as “director, officer or employee.” World Liberty Financial has been contacted for comment. Crypto market slumps According to eToro analyst Simon Peters, risk-off sentiment is continuing to weigh heavily on the market and wider industry. He told Decrypt , “Recent geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, disappointing earnings forecasts and the threat of quantum computing is causing institutional investors to rethink tech valuations and their exposure to crypto.” Peters notes that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen some of their biggest ever days in terms of outflows recently, which has caused selling pressure and also precipitated a cascade of liquidations . He added, “For the technical analysts, Bitcoin is not far off its 200-week moving average [currently between $55,000 and $58,000], which historically has acted as a strong level of support following major corrections – 2015, 2018, 2020 (during the Covid pandemic) and most recently in 2022.” Daily Debrief Newsletter Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.f:T13c5,The crypto market has just experienced one of its sharpest sell-offs on record, with Bitcoin plunging nearly $10,000 in a single day and briefly touching the $60,000 level. The sudden collapse triggered widespread panic, wiping out more than $2 billion in leveraged positions, most of them from traders betting on higher prices. U.S. stock markets also showed clear signs of stress, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slipping below key technical levels. Broader macroeconomic pressures added fuel to the fire. Weaker-than-expected U.S. job openings data sparked fresh selling in equities, which quickly spilled over into crypto. Major technology stocks, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta, fell to recent lows, reinforcing a risk-off environment across global markets. Capitulation Phase Signals Emerge as Bitcoin Volatility and Fear Spike Despite a major crypto crash, market data suggests the sell-off may be approaching a point of exhaustion. Bitcoin’s price volatility has surged to levels seen only a few times in its history, often associated with major market stress events. Forced liquidations in the futures market have reached extreme levels, driving sharp sell-offs followed by sudden rebounds. These violent intraday moves reflect a market dominated by panic rather than rational positioning. Several additional indicators point to extreme fear. Bitcoin is now as oversold as it was during the March 2020 market crash, one of the most dramatic downturns in crypto history. Overall sentiment across the crypto market has dropped to one of its lowest readings on record, with traders rushing to exit positions at nearly any price. These conditions resemble a classic capitulation phase, where panic selling peaks and weaker hands are flushed out of the market. However, capitulation does not guarantee an immediate recovery. In previous market cycles, Bitcoin often required weeks or even months to form a durable bottom after similar events. Bitcoin Bear Market Timeline Points to Further Downside Risks Looking at the broader cycle, earlier Bitcoin bear markets generally lasted around 12 to 14 months from peak to trough. If this cycle follows a similar trajectory, the market may still face further downside or an extended phase of sideways consolidation before stability returns. For now, traders are closely watching key downside levels. Bitcoin could revisit the $57,000 zone, which has previously acted as an important support area. Below that, the $54,000–$55,000 range remains another critical level, as it held during earlier periods of broader market weakness. Ethereum, XRP, and Solana Struggle as Altcoin Sell-Off Intensifies Altcoins have suffered heavy losses, with market structure across most tokens remaining weak. Ethereum continues to face strong selling pressure and could slide toward the $1,500 level or lower if current conditions persist. XRP is drifting closer to $0.60, with no clear signs yet that the downtrend has ended. Solana has dropped sharply into the $60–$70 range following a steep sell-off. While short-term rebounds of 30% or more are possible, analysts warn that any recovery is likely to remain volatile and occur within a broader downtrend. Other major tokens, including Cardano, Avalanche, and Sui, are also approaching key support zones where brief relief rallies could emerge. Stablecoin Inflows Grow as USDT Dominance Weighs on Bitcoin Meanwhile, USDT dominance has surged to new highs, signaling that investors are moving capital into stablecoins. Although this move appears stretched in the short term, sustained strength in USDT dominance would be bearish for Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. A clear pullback in stablecoin dominance could trigger a strong relief rally, potentially pushing Bitcoin back toward the $70,000–$80,000 range. However, analysts caution that positioning aggressively for this scenario remains risky given the current macro and market conditions.

They serve as a temporary black box to disrupt traceability. Hackers typically move funds through consolidation, obfuscation and chain hopping and only then introduce privacy layers before attempting to cash out. Privacy coins are most useful immediately after a hack because they reduce onchain visibility, delay blacklisting and help break attribution links. Enforcement actions against mixers and other laundering tools often shift illicit flows toward alternative routes, including privacy coins. After crypto hacks occur, scammers often move stolen funds through privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. While this has created a perception of hackers preferring privacy coins, these assets function as a specialized “black box” within a larger laundering pipeline. To understand why privacy coins show up after hacks, you need to take into account the process of crypto laundering. This article explores how funds move post-hack and what makes privacy coins so useful for scammers. It examines emerging laundering methods, limitations of privacy coins like Monero ( XMR ) and Zcash ( ZEC ) as laundering tools, legitimate uses of privacy technologies and why regulators need to balance innovation with the need to curb laundering . How funds flow after a hack Following a hack , scammers don’t usually send stolen assets directly to an exchange for immediate liquidation; instead, they follow a deliberate, multi-stage process to obscure the trail and slow down the inquiry: Consolidation: Funds from multiple victim addresses are transferred to a smaller number of wallets. Obfuscation: Assets are shuffled through chains of intermediary crypto wallets , often with the help of crypto mixers . Chain-hopping: Funds are bridged or swapped to different blockchains , breaking continuity within any single network’s tracking tools. Privacy layer: A portion of funds is converted into privacy-focused assets or routed through privacy-preserving protocols. Cash-out: Assets are eventually exchanged for more liquid cryptocurrencies or fiat through centralized exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) desks or peer-to-peer (P2P) channels. Privacy coins usually enter the stage in steps four or five, blurring the traceability of lost funds even more after earlier steps have already complicated the onchain history. Why privacy coins are attractive for scammers right after a hack Privacy coins offer specific advantages right at the time when scammers are most vulnerable, immediately after the theft. Reduced onchain visibility Unlike transparent blockchains, where the sender and receiver and transaction amounts remain fully auditable, privacy-focused systems deliberately hide these details. Once funds move into such networks, standard blockchain analytics lose much of their efficacy. In the aftermath of the theft, scammers try to delay identification or evade automated address blacklisting by exchanges and services. The sudden drop in visibility is particularly valuable in the critical days after theft when monitoring is most intense. Breaking attribution chains Scammers tend not to move directly from hacked assets into privacy coins. They typically use multiple techniques, swaps, cross-chain bridges and intermediary wallets before introducing a privacy layer. This multi-step approach makes it significantly harder to connect the final output back to the original hack. Privacy coins act more as a strategic firebreak in the attribution process than as a standalone laundering tool. Negotiating power in OTC and P2P markets Many laundering paths involve informal OTC brokers or P2P traders who operate outside extensively regulated exchanges. Using privacy-enhanced assets reduces the information counterparties have about the funds’ origin. This can simplify negotiations, lower the perceived risk of mid-transaction freezes and improve the attacker’s leverage in less transparent markets. Did you know? Several early ransomware groups originally demanded payment in Bitcoin ( BTC ) but later switched to privacy coins only after exchanges began cooperating more closely with law enforcement on address blacklisting. The mixer squeeze and evolving methods of laundering One reason privacy coins appear more frequently in specific time frames is enforcement pressure on other laundering tools. When law enforcement targets particular mixers, bridges or high-risk exchanges, illicit funds simply move to other channels. This shift results in the diversification of laundering routes across various blockchains, swapping platforms and privacy-focused networks. When scammers perceive one laundering route as risky, alternative routes experience higher volumes. Privacy coins gain from this dynamic, as they offer inherent transaction obfuscation, independent of third-party services. Limitations of privacy coins as a laundering tool Privacy features notwithstanding, most large-scale hacks still involve extensive use of BTC, Ether ( ETH ) and stablecoins at later stages. The reason is straightforward: Liquidity and exit options are important. Privacy coins generally exhibit: Reduced trading volumes Limited listings on major centralized exchanges Heightened regulatory oversight. These factors complicate the conversion of substantial amounts of crypto to fiat currency without drawing scrutiny. Therefore, scammers use privacy coins briefly before reverting to more liquid assets prior to final withdrawal. Successful laundering involves integration of privacy-enhancing tools with high-liquidity assets, tailored to each phase of the process. Did you know? Some darknet marketplaces now list prices in Monero by default, even if they still accept Bitcoin, because vendors prefer not to reveal their income patterns or customer volume. Behavioral trends in asset laundering While tactical specifics vary, blockchain analysts generally identify several high-level “red flags” in illicit fund flows: Layering and consolidation: Rapid dispersal of assets across a vast network of wallets, followed by strategic reaggregation to simplify the final exit. Chain hopping: Moving assets across multiple blockchains to break the deterministic link of a single ledger, often sandwiching privacy-enhancing protocols. Strategic latency: Allowing funds to remain dormant for extended periods to bypass the window of heightened public and regulatory scrutiny. Direct-to-fiat workarounds: Preferring OTC brokers for the final liquidation to avoid the robust monitoring systems of major exchanges. Hybrid privacy: Using privacy-centric coins as a specialized tool within a broader laundering strategy, rather than as a total replacement for mainstream assets. Contours of anonymity: Why traceability persists Despite the hurdles created by privacy-preserving technologies, investigators continue to secure wins by targeting the edges of the ecosystem. Progress is typically made through: Regulated gateways: Forcing interactions with exchanges that mandate rigorous identity verification Human networks: Targeting the physical infrastructure of money-mule syndicates and OTC desks Off-chain intelligence: Leveraging traditional surveillance, confidential informants and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) Operational friction: Exploiting mistakes made by the perpetrator that link their digital footprint to a real-world identity. Privacy coins increase the complexity and cost of an investigation, but they cannot fully insulate scammers from the combined pressure of forensic analysis and traditional law enforcement. Did you know? Blockchain analytics firms often focus less on privacy coins themselves and more on tracing how funds enter and exit them since those boundary points offer the most reliable investigative signals. Reality of legitimate use for privacy-enhancing technologies It is essential to distinguish between the technology itself and its potential criminal applications. Privacy-focused financial tools, such as certain cryptocurrencies or mixers, serve valid purposes, including: Safeguarding the confidentiality of commercial transactions, which includes protecting trade secrets or competitive business dealings Shielding individuals from surveillance or monitoring in hostile environments Reducing the risk of targeted theft by limiting public visibility of personal wealth. Regulatory scrutiny isn’t triggered by the mere existence of privacy features, but when they are used for illicit activity, such as ransomware payments, hacking proceeds, sanctions evasion or darknet marketplaces. This key distinction makes effective policymaking difficult. Broad prohibitions risk curtailing lawful financial privacy for ordinary users and businesses while often failing to halt criminal networks that shift to alternative methods. Balancing act of regulators For cryptocurrency exchanges, the recurring appearance of privacy coins in post-hack laundering flows intensifies the need to: Enhance transaction monitoring and risk assessment Reduce exposure to high-risk inflows Strengthen compliance with cross-border Travel Rule requirements and other jurisdictional standards. For policymakers, it underscores a persistent challenge: Criminal actors adapt more quickly than rigid regulations can evolve. Efforts to crack down on one tool often displace activity to others, turning money laundering into a dynamic, moving target rather than a problem that can be fully eradicated.

Trend Research dumps over 400K ETH as liquidation risk rises Ethereum investment vehicle Trend Research continued to reduce its Ether exposure, as the latest market crash pushed the treasury company to sell off its assets to pay back loans. It held about 651,170 Ether ( ETH ) in the form of Aave Ethereum wrapped Ether (AETHWETH) on Sunday. That amount dropped by 404,090, to about 247,080 on Friday, at the time of writing. Trend Research transferred 411,075 ETH to cryptocurrency exchange Binance since the beginning of the month, according to blockchain data platform Arkham. Trend Research, WETH token balance history, one-week chart. Source: Arkham The transfers occurred as ETH price dropped almost 30% in the past week, to as low as $1,748 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. It traded at $1,967 at the time of writing. Trend Research has been tied to Jack Yi, founder of Hong Kong-based crypto venture firm Liquid Capital. Yi accumulated his Ethereum investment company’s holdings by purchasing ETH at an exchange, using that as collateral on Aave to borrow stablecoins, then using those funds to acquire more ETH. Crypto sentiment hits 2022 lows as Bitcoin crashes to $60,000 Crypto market sentiment slumped to its lowest level in over three and a half years on Friday, returning to levels last seen during the massive Terra blockchain collapse, as Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a 24-hour low of $60,000. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to a score of 9 out of 100 on Friday, its lowest point since June 2022, when sentiment fell alongside the market in the wake of the collapse of the Terra blockchain a month earlier. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit a score of 9 out of 100 on Friday as Bitcoin continued to slide. Source: Alternative.me It came as Bitcoin had fallen around 13% over the past 24 hours and had lost over $10,000, its largest in a day since mid-2022. Its price hit a low of $60,000 on Coinbase late on Thursday, falling by over 50% from its peak of $126,000 in early October. CoinEx Research chief analyst Jeff Ko told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s drawdown comes alongside a selloff in US tech stocks, “where stretched valuations and lingering concerns around an artificial intelligence-driven bubble have long been highlighted by the market.” Polymarket, Circle partner to move prediction market to native USDC settlement Decentralized prediction market Polymarket has partnered with stablecoin issuer Circle to transition its platform to native USDC ( USDC ) settlement, replacing the bridged USDC.e currently used on Polygon. The move will see Polymarket shift away from bridge-based settlement infrastructure toward Circle-issued USDC, which is fully backed and redeemable for US dollars. According to the companies, the change is intended to reduce the complexity and risk associated with cross-chain bridges while improving capital efficiency. Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan said the transition supports a consistent, dollar-denominated settlement standard as the platform scales. The partnership reflects a broader trend in crypto toward native stablecoin settlement as onchain markets mature and infrastructure providers prioritize security and regulatory alignment.

Chinese regulators have issued a new joint notice reinforcing their hardline stance on cryptocurrencies, with particular emphasis on banning the issuance of stablecoins, as eight departments, including the People’s Bank of China and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, move to address renewed risks from virtual asset speculation and real-world asset tokenization. Building on the 2021 crackdown, the notice reiterates that virtual currencies, including stablecoins such as Tether, have no legal tender status and that related business activities constitute illegal financial activities. It stresses that stablecoins pegged to legal tender perform currency-like functions and therefore implicate monetary sovereignty, making them subject to strict state control. Under the new rules, without lawful approval from relevant authorities, no domestic or overseas entity or individual may issue stablecoins pegged to the renminbi overseas, and domestic firms are prohibited from participating in or facilitating such activities through overseas affiliates. Regulators said the unauthorized issuance and related services could expose the financial system to money laundering, fraud, and cross-border capital risks, and undermine national financial security. The notice also strengthens oversight of financial, intermediary, and technology service providers, requires tighter compliance and internal controls, and establishes a coordinated enforcement framework between central and local authorities. Officials said regulators will intensify monitoring of capital and information flows, crack down on illegal issuance and promotion, and expand public education efforts to ensure strict implementation of the stablecoin ban and safeguard monetary stability. This is a developing story. Please come back for further updates.13:T63c,China has banned unapproved offshore yuan-pegged stablecoins to stop crypto-based capital flight and financial crime. The People’s Bank of China repeated its strict ban on crypto activity, citing risks tied to money laundering and foreign exchange fraud. Hong Kong regulators also warned that no licenses have been issued, and promoting such stablecoins is illegal. The move targets offshore RMB tokens like CNH stablecoins and supports China’s push toward its digital yuan, the eCNY.

Erasing every gain since Trump’s election and completing a full 50% drawdown from October’s $126,000 all-time high. 📌 What Happened Bitcoin plunged 14% in a single day , triggering over $2B in crypto liquidations and sending the Fear & Greed Index to 5 “extreme fear” territory, a level not seen in several years. The selling accelerated through the session, with BTC briefly touching $60,000 before a modest bounce ($66,000 this morning). The carnage wasn’t contained to spot. Over $1.1B in Bitcoin derivatives alone were liquidated. XRP led altcoin losses , down 20%+, while Ethereum fell 15% to $1,750 and Solana cratered to $69. This all played out while Strategy reported a $12.4 billion Q4 loss Thursday afternoon, with MSTR shares hitting an 18-month low at $107 - down 76% from last year’s peak. Bitcoin dipped below Strategy’s $76,000 average cost basis earlier this week, putting the company’s 713,502 BTC holdings ($45B) underwater for the first time since 2023. Meanwhile, Stifel analysts warned that BTC could fall as low as $38,000 if headwinds persist. On Myriad, traders are putting a 65% chance on Bitcoin hitting $55K before $84K. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “It’s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,” said Nic Puckrin of Coin Bureau. “This is no longer a short-term correction, but a transition from distribution to reset - and these typically take months, not weeks.” Strategy CFO Andrew Kang tried to steady nerves on the earnings call: “Our strategy is built for the long term. It’s built to withstand short-term price volatility, even extreme conditions like we’re seeing today.” 🧠 Why It Matters There’s no sugar coating it—this is a rough stretch for crypto. Here are some of the leading takes and narratives on why crypto has been underperforming: Gold won. It was supposed to be Bitcoin’s moment (dollar doubt, sovereign stress) but capital fled to gold instead. Makes it much harder to believe the “digital gold” narrative. AI is eating crypto’s lunch. Mindshare, talent, and capital are all flowing to AI. If you have cheap power, why mine BTC when you could build a data center? The Trump bet imploded. Crypto traded as a Trump proxy and his approval rating is at lows. Regulatory progress could reverse. Institutional adoption isn’t helping tokens. Wall Street loves stablecoins, RWAs and tokenization - but value isn’t accruing to ETH, SOL, or existing networks. DATs are now a liability. Treasury companies below NAV invite activists to liquidate underlying BTC / DAT tokens. No excuses left. The double-edged sword of the crypto-positive Trump admin - now we can’t blame hostile regulators for the pain. We’re not early anymore. ETFs exist. Zero barriers. Fully mainstream. And prices are still down. There are plenty of other reasons to help cope with pain and describe why price action is bad, but that’s enough for today. So where does this leave us? In the “stress zone” where long-term holders historically accumulate and short-term holders panic. I’m personally getting texts from “What’s going on with crypto?” - typically a sign that we’re near a bottom (local at least). It’s hard to predict near-term price action and I certainly don’t have a crystal ball. But $60k seems much more likely to be closer to the bottom than the top. We will find out soon enough. 🌎 Macro Crypto and Markets Crypto majors are very red another 5-8% after another brutal selloff that saw BTC go to $60k; BTC -5% at $66.3K; ETH -7% at $1,920; SOL -9% at $82; XRP +1% at ~$1.37 QNT (+5%), HYPE (+4%) and FLR (+7%) led top movers The HYPE / BTC ratio hit a new ATH as Hyperliquid held strong during the Bitcoin crash JPMorgan said Bitcoin could be “more attractive” than gold over time as a store of value, despite the current rout Bitcoin mining stocks are approaching crisis as BTC trades near the $60K-$80K production cost range; mining difficulty expected to drop 13% Saturday.

A key macro driver behind this move appears to be the recent escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which has pushed broader risk assets into de-risking mode and amplified existing technical fragilities in the ETH market. The combination of macro uncertainty, elevated leverage, and vulnerable chart structure has produced a sharp unwind rather than a controlled pullback. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH has broken down from the prior ascending structure that extended from the late-2025 lows and has failed to break above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are now both located above the $3,000 mark. This price behavior has confirmed a transition from corrective sideways action into a clear downside trend. The price has also broken below the first major demand band around the $2,200-$2,000 area, which coincides with a prior consolidation base and the origin of the last strong impulsive advance. Daily RSI has also fallen into deeply oversold territory in the low 20s, indicating stretched short-term conditions. However, as long as the market remains capped below the broken moving averages and former support around $2,200, the broader structure continues to point toward a bear-market rally at best rather than a confirmed reversal. ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights the velocity of the current sell-off, with ETH cascading lower from the previously defended $2,800–$2,900 support and barely pausing on intermediate levels. The market is now trying to stabilize around the $1,850–$1,900 range, and a mild bullish divergence is emerging on the 4-hour RSI, where momentum has begun to print higher lows despite marginally lower price lows. This configuration often signals that forced selling pressure is easing and that a short-term relief bounce or sideways consolidation may follow. Immediate resistance now sits in the $2,100–$2,200 area, with a stronger supply zone at $2,800. Any rebound that stalls below these bands would keep the intraday trend firmly bearish, while a clean breakdown below the recent $1,800 low would pave the way toward the deeper demand zone at $1,500. Sentiment Analysis On the derivatives side, open interest across Ethereum futures has collapsed from elevated levels above 30 billion USD to nearly a third that size, tracking the price decline and signaling a large-scale liquidation cascade rather than an orderly reduction in positioning. This sharp contraction in open interest indicates that a significant portion of leveraged longs has been forced out of the market, with margin calls and auto-deleveraging accelerating the downside once key support levels failed. While such events are painful in the short term, they also tend to cleanse excess leverage from the system, leaving a lighter positioning backdrop where spot flows and fresh capital, rather than crowded derivatives exposure, can play a larger role in setting the next directional move.

The firm sold about $17 million worth of Coinbase shares and used nearly the same amount to buy stock in digital asset platform Bullish, signaling a strategy change during market weakness. Coinbase (COIN) shares have fallen heavily in recent weeks, dropping more than 40% over the past month and hitting multi-month lows. As prices continued to weaken, ARK Invest sold 119,236 shares of Coinbase, worth around $17.4 million in a single trade session. ARK had mostly been buying Coinbase on dips and had not sold shares for many months. In fact, just days before this sale, the firm had added a small number of Coinbase shares, continuing its earlier buy-the-dip pattern. 🌐 💹 Crypto Update: Cathie Wood’s ARK dumps $17M in Coinbase stock as shares fall 37% YTD Girl, Cathie Wood finally getting real about Coinbase's struggles? Smart move, 'cause that YTD drop is no joke and sometimes you just gotta protect your portfolio. pic.twitter.com/S5nxLUsLbh — Jessica (@koynlabs) February 6, 2026 The quick switch from buyer to seller suggests a short-term defensive move rather than a full exit. Instead of holding cash, ARK quickly moved the money into another crypto company. The firm bought about $17.8 million worth of shares in Bullish , an institutional-focused crypto trading platform listed on the NYSE in 2025. Since its listing, Bullish stock has struggled and is down more than 60%, while the company reported a Q4 net loss of $563.6 million on a GAAP basis. ARK appears to see value at these lower prices and is increasing its exposure. This shift shows that ARK is not leaving crypto, but rotating investments toward firms it believes have better growth potential. ARK Still Holds Large Coinbase Position Even after this sale, ARK remains one of the major investors in Coinbase. Across its main ETFs, the firm still owns about $312 million worth of COIN shares. The shift comes during a difficult time for crypto markets. Bitcoin recently dropped near $60,000, and trading volumes on exchanges have slowed. As a result, Coinbase stock has faced strong selling pressure, currently trading around $146 Trust with CoinPedia: CoinPedia has been delivering accurate and timely cryptocurrency and blockchain updates since 2017.

DOGE’s price crash comes amid a market-wide correction, with Bitcoin (BTC) dipping below $62,000 earlier today, Feb. 6, 2026. According to CoinGecko data, DOGE has fallen 10.6% in the last 24 hours , 19.5% in the last week, 27.4% in the 14-day charts, and 38.6% over the previous month. The low prices could be a good entry point to make big returns in the future. Moreover, Elon Musk as said he would put a Dogecoin on the moon next year, which could substantially boost the memecoin’s price. Source: CoinGecko Buy Dogecoin Now For Big Gains After Elon Musk’s Moon Mission? Source: Pixabay Elon Musk is one of the biggest Dogecoin (DOGE) supporters. He has been very vocal about his admiration of DOGE’s unserious nature. Recently, Musk said that he would put an actual Dogecoin (DOGE) on the moon sometime next year. The move could lead to a massive rally for the memecoin. Buying DOGE at current prices could lead to big gains when Musk does fulfill his Dogecoin to the moon promise. Additionally, there is also a high chance that Musk will enable Dogecoin (DOGE) payments for X’s payment feature. While there has been no official word on the development, given Musk’s previous DOGE-related actions, such as allowing clients to buy Tesla and SpaceX merchandise using the memecoin, there is a high probability X will include DOGE in its payment platform. Also Read: Dogecoin Accumulation Mirrors 2021 Setup, Musk Is Part of It However, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price movements are currently following the larger market trend. Bitcoin’s (BTC) plummet to sub-$62,000 levels has led to a substantial dip in investor sentiment. DOGE may not rebound until the larger market shows some sign of a recovery. We are in bear territory right now, and DOGE’s price could see further dips in the coming days.1c:T400,Dogecoin has dropped below 10 cents for the first time since September 2024, amid a market-wide correction that has also seen Bitcoin fall below $62,000. The memecoin has experienced significant losses across various time frames, with declines of 10.6% in the last 24 hours, 19.5% in the past week, 27.4% over 14 days, and 38.6% in the previous month. Despite these losses, the current low prices might present a buying opportunity for investors anticipating future gains.

Elon Musk's influence remains a key factor for Dogecoin's potential price movement. He recently announced plans to put a physical Dogecoin on the moon next year, which could trigger a substantial rally for the memecoin. Additionally, there's speculation that Musk might enable Dogecoin payments for X's payment feature. However, the cryptocurrency's price is currently following broader market trends, and recovery may depend on an improvement in the overall market sentiment, which is currently in bear territory with potential for further declines.1d:T178d,Crypto markets extended their downside momentum on Friday as selling pressure intensified across both majors and altcoins. Bitcoin fell nearly 9% on the day, briefly touching the $65,000 level, while Ethereum slid below $2,000. The weakness quickly spilled into the broader market, pushing several large-cap and mid-cap altcoins into double-digit losses. This phase of the altcoin crash did not unfold gradually. Instead, price action accelerated once key intraday supports failed, triggering forced liquidations across derivatives markets. Liquidity thinned rapidly, bids pulled back, and volatility expanded in a way typically seen during late-stage risk unwinds rather than the start of fresh bearish trends. With sentiment deteriorating sharply and leverage exiting the system, the market now faces a critical question: Is this the exhaustion phase of the selloff, or merely another step lower? Liquidations Data Shows Capitulation Spreading Beyond Bitcoin The scale of forced selling offers a clearer view of the current altcoin crash. According to derivatives data, total liquidations crossed $2.59 billion over the past 24 hours, marking one of the largest single-day wipeouts in recent months. Bitcoin led the move with $1.34 billion in liquidations , reflecting the cascade triggered once price broke below the $67,000 zone. Ethereum followed with $562 million, while altcoins collectively absorbed more than $1.1 billion in liquidations. Solana alone saw close to $187 million, with the remainder spread across high-beta Layer-1s, DeFi tokens, and speculative mid-caps. This distribution matters. In earlier corrections, Bitcoin typically carried the majority of leverage risk. During this altcoin crash, forced selling extended far deeper into the market, confirming that speculative positioning had built up aggressively beyond BTC. Once prices turned, leverage exited quickly, accelerating downside momentum. Historically, liquidation-heavy sessions of this magnitude tend to reset market structure by flushing excess risk rather than marking the start of prolonged downside trends. Extreme Fear Readings Reflect Late-Stage Panic Conditions Market sentiment data reinforces the view that the current altcoin crash is driven by fear rather than complacency. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 5, placing sentiment firmly in “Extreme Fear” territory. Readings below 10 have appeared only a handful of times across past cycles, including 2018, March 2020, and late 2022. In each instance, such levels reflected emotional capitulation rather than early-stage bearish conviction. While prices did not reverse immediately in every case, downside momentum typically slowed as panic peaked. Altcoin Crash Mirrors Historical Pre-Rotation Phases Despite the severity of the ongoing altcoin crash, long-term structure paints a more nuanced picture. Historical market-cap trends show that altcoin cycles often experience deep compression phases before meaningful rotation begins. In 2017, 2021, and following the 2022 bear market, altcoins endured extended periods of underperformance marked by repeated breakdown fears, declining relative strength, and sharp monthly selloffs. These phases typically preceded strong upside expansions once capital rotation resumed. Current charts reflect a similar pattern. Altcoin market capitalization remains locked in a long-term consolidation range, with downside moves repeatedly attracting demand near historical support zones. While this does not confirm an immediate altcoin season, it suggests the present altcoin crash resembles structural compression rather than outright collapse. Notably, these transitions have historically occurred during periods of extreme fear conditions that closely mirror the current environment. Final Thoughts The altcoin crash appears driven more by liquidation pressure than fresh selling. With sentiment near extreme fear and leverage largely flushed, downside momentum may be slowing. Volatility can persist, but the data suggests the market is closer to stabilization than collapse. Caution remains key, yet conditions for a gradual base may be forming. FAQs Why is the crypto market crashing today? Crypto prices fell as key supports broke, triggering mass liquidations. High leverage, thin liquidity, and panic selling accelerated losses across coins. Is this crypto crash a sign of a new bear market? Not necessarily. Data suggests forced liquidations drove the drop, which often marks late-stage selloffs rather than the start of long bear markets. What do high crypto liquidations mean for prices? Large liquidations usually flush excess leverage. This can reduce selling pressure and help prices stabilize once panic-driven trades are cleared. Should investors buy altcoins during a crash? Crashes can create long-term opportunities, but timing is risky. Many investors wait for volatility to cool and price action to stabilize.

In a post on X, Joe McCann of Asymmetric noted that the move was a -5.65σ (standard deviation) using the 200-day lookback period. Statistically, such an outcome qualifies as a ‘Black Swan’ event, rare and improbable. Yet, since Bitcoin’s inception, it has occurred four times . This underscores how ‘Black Swan’ events are relatively frequent in crypto and highlights the scale of the latest price crash. In a post on X , analyst Axel Adler Jr noted that BTC was trading well below its realized price at $79.1k. AMBCrypto reported that the leading crypto asset had made a 14-month low due to an increasingly strong correlation with U.S. tech stocks . According to digital asset manager Grayscale, the sell-off was also driven by the CLARITY Act’s slow momentum. Bitcoin institutional selling pressure is rising Analyst Darkfost pointed out that the Coinbase Premium gap was at its most negative point in 2026. It was especially compelling since this was the volume-weighted version, which helps reduce noise. The negative gap means that the Bitcoin price on Coinbase is at a discount compared to the price on Binance. In other words, it implied heavy selling pressure from large U.S. investors. The scenario is challenging and highly uncertain for long-term investors as well as traders. The weekly low at $74.5k has been smashed aside. Although the current week’s trading has not closed, its drop to $60k laid open the possibility of a much deeper retracement. Source: BTC/USD on TradingView Trader Ibrahim made an interesting case for a potential Bitcoin bottom. In a post on CryptoQuant Insights , the trader noted that the previous cycle’s highest monthly close tended to be the bear market bottom. If that is the case once again, the $55k-$60k area could be the current bear market’s bottom. In the past, the approach of these monthly support zones has been slower than the breakneck bearish pace Bitcoin has set since November 2025. Long-term investors may have weeks and months before they witness the true market bottom. As such, they need not be in any hurry to buy the market pain. Final Thoughts The Bitcoin price drop was a highly improbable event, representing a -5.65σ move in the 200-day lookback period. It is unclear if prices will fall further, but traders and investors should operate under the assumption that the market bottom is not yet in.

Hodler net position fell 17% showing reduced buying conviction. Solana’s price has staged a sharp rebound after one of its steepest declines. After breaking down from its descending channel on February 4, SOL plunged nearly 30% to around $67. Since then, the token has recovered more than 15%, climbing back toward the $78 region. At first glance, the bounce looks encouraging. However, on-chain data suggests that the rebound may be driven by short-term speculation rather than strong long-term demand. Historical patterns show that similar recoveries often fade quickly when speculative money comes in strongly. Current metrics indicate that Solana may still be vulnerable to another leg lower if one key level isn’t reclaimed. Sponsored Sponsored Descending Channel Breakdown Triggered the 30% Drop Solana’s sell-off accelerated after the price decisively broke the lower trendline of its descending channel on February 4, in line with an earlier SOL price analysis. Once the lower trendline support failed, SOL quickly moved toward its projected downside target near $67, completing a decline of nearly 30% from recent highs. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . Solana Breakdown Target Hit: TradingView After reaching the $67 zone, buyers stepped in and triggered a rebound toward $78. While this move represents a recovery of more than 15%, the broader technical structure has not improved. Similar rebounds in past cycles have often occurred after major dips, but they rarely marked durable reversals unless supported by strong accumulation. So far, the current bounce lacks that confirmation as the buyer persona is now under the scanner. Short-Term Buyers Lead the Rebound as Long-Term Holders Reduce Exposure On-chain data shows that Solana’s rebound is being driven mainly by short-term holders rather than long-term investors. According to the HODL waves metric, which separates wallets by time held, the one-day to one-week cohort increased its share of supply from 4.49% to 6.08% between February 4 and February 6. Sponsored Sponsored This represents a sharp rise in speculative participation over a short period. Historically, this group tends to sell quickly during periods of weakness, making their buying activity unreliable as a foundation for sustained rallies. Speculative Money Enters: Glassnode A similar pattern appeared in late January. On January 27, short-term holders controlled around 5.26% of the supply. By January 31, their share had dropped to 4.38% as they sold into weakness. During that period, Solana’s price fell from around $127 to $105, a roughly 17% decline. Historical Price Relevance: Glassnode This behavior highlights how quickly short-term buyers can exit when momentum fades. With their current share rising again, the recent rebound risks unraveling if selling pressure returns. Sponsored Sponsored At the same time, long-term holders continue to reduce exposure. The Hodler net position change metric, which tracks long-term investor holdings, has declined from approximately 2.87 million SOL on February 3 to around 2.37 million SOL by February 5. A 17% dip in two days, amid the dip. Hodlers Not Buying More: Glassnode This shows that investors holding for more than 155 days are still distributing rather than accumulating. When short-term buyers are increasing exposure while long-term holders are exiting, it usually signals weak market conditions. This imbalance suggests that conviction remains weak and that the rebound is not being supported by strong capital inflows. Solana Price Levels Show Why the Recovery Remains Unproven Solana’s price structure reflects the weakness seen in on-chain data. Sponsored Sponsored The first key level to watch is $93. Reclaiming this zone would require another move of nearly 19% from current levels and would signal a meaningful improvement in market structure and even Hodler confidence. Without a sustained break above this level, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure. Above $93, stronger resistance sits near $105 and $121, where previous breakdowns occurred. These zones would need to be reclaimed before a medium-term recovery could be confirmed. On the downside, the $67 region remains critical support. This level marked the recent cycle low. A sustained break below $67 would expose the next downside target near $59. Solana Price Analysis: TradingView If $59 fails, Solana could enter a deeper corrective phase , bringing lower support zones into play. Such a move would likely be accompanied by further selling from short-term holders and continued distribution from long-term investors. Until Solana reclaims $93 while long-term accumulation returns and speculative activity cools, the rebound remains technically and structurally weak. Under current conditions, price bounces are still vulnerable to rapid reversals.

It is Feb. 6, Friday, and the crypto market is dealing with the implications of yesterday's $2.6 billion bloodbath; that is how much, according to CoinGlass, was liquidated in derivatives on crypto yesterday. On today's agenda, though, is how Grayscale just dumped XRP worth $1.15 million in one day as the price plummeted 26%. Cardano Creator Hoskinson claims to have lost over $3 billion, yet he refuses to cash out. Meanwhile, the ADA charts indicate an 80% drop straight to $0.053. Finally, Binance pulled the plug on 20 spot pairs right after $2.6 billion in liquidations rocked the market. Bitcoin bounced back up to $60,000, but it still looks doomed, down 48% from its October peak. HOT Stories There are no catalysts or safety nets — just "blood in the streets," as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said. Altcoins are being wiped out, miners' reserves and ETFs have become weapons, and "crypto winter" is no longer a nightmare scenario; it is the current environment. TL;DR Grayscale was revealed as one of the biggest XRP ETF sellers amid a -26% daily price crash. Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson says he lost over $3 billion in crypto, ADA eyes $0.053. Binance cuts 20 spot pairs after a $2.6 billion liquidation storm as Bitcoin dips to $60,000s. No, secret Ripple founder is not dumping XRP: Here's who is If you were one of those blaming Ripple insiders for the XRP crash, data just killed that theory. On Feb. 5, XRP lost over 26% in a single trading day — its worst 24-hour sell-off since mid-2022. Rumors swirled that Ripple wallets might be dumping again. But ETF data exposes the real reason. According to SoSoValue’s ETF flows, Grayscale’s GXRP spot ETF saw a net outflow of 974,110 XRP yesterday, equivalent to over $1.15 million, and it was the only XRP ETF with any outflows at all. Franklin’s XRPZ and Canary’s XRPC posted $1.63 million and $503,000 in daily net inflows, respectively. That points to concentrated dumping from Grayscale holders, not Ripple staff or "secret" founders. Source: SoSoValue Even with $66.8 million in total XRP spot ETF trading activity on the day, only one player was selling big, and it was Grayscale. As of Feb. 6, the total XRP spot ETF net inflow remains positive at $1.21 billion, with net assets hovering around $1.07 billion. But if Grayscale’s sell-off is extending, it risks sparking another confidence crisis for XRP. You Might Also Like Cardano creator admits $3 billion losses as ADA price eyes 80% collapse Charles Hoskinson’s livestream confession on X from Tokyo hit differently. The Cardano founder publicly admitted to losing over $3 billion in personal crypto holdings, calling it an unrealized loss but refusing to sell. ADA crashed over 10% on Thursday, slipping under $0.27, and is now teetering on critical weekly supports. “It’d have been real easy to cash out… Do you think I honestly care if I lose it all?” - Charles Hoskinson on X That stoicism did not stop ADA from bleeding. According to analyst Ali Martinez , the ADA weekly chart now targets $0.249 as immediate support, with $0.115 and even $0.053 as potential capitulation zones. Cardano token is already down over 75% from its 2025 peak, and an 80% drawdown scenario is now just a 15% drop away. Source: Ali Martinez Hoskinson’s comments came as a morale boost to the community, but the price chart tells a more ruthless story. Cardano developers may be building, but ADA holders are exiting. If $0.249 fails to hold, ADA may enter a brutal illiquidity pocket, where double-digit drawdowns can happen intraday. That puts $0.115 as a medium-term bear target unless market sentiment shifts somehow. 20 pairs set to be delisted by Binance after $2.6 billion liquidation tsunami Thursday’s liquidation carnage erased $2.6 billion in derivatives across the crypto market, and the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance, is already slashing exposure. The exchange announced the delisting of 20 spot pairs, citing poor liquidity and risk concentration. Affected pairs include: AUDIO/BTC, BB/FDUSD, BERA/FDUSD, EIGEN/BTC, FIDA/BTC, HEI/BTC, IOTX/ETH, KERNEL/FDUSD, MANTA/BTC, MTL/BTC, NEAR/FDUSD, PEOPLE/FDUSD, RENDER/FDUSD, RONIN/BTC, SAPIEN/BNB, SCR/BTC, S/ETH, S/FDUSD, SUSHI/BTC and VANA/FDUSD.

Several of the affected pairs were down 30-70% during peak liquidation windows. Binance’s risk desk appears to be proactively pruning volatility to avoid cascading failures — especially with BTC hovering just 10% above $66,000 in what may be a "dead cat bounce." Crypto market outlook: XRP, BTC, ADA price update As we enter the second week of February, most major assets face critical weekly closes. XRP ETF flows remain net positive, but the Grayscale exit is a red flag. ADA is nearing chart oblivion, and Hoskinson’s morale boost will not change price gravity. Binance’s mass delisting signals that de-risking is not done yet. Expect more forced sellers, painful bounces and wild swings. Focus on BTC’s ability to hold $66,000 into the weekend. If that breaks, prepare for the $50,000s or worse. Key levels to watch: Bitcoin (BTC): Holding $66,000 keeps hope alive; lose it, and next stops are $60,000, then $52,000, $47,300 and finally $42,000. XRP: Under $1.3 risks $1 break; $0.33 follows fast. Cardano (ADA): Teeters at $0.273, with $0.249 as last real support before collapsing toward $0.115 and then $0.053.

The retracement unfolded alongside a broader crypto market downturn over the past two weeks, CoinGecko data shows . On Jan. 23, total crypto market capitalization stood at about $3.1 trillion, before falling to $2.2 trillion on Friday. Major assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) slid from around $89,000 to about $65,000, while Ether ( ETH ) fell from $3,000 to near $1,800 throughout the same time frame. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the top two networks for NFTs in terms of 30-day trading volume, according NFT data aggregator CryptoSlam. The NFT market cap drop follows several high-profile closures and exits, highlighting the sector’s continued contraction. Total NFT market cap chart. Source: CoinGecko Rising supply collides with falling demand The market reset has been compounded by a growing imbalance between NFT supply and buyer demand. As reported by Cointelegraph on Dec. 31, total NFT supply continued to expand even as sales and prices declined, pushing the sector into a high-volume, low-price structure. CryptoSlam data showed that the number of NFTs in circulation rose to nearly 1.3 billion in 2025, up by 25% compared to 2024. Total NFT sales fell 37% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, while average sale prices slipped below $100. The divergence suggests that while minting became cheaper and barriers to issuance fell, buyer participation and spending failed to keep up.

Updated Feb 6, 2026, 1:05 p.m. Published Feb 6, 2026, 12:54 p.m. Ripple and XRPL contributors have outlined a growing set of “institutional DeFi” building blocks on the XRP Ledger that aim to make the network viable for regulated financial activity, per a Thursday blog. XRP’s utility as a settlement and bridge asset is being highlighted as central to that infrastructure, with usecases ranging from from forex and stablecoin rails to tokenized collateral and native lending markets. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The latest roadmap emphasizes features already live — such as multi-purpose token standards (MPT), permissioned domains with compliance tooling, credential-backed access and batch transactions — alongside upcoming releases that extend XRPL into credit markets and privacy-preserving workflows. Unlike many smart contract chains that bolt on compliance after the fact, XRPL’s approach has been to embed identity and control primitives at the protocol layer. Permissioned domains and credentials allow markets to gate participation by verified entities, a requirement institutions often cite as a barrier to onchain integration. On the payments and FX side, XRP’s role as an auto-bridge between assets continues to be cited as a demand driver, with stablecoin corridors and remittance flows adding to onchain volume and fee activity. Token escrows and object reserves denominated in XRP further tie network usage back to the native asset. Looking ahead, the introduction of XLS-65/66 — the XRPL lending protocol — is slated to offer pooled and underwritten credit on ledger without entirely offloading risk logic onchain. Single asset vaults, fixed-term lending and optional permissioning tools are designed to feel familiar to institutional risk managers while operating in an onchain settlement context. Privacy features like confidential transfers for MPTs, arriving in the first quarter, aim to satisfy enterprise and regulatory expectations around transaction-level anonymity and controlled disclosure. Critics have long pointed to XRPL’s lack of EVM-style programmability as a hindrance. The new EVM sidechain — bridged via the Axelar network — is meant to address this by letting Solidity developers tap into XRPL liquidity and identity features while accessing familiar tooling. XRP prices are down 22% over the past seven days, in line with a broader market drop.24:Tec9,XRP’s sharp 17% fall did not happen because of bad news from Ripple. The real reason was a broader crypto market crash. Bitcoin price fell quickly, and Ethereum dropped below the important $2,000 level. Investors across the market rushed to sell and cut their risk. XRP usually moves faster than most large cryptocurrencies. So when the market turned negative, XRP fell harder and faster than others. Once prices started dropping, panic selling kicked in. More sellers entered the market, pushing the price down even further in a short time. Heavy Liquidations Triggered the XRP Sell-Off The biggest reason behind the XRP price drop was forced liquidations. In the last 24 hours alone, nearly $46 million worth of XRP positions were closed automatically. Most of these were traders who had bet on XRP prices going higher. When XRP fell below the key level near $1.44, many of these trades were shut down by exchanges. This added more selling pressure and caused prices to fall even faster. In markets with high borrowing and leverage, once selling starts, prices often keep falling until the most risky positions are cleared. Ripple’s Positive News Couldn’t Save XRP Price This drop confused many investors because Ripple recently secured important regulatory approvals in Europe, including licenses in the UK and Luxembourg. Normally, such news would help XRP prices. However, during a market-wide selloff, investors focus more on fear and safety than long-term progress. Right now, XRP is moving based on short-term market emotions rather than Ripple’s business growth. Key XRP Support Levels to Watch Next The $1.00 price level is now the most important support for XRP. If the crypto market stays weak, a move toward this level would not be surprising. XRP could briefly dip below $1.00 if panic selling returns, but a long-term fall below this level would likely need another major wave of selling across the market. Meanwhile, analyst Bill Morgan’s comment about XRP possibly dropping below USDC in market value highlights how fragile investor confidence remains. Why XRP Recovery Is Still Possible Despite the sharp fall, large investors are not panicking. XRP ETFs are still seeing money flow in, even during the price drop. This is very different from Bitcoin ETFs, which have faced strong outflows. XRP’s recovery will largely depend on whether Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilize. If the overall market calms down and price swings slow, XRP could bounce back faster than many expect. With better regulation, steady interest from institutions, and lower risky trading activity, this drop may turn out to be a short-term reset rather than a long-term downtrend.

Similar downturns in the past have usually been accompanied by falling participation and capital exiting the space. This time, however, the setup looks different. Instead of drying up, capital has surged, with stablecoin inflows doubling even as prices decline. This points to traders staying engaged and waiting on the sidelines rather than rushing to exit, likely positioning for a potential entry near market lows. The key question now is whether the Bitcoin (BTC) price has already found a bottom or if the market still needs to endure further downside before a more durable recovery can take shape. Stablecoin Inflow Doubles to OVer $102 Billion The Weekly stablecoin exchange inflows have witnessed a massive increase, nearly doubling, highlighting a sharp increase in funds moving into exchanges during the sell-off. The rise in the stablecoin inflow comes at a time when Bitcoin and major altcoins remain under pressure, weighed down by heavy liquidations and weakening short-term market structure. Source: X The data from CryptoQuant shows a major spike in inflows reaching $102 billion, well above the 90-day average of around $89 billion. This increase indicates a rapid rise in stablecoins being transferred to exchanges rather than withdrawn. Large inflows during a sell-off usually indicate that traders are preparing for potential accumulation rather than exiting the market. In simple terms, they are waiting for the markets to bottom. When Does the Crypto Market Typically Bottom? Historical Bitcoin bear markets show a clear pattern in drawdowns. In past cycles—2011, 2013–15, 2017–18, and 2021–22—market bottoms have usually formed after Bitcoin recorded deep peak-to-trough losses ranging between 60% and 80%. The chart highlights that earlier corrections rarely ended at shallow pullbacks. Instead, price tended to stabilize only after prolonged drawdowns, accompanied by sustained fear, declining participation, and extended consolidation phases. In the 2021–22 cycle, for example, Bitcoin bottomed only after the drawdown pushed well beyond 70%, followed by several months of sideways movement. Source: X In the current cycle, the drawdown remains shallower compared to prior bear-market bottoms, suggesting the market may still be in a price-discovery and positioning phase rather than a confirmed bottoming process. Historically, bottoms have formed not at the first sharp drop, but after volatility compresses and drawdowns stop making new lows. This comparison suggests that while capital positioning is increasing, time and further stabilization, rather than a single event, have typically been required before durable market bottoms emerge. The Bottom Line: What to Watch Next? The data suggests the market is not in panic exit mode, but it may also not be done correcting. More than $350 billion has already been erased from total crypto market capitalization, yet stablecoin inflows have doubled to around $102 billion, showing capital is waiting rather than leaving. Historically, Bitcoin bear-market bottoms have formed after 60%–80% drawdowns. From the recent cycle high, BTC is currently down roughly 35%–45%, which places the market short of typical historical lows. Based on past drawdowns, a probable downside zone for the Bitcoin price lies between $48,000 and $42,000, where long-term demand has previously emerged. For the broader crypto market, a comparable move would imply total market capitalization falling toward the $1.6 trillion–$1.4 trillion range, down from recent highs near $2.3 trillion. In short, capital appears ready, but history suggests price may still need to probe lower levels or consolidate longerbefore a durable bottom is confirmed.

Sometimes, it’s about putting systems in place to make sure your content reaches its audience, even when Google threatens to take that traffic away. For BeInCrypto founder Alena Afanaseva, long-term thinking beats short-term hacks. In today’s fast-changing media landscape, sustainability comes from strategy. At BeInCrypto, that means staying committed to quality, credibility, and trust, even as algorithms shift. Speaking during a live podcast at Binance Blockchain Week, Alena shared insights on branding, media leadership, and the evolving relationship between AI, Google, and crypto journalism. Watch the full podcast interview here to hear Alena’s complete perspective. Sponsored Sponsored With 20+ years in finance, analytics, and digital media, she emphasized one key principle: Long-term integrity outweighs short-term growth hacks and that alone should be the defining factor for media survival today. Personal Branding Starts from the Core, Not Visibility Alena’s advice for founders is simple: start from the inside. Chasing virality or outsourcing your voice before understanding who you are rarely works. Authenticity is the foundation. Key takeaways: Identify your true strengths (public speaking, writing, analytical thinking) so your personal brand reflects what you genuinely excel at. Build your brand around those strengths to stay authentic. Work with professionals to amplify your voice, not replace it, keeping your brand true to you. “If there is something fake in between, it’s not going to work.” Visibility should follow the creation of something real, not precede it. Alena began in financial journalism and market analysis, publicly commenting on Bitcoin as early as 2014. Transitioning to crypto meant navigating uncharted territory: Sponsored Sponsored Early crypto markets were volatile, unstructured, and hype-driven. Traditional analysis methods didn’t apply. The ecosystem was narrow, mostly clustered with enthusiasts, hype, and heavy media influence. “Nothing worked for digital assets at that time,” Alena notes. Building BeInCrypto required creating a network from scratch and committing to disciplined, long-term strategies, even when short-term gains tempted others. Why BeInCrypto Stayed Stable While Others Lost Traffic Our platform focused on trust and insight, not just clicks, a philosophy that was put to the test during the memecoin boom. While many publishers chased hype and promoted low-quality projects, BeInCrypto: Limited press releases and reinforced internal editorial rules. Prioritized content quality, editorial integrity , and a clear separation between commercial interests and newsroom work. “We said no to millions of dollars because we realized it would kill the website long-term,” Alena explains. Sponsored Sponsored This long-term focus kept BeInCrypto stable while many crypto media outlets lost traffic chasing spikes or gaming SEO. Understanding the Google Shift Recent Google algorithm changes reinforced this strategy. According to Alena: Updates are frequent and unpredictable AI-generated content faces greater scrutiny Evergreen listicles and reviews are increasingly replaced by Google AI overviews. Mislabeling press releases, embedding affiliate links in editorial content, or lowering advertiser quality sends strong negative signals “AI isn’t the enemy; bad strategy is.” At BeInCrypto, AI accelerates research and drafting without compromising quality, boosting productivity while maintaining trust. Sponsored Sponsored AI as an Editorial Tool, Not a Threat Contrary to popular belief, AI isn’t killing the media. At BeInCrypto, AI tools: Support journalists with research and drafting Reduce cost per article Maintain human oversight to safeguard quality Visibility in ChatGPT and Other AI Tools Requires Trust As AI-powered search and discovery continues to grow, traditional PR tactics such as mass press release distribution, low-authority backlinks, and inflated media coverage no longer work. To be visible in ChatGPT or other LLMs, brands must focus on: Authority and credibility Trusted media mentions Consistent, high-quality content Long-term partnerships with reputable outlets One meaningful mention from a credible source now outweighs hundreds of low-quality placements. Founder Values Shape Company Culture With 150 people across 50+ countries, BeInCrypto emphasizes culture, structure, and shared values.

She argued that stability in the volatile crypto market comes from authentic core values and refusing to compromise editorial quality for quick profits. While many competitors chased hype during the memecoin boom, BeInCrypto rejected millions of dollars in low-quality advertising to maintain audience trust and avoid algorithmic penalties.

Afanaseva also addressed the impact of Google’s algorithm updates and the rise of AI, stating that AI is a tool to boost productivity rather than a replacement for human oversight. She believes that visibility in AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT depends on building authority and credibility rather than mass PR distribution. Ultimately, she highlighted that a company culture focused on shared values and analytical thinking is essential for long-term survival in the crypto media landscape.29:Tefe,Two of Ethereum’s most senior figures just disagreed publicly on how the protocol should scale, and the conversation is worth paying attention to. Ethereum Foundation Co-Executive Director Tomasz Stańczak suggested that Ethereum should drop its built-in statelessness effort at L1 and let L2s handle state scaling instead. He called the current approach too complex and “against the idea of simplicity,” adding that the current design leads to “nothing better than L2s.” Vitalik Buterin responded directly and disagreed. What Did Vitalik Buterin Say About L1 Statelessness? Buterin first corrected how Stańczak framed the issue. He said current proposals are not about “higher-security vs lower-security” state but about “higher-accessibility vs lower-accessibility.” He then laid out a path where Ethereum scales execution by 1000x but state by only 20x. In that setup, creating new storage slots becomes very expensive compared to computation. Apps would need to provide merkle proofs to update virtual state trees instead of using native L1 storage. He noted that privacy protocols already work this way. L2 Dependency Puts User Funds at Risk This is where it matters most. Buterin said that relying too heavily on L2s means more dependency on extra-protocol code. When that code breaks, users lose money, and there is no hard fork to fix it. He was clear: consensus failure followed by a hard fork is “less bad” than people quietly losing funds through broken L2 infrastructure. This lines up with his recent comments where he called most L2s “copypasta EVM chains” and said Ethereum does not need more of them. Have been following reactions to what I said about L2s about 1.5 days ago. One important thing that I believe is: "make yet another EVM chain and add an optimistic bridge to Ethereum with a 1 week delay" is to infra what forking Compound is to governance – something we've done… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 5, 2026 Buterin Floats a UTXO-Style Alternative If the goal is to minimize L1 work, Buterin said he would go with a bare-bones UTXO approach, starting with moving receipts to SSZ for better provability. But he is not locking anything in. “There is no need for us to commit to an exact path this year,” he said , emphasizing that L1-native solutions reduce the code apps depend on for security while protecting “privacy, availability and censorship resistance for users.” Also Read: Vitalik Buterin Wants Ethereum to Survive Without Him, Reveals 7-Step Plan With Ethereum L1 gas limit increases planned for 2026 and Buterin openly questioning the role of L2s, this debate inside the Foundation could shape the protocol’s scaling roadmap going forward.

Readers should conduct further research prior to taking any actions. Learn more › The cryptocurrency market has entered a renewed phase of volatility, with major digital assets including XRP, TRX, and BNB experiencing notable price corrections alongside broader market weakness. The downturn reflects a combination of macroeconomic pressure, reduced speculative activity, and ongoing reassessment of long-term network fundamentals across leading blockchain ecosystems. As prices across multiple Layer 1 platforms decline, market participants are increasingly shifting focus from short-term valuation toward infrastructure resilience, scalability, and real-world utility — areas that continue to shape the long-term trajectory of blockchain adoption. Market Corrections Renew Focus on Network Utility XRP, TRX, and BNB have each played significant roles in powering payments, smart contracts, and exchange-driven ecosystems. However, the recent correction has highlighted a recurring industry theme: sustainable growth depends not only on usage and liquidity, but also on scalable infrastructure capable of supporting increasingly complex applications under peak demand. Across the industry, builders are responding by prioritizing performance optimization, modular architecture, and execution-layer innovation as the next phase of blockchain evolution takes shape. SONAMI Advances Solana’s Layer 2 Ecosystem During Market Downturn Against this backdrop, SONAMI continues to advance its roadmap as a next-generation Layer 2 network designed to expand Solana’s scalability and execution capabilities. While market sentiment remains cautious, SONAMI’s development strategy remains firmly focused on long-term infrastructure development rather than short-term market cycles. By introducing a dedicated Layer 2 execution environment, SONAMI aims to complement Solana’s high-performance Layer 1 architecture while unlocking greater flexibility for developers, enterprises, and application-specific deployments. Layer 2 Infrastructure Emerges as a Cross-Chain Priority The recent pullback across XRP, TRX, and BNB has reinforced a broader industry trend: as blockchain networks scale, Layer 2 solutions are becoming increasingly critical to managing throughput, reducing congestion, and improving user experience. Rather than competing with Layer 1 networks, Layer 2 architectures are evolving as performance amplifiers — enabling networks to support higher volumes, specialized workloads, and institutional-grade applications without compromising core network efficiency. SONAMI applies this approach within the Solana ecosystem, focusing on execution efficiency, modular scalability, and developer-centric infrastructure design. Stage 9 Signals Continued Momentum for SONAMI SONAMI recently announced the official launch of Stage 9 of its development roadmap, marking a key milestone in the project’s progress toward delivering scalable, high-performance Layer 2 infrastructure for Solana. Stage 9 focuses on strengthening SONAMI’s execution capabilities and expanding its modular framework to support a broader range of applications. SONAMI’s Layer 2 architecture is designed to: Increase effective transaction scalability and throughput Reduce congestion during periods of peak network activity Enable faster settlement and improved user experiences Support application-specific environments and enterprise-grade use cases Provide developers with flexible, modular infrastructure options Building Through Volatility Market downturns have historically served as periods of recalibration for the blockchain industry. While price corrections impact short-term sentiment, they often accelerate the development of infrastructure that defines the next growth cycle. With SONAMI continuing to build through the current correction — even as XRP, TRX, and BNB face market pressure — the project is positioning itself to contribute meaningful infrastructure improvements to Solana’s ecosystem. As attention shifts from speculation to scalability and performance, SONAMI’s progress underscores a broader industry movement toward resilient, utility-driven blockchain development designed to endure market cycles and support long-term adoption.

The past few days have been nothing but a massacre for the majority of the leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed to levels last seen in 2024, whereas Ethereum (ETH) tumbled well below $2,000. Interestingly, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has shown notable resilience amid the crisis, with its price soaring by 60% in the past two weeks. In the following lines, we will touch upon these three cryptocurrencies and their latest performance. BTC Bleeds Out The primary cryptocurrency started the year on the right foot and at one point even challenged the $100K milestone. The past few weeks, though, have been brutal, with the price collapsing to as low as $60,000 on February 5. As of press time, BTC trades at approximately $66,400, representing a 20% weekly decline. Pessimism among analysts has since dominated, with many suggesting that bears may simply be stepping in. Ali Martinez recently reminded that since 2015, every time BTC has lost the 100-week simple moving average (SMA), it has failed to reclaim it quickly and continued toward the 200-week SMA. Based on his chart, the asset’s valuation could plunge to $57,600. For their part, PlanB (the anonymous creator of the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model) presented several possible scenarios, including a devastating crash to $25,000. The recent behaviour of the large investors supports the bearish thesis. Santiment’s data shows that whale and shark wallets have been selling BTC over the past few days, while smaller players have increased their exposure. “This combination of key stakeholders selling and retail buying is what historically creates bear cycles. Until there is a sign of clear capitulation from the crowd, smart money will continue to gladly sell off their bags and not have any urgency to buy back in until the crowd has decided to move on from crypto,” the analysis reads. Meanwhile, the popular Fear & Greed Index (which measures the current sentiment of BTC investors) has fallen to 9, the lowest point since the summer of 2022. Extreme fear is a sign that investors are overly worried and may sound alarming, but it can also indicate that the bottom is in.

Analysts Explain Why BTC Just Crashed to $65K and Where the Bottom Lies BTC Fear & Greed Index, Source: alternative.me After all, prominent investors, including Warren Buffett, have advised over the years that the best buying opportunities occur when there’s blood on the streets. The exact words of the Oracle of Omaha are: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Bad Days for ETH The second-largest cryptocurrency has also been significantly affected by the market crisis, with its price briefly falling to a nine-month low of approximately $1,750. Currently, it hovers around $1,900, down 30% over the last seven days. Its negative performance coincides with substantial outflows from spot ETH ETFs, suggesting a decline in institutional investor interest. It also follows news that Vitalik Buterin (one of Ethereum’s co-founders) has sold millions of dollars’ worth of the asset. One popular analyst who touched upon ETH’s recent downtrend is X user Ted. He claimed that the next major support zone for the price is around the April 2025 lows. Recall that at that time, ETH nosedived below $1,400. Ali Martinez argued that the coin historically bottoms when the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) drops under 0.80. On February 5, the metric stood at 0.96, indicating that an additional slump isn’t out of the question. HYPE Stands Its Ground Contrary to BTC, ETH, and countless other cryptocurrencies, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is actually in green territory. Its price has rallied by 60% over the past two weeks, driven by significant developments, including support from Ripple and growing interest in HIP-3 activity amid increased trading volume and open interest. A few days ago, the team behind the decentralized platform revealed that HIP-3 markets reached new all-time highs of $1 billion in open interest and $4.8 billion in 24-hour volume. Analysts like Crypto General and Zach are quite bullish. The former predicted short-term volatility and an eventual spike beyond $100 sometime this year, whereas the latter claimed there are “so many reasons to buy and hold HYPE.” SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer). Tags:2d:T52d,The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant turbulence recently, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) seeing substantial declines. BTC crashed to levels not seen since 2024, dropping to as low as $60,000 on February 5 before recovering slightly to around $66,400, representing a 20% weekly decline. Analysts predict further potential drops, with some suggesting BTC could fall to $57,600 or even $25,000. The market sentiment has reached extreme fear levels, with the Fear & Greed Index falling to 9.

Ethereum has also suffered significantly, falling to a nine-month low of approximately $1,750 and currently hovering around $1,900, down 30% over the last seven days. This decline coincides with substantial outflows from spot ETH ETFs and news that Vitalik Buterin has sold millions of dollars' worth of ETH. Analysts suggest the next major support zone for ETH is around $1,400.

In contrast to the broader market trend, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has shown remarkable resilience, with its price rallying by 60% over the past two weeks. This performance is driven by developments including support from Ripple and growing interest in HIP-3 activity, with markets reaching new all-time highs of $1 billion in open interest and $4.8 billion in 24-hour volume. Some analysts predict HYPE could spike beyond $100 this year.2e:Tcb5,ตลาด cryptocurrency ได้ประสบกับความวุ่นวายอย่างมากเมื่อเร็วๆ นี้ โดย Bitcoin (BTC) และ Ethereum (ETH) ได้เห็นการลดลงอย่างมีนัยสำคัญ BTC ที่ตกลงมาถึงระดับที่ไม่เคยเห็นมาตั้งแต่ปี 2024 โดยลดลงไปถึงระดับต่ำสุด $60,000 ในวันที่ 5 กุมภาพันธ์ก่อนที่จะฟื้นตัวเล็กน้อยมาอยู่ที่ราว $66,400 ซึ่งแสดงถึงการลดลง 20% ในรายสัปดาห์ นักวิเคราะห์คาดการณ์ว่าจะมีการลดลงต่อไปอีก โดยบางคนแนะนำว่า BTC อาจตกลงไปถึง $57,600 หรือแม้กระทั่ง $25,000 ความรู้สึกของตลาดได้ถึงระดับความกลัวอย่างรุนแรง โดยดัชนี Fear & Greed ลดลงมาอยู่ที่ 9

Ethereum ก็ได้รับผลกระทบอย่างหนักเช่นกัน โดยลดลงมาถึงระดับต่ำสุดในรอบ 9 เดือนที่ประมาณ $1,750 และปัจจุบันอยู่ที่ราว $1,900 ซึ่งลดลง 30% ในช่วง 7 วันที่ผ่านมา การลดลงนี้เกิดขึ้นพร้อมกับการไหลออกจาก ETH ETFs อย่างมาก และข่าวที่ว่า Vitalik Buterin ได้ขาย ETH มูลค่าหลายล้านดอลลาร์ นักวิเคราะห์บางคนแนะนำว่าแนวรับที่สำคัญถัดไปสำหรับ ETH อยู่ที่ราว $1,400

ในทางตรงกันข้ามกับแนวโน้มของตลาดโดยรวม Hyperliquid (HYPE) ได้แสดงความเด็ดขาดอย่างน่าทึ่ง โดยราคาได้พุ่งสูงขึ้น 60% ในช่วงสองสัปดาห์ที่ผ่านมา ประสิทธิภาพนี้ได้รับแรงผลักดันจากการพัฒนา รวมถึงการสนับสนุนจาก Ripple และความสนใจที่เพิ่มขึ้นในกิจกรรม HIP-3 โดยตลาดได้สร้างสถิติสูงสุดใหม่ที่ $1 พันล้านใน open interest และ $4.8 พันล้านในปริมาณการซื้อขายใน 24 ชั่วโมง นักวิเคราะห์บางคนคาดการณ์ว่า HYPE อาจพุ่งขึ้นเกิน $100 ในปีนี้2f:T9d7,BeInCrypto has been recognized as a leader in digital financial journalism, winning ‘Best Website: Economics & Finance’ at the 2025 Brazil Publisher Awards (BPA).

The deal gives Tether around a 12% ownership stake in the precious metals company and strengthens its long-term focus on real-world assets and blockchain-based finance. The investment will happen in two stages. Tether will first buy $125 million worth of Gold.com shares, followed by an additional $25 million, subject to regulatory approval. As part of the agreement, Tether will also be able to appoint a board member, giving it a say in Gold.com’s future plans. Tether Gold and Physical Bullion: Connecting Digital and Real Assets A key part of this partnership is the deeper integration of Tether Gold (XAU₮) into Gold.com’s platform. XAU₮ is a gold-backed digital token, with each token supported 1:1 by physical gold stored in secure vaults. This collaboration could allow users to buy physical gold using digital assets, including USDT and XAU₮. By combining Gold.com’s bullion operations with Tether’s global stablecoin network, the companies aim to create a single platform linking traditional gold markets with crypto-based payments. Gold Price Rally Boosts Demand for Gold-Backed Stablecoins The timing of the deal comes as gold prices hit record highs, crossing the $5,000 per ounce level. Alongside this rally, interest in gold-backed stablecoins has surged. Over the past year, the market for gold-backed digital assets has grown from $1.3 billion to $5.5 billion. Tether Gold leads the sector, holding more than half of the total market value. Tether itself reportedly owns around 140 tonnes of physical gold, worth over $23 billion, strengthening its role in hard-asset-backed digital finance. How Tether’s Investment Helps Gold.com Go Digital Founded in 1965, Gold.com operates several well-known precious metals brands, including JMBullion, Monex Precious Metals, GovMint, and Stack’s Bowers Galleries. These platforms have long focused on physical bullion sales and collectibles. With Tether’s backing, Gold.com plans to expand into digital gold products, stablecoins, and possibly gold leasing and tokenized assets. Company leaders say the partnership supports their goal of becoming a full-service precious metals platform, serving both traditional investors and crypto users. Tether’s Growing Focus on Real-World Assets This investment fits into Tether’s broader diversification strategy. The company reported $10 billion in net profit in 2025 and revealed excess reserves of more than $6.3 billion. Beyond USDT, Tether has been investing in Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence, decentralized communications, and now precious metals. The Gold.com deal highlights Tether’s push to position tokenized gold as a modern store of value, blending the stability of physical gold with the speed and flexibility of digital finance.

On Feb. 11 and 12, XRP holders , builders, institutions and Ripple leaders will come together for XRP Community Day 2026, a global, virtual event that will celebrate XRP's increasing utility, adoption and real-world impact, as well as the broader XRPL ecosystem. Three live X Spaces are set to be hosted by Ripple , covering EMEA, the Americas and APAC regions. Feb. 11 is specifically for EMEA and the Americas, while Feb. 12 will cover the APAC region. In a recent tweet, RippleX shares what to expect at a key segment of the event. The "XRP Features: What’s Live and What’s Next" segment of the event will feature Ayo Akinyele, Head of Engineering at RippleX; Jasmine Cooper, RippleX Head of Product; and RippleX Engineer Mayukha Vadari, with XRP community members Vet and Krippenreiter as moderators. HOT Stories The segment will share the latest updates on the XRP Ledger and what’s coming next for XRP. Speakers will walk through the progress made on the XRP Ledger across programmability, privacy, compliance and the native lending protocol, and how these changes support DeFi. The focus of the discussion will be on how these features allow real applications by users, shedding light on how the XRP Ledger roadmap is turning into practical capability while connecting ongoing development directly to XRP’s expanding utility. RippleX unveils focus areas for XRPL DeFi In a recent blog, RippleX shared an update on the XRP Ledger Institutional DeFi roadmap, which details how the XRP Ledger is progressing toward everyday institutional use, with XRP at the center of settlement, FX, collateral and on-chain credit. RippleX stated in a tweet that the focus areas this year for XRP Ledger institutional DeFi are lending, privacy and permissioned on-chain markets. Ripple X shares features that have already gone live on the XRP Ledger and what is coming, which includes Permissioned DEX, Lending Protocol (XLS-65/66), Confidential Transfers for MPTs to be released in Q1, Smart Escrows, MPT DEX Integration and Institutional DeFi Portal. Later this year, native on-ledger credit markets will be introduced through the Lending Protocol. The Lending protocol will enable XRP in lending, where XRP can be both borrowed and lent. It is also the default bridge asset in FX flows and settlement.34:T1af6,Your day-ahead look for Feb. 6, 2026 Feb 6, 2026, 12:15 p.m. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Friday's crypto markets are a sea of green, bouncing from yesterday's brutal drubbing in a classic oversold rebound. But real risks linger, threatening any lasting recovery. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Bitcoin has climbed back to $65,000 after flirting with $60,000, with BlackRock ETF action hinting at capitulation, that is, long-term holders dumping at a loss, often the bear market's final gasp. The broader market has perked up, too, with XRP, SOL, ETH and other tokens regaining some poise, while the CoinDesk 20 Index added nearly 9% since midnight UTC. Still, put options on bitcoin remain in demand, signaling persistent downside fear. It makes sense for a couple of key reasons: First, macro risks have eased, but aren't gone. President Donald Trump signed a funding bill Tuesday to end the government shutdown, but the Department of Homeland Security cash runs dry in eight days, which means there could be another circus by Feb. 14. Meanwhile, oil prices are buoyant on both sides of the Atlantic on concerns the Iran-U.S. tensions will escalate. A spike there could add to global inflation, triggering a flight to safety and hammering risk assets like crypto. Most critically, the recent crash has pushed many holders and digital-asset treasuries underwater. Many of those may capitulate and become marginal sellers in the market, potentially capping rallies. Plus, confidence tends to rebuild only slowly after a crash, which is why snapback recoveries always crawl. These things taken together indicate that the market may not be out of the woods yet.

Ripple positions XRPL lending and permissioned markets for institutional DeFi adoption. XRP’s price volatility now stress-tests Ripple’s 2026 institutional finance ambitions. Ripple’s newly outlined roadmap for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is arriving at a pivotal moment. On the one hand, the company is positioning XRPL as a foundation for institutional DeFi. On the other hand, one of the most prominent XRP treasury firms—Evernorth—is already experiencing the risks and potential rewards of that vision in real time. Institutional DeFi on XRPL Could Turn Idle XRP Into Yield-Generating Capital Evernorth holds roughly 473 million XRP and has signaled plans for a Nasdaq debut under the ticker XRPN. However, recent market conditions have exposed the downside of such a concentrated treasury strategy. Sponsored Sponsored With XRP trading around $1.33, CoinGecko data shows the asset has fallen nearly 7% in the past 24 hours, leaving Evernorth with an estimated $380 million in unrealized losses . XRP Price Performance. Source: CoinGecko The situation highlights a paradox facing crypto treasury companies: large holdings can amplify upside in bull markets but also magnify losses in downturns . This is especially true when the underlying infrastructure intended to unlock additional value is still being built. Ripple’s Institutional DeFi Push Ripple’s latest update on the XRPL roadmap frames the network’s next phase as a transition from a payments-focused blockchain to a broader financial infrastructure layer. The Institutional DeFi roadmap details how the XRP Ledger is advancing toward everyday institutional use, with XRP at the center of settlement, FX, collateral, and onchain credit. The blog covers what is live, what is coming, and how developers can build toward compliant… — RippleX (@RippleXDev) February 5, 2026 According to Ripple, new features are designed to enable regulated institutions to move lending, settlement, and liquidity operations on-chain. Sponsored Sponsored Notably, XRP would function as a bridge asset and settlement layer, with the new features comprising: Permissioned markets Confidential transfers Tokenized collateral tools, and A native lending protocol “[The ledger is growing into] an end-to-end operating system for real-world finance, with XRP playing a central role in payments, liquidity, and credit markets,” read an excerpt in the blog. Among the upcoming upgrades, the XRPL Lending Protocol (XLS-66) is attracting particular attention for its potential to open on-ledger credit markets. The system is expected to introduce pooled liquidity through Single-Asset Vaults, fixed-term lending structures, and automated repayment mechanisms. Notably, these features are intended to mirror traditional credit markets while preserving blockchain transparency and efficiency. Sponsored Sponsored Evernorth’s High-Stakes Bet on Yield For Evernorth, these developments are more than theoretical. The firm has already indicated plans to deploy its XRP holdings into the lending ecosystem once the protocol goes live. Sagar Shah, Chief Business Officer at Evernorth, recently described the initiative as a major shift in how on-chain institutional liquidity could operate. He noted that participation in XRPL’s lending infrastructure could help unlock significant yield opportunities for XRP holders and the broader ecosystem. If successful, the strategy could transform large XRP treasuries from passive reserves into active, income-generating assets. This could reduce sell pressure while increasing network activity. Execution Risk Remains Despite the long-term narrative, key uncertainties remain. The lending protocol still requires full deployment and validator support. Also, the broader success of Ripple’s roadmap depends on whether institutions actually allocate capital to XRPL-based markets at scale. Infrastructure alone does not guarantee adoption. Liquidity, regulatory clarity, and real-world use cases will ultimately determine whether institutional DeFi on XRPL becomes a meaningful sector or remains a niche experiment. Sponsored Sponsored A Test Case for XRP’s Future Evernorth’s current losses, combined with its long-term commitment to deploying capital within the XRPL, are making it an early test case for Ripple’s broader thesis. If lending, privacy features, and permissioned markets attract meaningful institutional participation, today’s treasury losses could be reframed as early positioning in a new financial infrastructure layer. If adoption fails to materialize, however, the risks of concentrated treasury strategies may overshadow the promise of institutional DeFi. As it stands, therefore, the market remains caught between those two possibilities: Short-term volatility on one side A still-unproven vision of XRP-powered financial rails on the other.

Jacob King, founder of SwanDesk, laid out a 16-step breakdown of how Bitcoin could enter what he calls a “worst-case, totally catastrophic domino effect of cascading failures.” BTC crashed toward $60,000 today , with on-chain data showing $3.2 billion in realized losses on February 5 alone. That figure is larger than what investors lost during the Terra-Luna crash or the FTX bankruptcy, making it the most severe single-day capitulation event in Bitcoin’s history. What Does King’s Bitcoin Doomsday Look Like? King’s scenario begins with exchange liquidity collapsing under sustained ETF outflows, creating what he describes as a “self-reinforcing capitulation loop.” Retail investors rush for the exits, but platforms freeze or go dark. Exchanges lacking reserves start banning withdrawals altogether. From there, things get worse. Tether comes under federal pressure and stops printing new supply, removing the artificial liquidity that has historically helped spark rebounds. Miners, hit by falling rewards and rising energy costs, dump their BTC reserves onto a market that already has no buyers. Then comes the big domino. King warns that heavily leveraged corporate holders like MicroStrategy could face margin calls, forcing “massive involuntary liquidations” of hundreds of thousands of coins. Demand vanishes. Tether depegs. Hashrate collapses so far that a 51% attack becomes realistic. “The story of Bitcoin mirrors the Titanic. It was said to be unsinkable, but that was never true. You will see,” King wrote. Also Read: Why Is Bitcoin Crashing Today? Analysts Say Synthetic BTC Supply Is the Real Problem Can Bitcoin Actually Fall That Far? The fear is not entirely detached from reality. Market depth, the amount of capital available to absorb large sell orders, sits more than 30% below where it was in October. That kind of thin liquidity means even moderate selling can trigger sharp moves down. Historical patterns offer some perspective. Each Bitcoin bear cycle has produced a smaller drawdown than the one before: 93% in 2011, roughly 77% in 2022. If that trend continues from the $126,000 peak, a potential floor sits somewhere around $38,000. Whether King’s full doomsday chain plays out is debatable, but traders need to be on full alert.

Bitcoin recorded $3.2 billion in realized losses on February 5 alone, surpassing losses seen during the Terra-Luna crash or FTX bankruptcy. King's catastrophic scenario begins with ETF outflows causing exchange liquidity collapse, followed by retail panic, exchanges freezing withdrawals, Tether stopping new supply, miners dumping reserves, and heavily leveraged corporate holders like MicroStrategy facing margin calls. This could lead to Tether depegging, hashrate collapse, and potential 51% attacks.

While King's extreme scenario is debated, market depth currently sits more than 30% below October levels, meaning even moderate selling could trigger sharp downward moves. Historical patterns show decreasing drawdowns in each bear cycle, from 93% in 2011 to roughly 77% in 2022. If this trend continues from Bitcoin's $126,000 peak, a potential floor might be around $38,000.

The asset has faced a massive price correction over the last few days, falling as low as $62,822 earlier today, Feb. 6, 2026. According to CoinGecko data, BTC’s price has dipped 5.9% in the last 24 hours , nearly 20% in the last week 26.1% in the 14-day charts, and 28.5% over the previous month. BTC has also fallen by more than 47% from its all-time high of $126,080, which it attained in October 2025. Let’s discuss why Bitcoin’s (BTC) price crash in 2026 should excite you for the future.

Vanadi Coffee Bitcoin Treasury Plan – Source: Tekedia Bitcoin (BTC) is among the best-performing assets of the last decade and a half. Despite the price correction, BTC has still out-performed top tech stocks over the last 10 years. Many investors missed buying BTC in the last dip. The original crypto fell to the $15,000 price level in 2022 after the collapse of FTX, and then climbed to beyond $100,000 by December 2024, just about two years later. The latest price dip presents another opportunity for investors to buy Bitcoin (BTC) for cheap rates. You could make big returns if you enter BTC at current low rates. Also Read: Bitcoin Fell To $15k In 2022, Then Hit $100k In 2024: A P attern? Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be displaying a pattern of dipping before climbing to never-before-seen heights. Going by that theory, BTC could be preparing for another massive upswing in the next bull run. Many industry experts, such as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Strategy chief Michael Saylor, etc., believe BTC will eventually breach the $1 million mark. If Bitcoin (BTC) is on its way to $1 million, the current price levels could prove to be an excelent entry point. Your investment could grow 10x when BTC eventually hits $1 million.3a:Tef1,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 Ripple’s [XRP] price structure has been trending downwards, printing lower highs while sliding from above $3.50 toward the $1.50 zone. As prices weakened, derivatives activity moved in the opposite direction, creating a visible divergence that framed the current positioning. According to Maartun, a crypto analyst, Open Interest (OI) expanded by roughly +12% in the past 24 hours, at press time. This was not in a single spike but a sustained build across multiple sessions, particularly during relief bounces in November and early January. This rise aligned with increased ETF desk activity and heavier hedging flows, suggesting institutional participation alongside directional bets. Source: X Yet the context matters. Rising OI into a falling price usually signals something other than pure accumulation. Instead, it often reflects speculative leverage entering short exposure or late long positioning attempting dip entries. Liquidation clusters and sell alerts near local tops reinforce that leverage, not spot demand, drives the expansion. As positioning thickens while price compresses, market fragility increases rather than stabilizes. Leverage expansion during price decline often precedes volatility expansion, rather than immediate reversal. Derivatives positioning signals compression XRP’s derivatives market reveals mounting pressure beneath its price action. Funding Rates, which have hovered near neutral, have recently shifted slightly negative. This shift shows shorts paying longs, pointing to growing bearish crowding rather than balanced positioning. As this develops, OI-weighted funding tightens while price falls from the $3.00 region toward $1.50, reinforcing that leverage expansion is driving the move rather than spot selling. The Long/Short R atio adds further context. Seller dominance remains visible across several intervals, with taker sell volume exceeding buy pressure while price trends lower. Source: CoinGlass This alignment reflects clear directional conviction instead of random market activity. Yet liquidation mapping introduces another layer. Heatmap ladders cluster heavily between $1.35 and $1.45 above price, while deeper long liquidations rest near $1.18–$1.22 below. Source: CoinGlass This stacked positioning creates two volatility pathways. Negative funding combined with elevated OI builds short-squeeze potential if the price moves into overhead ladders. On the other hand, failure to rise exposes trapped long positions to cascading liquidations. Market structure, therefore, remains squeeze-prone, not trend-resolved. XRP trades in a clear downtrend, forming lower highs while moving closer to key support. Price recently tested the $1.15 swing low, which aligns with the 100% Fibonacci retracement, where short-term buying appeared. From that level, a small rebound pushed the price toward $1.29, yet momentum remains weak as the broader structure stays bearish. Source: TradingView Above, $1.44 marks former support that has turned into resistance, strengthened by the 78.6% retracement near $1.39. A daily move back above this zone would reduce downside pressure, allowing price to rotate toward the 50% level at $1.73. However, failure to hold $1.15 on a daily close would weaken market confidence, leaving XRP exposed to a deeper move toward the psychological $1.00 level. Final Thoughts XRP declines as Open Interest builds +12%, signaling leverage expansion and rising market fragility rather than spot-driven accumulation. Bearish crowding, negative funding, and dense liquidation ladders leave price squeeze-prone, while $1.15 support remains the breakdown trigger.

This subdued price action came as the stablecoin market has surged, with Tether and Circle minting billions of dollars’ worth of new tokens in recent days. At first glance, the expansion of digital dollar supply appears to suggest renewed liquidity entering the ecosystem. However, a closer look at flows indicates a more cautious, structurally constrained market. Stablecoins function as the primary liquidity rails of the crypto economy, enabling trading, leverage, settlement, and capital mobility without touching the traditional banking system. As a result, changes in their issuance and movement are often scrutinized for signals about market direction. In this instance, the divergence between rising issuance and weakening exchange flows highlights a market that is accumulating liquidity defensively rather than deploying it aggressively. Stablecoin minting accelerates On Feb. 4, blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain reported that Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC collectively added more than $3 billion in newly minted supply over a three-day period. This came even as Bitcoin and other major tokens failed to sustain any upward momentum . The rapid increase was further corroborated by Tether, which reported that USDT ended the fourth quarter of 2025 with a market capitalization of $187.3 billion, an increase of $12.4 billion from the prior quarter. Tether USDT Supply as of 2025 Q4. (Source: Tether) According to the firm, that growth occurred despite a contraction in the broader crypto market, in which digital asset prices fell sharply following the October 2025 sell-off. Historically, stablecoin issuance has tended to rise during periods of volatility. Traders often rotate into dollar-pegged tokens to preserve value while remaining positioned to re-enter the market quickly. In some cycles, bursts of issuance have preceded rallies, as fresh liquidity was deployed into spot and derivatives markets. In others, they have coincided with prolonged consolidation, reflecting caution rather than conviction. The current episode appears closer to the latter. While supply is increasing, the destination and use of that liquidity matter more than the headline numbers. Exchange flows point to liquidity withdrawal, not deployment Data from CryptoQuant suggests the crypto market is experiencing a sustained drawdown in risk-facing liquidity. After expanding by more than $140 billion since 2023, the total stablecoin market capitalization peaked in late 2025 before beginning to decline in December. More telling than aggregate supply, however, are net flows of stablecoins into and out of exchanges. During periods of rising risk appetite, stablecoins typically flow to exchanges , where they can be readily converted into BTC or ETH or used as margin for leveraged trades. Outflows, by contrast, tend to signal capital preservation, as funds are moved off exchanges into self-custody or lower-risk uses. In October 2025, exchange flows reflected exceptional momentum. Average monthly net inflows of stablecoins exceeded $9.7 billion, with nearly $8.8 billion directed to Binance alone, according to CryptoQuant. Stablecoins Exchange Netflows (Source: CryptoQuant) That surge in liquidity coincided with Bitcoin’s rally toward a new all-time high and supported elevated leverage across derivatives markets. Since November, the pattern has reversed. Those inflows have been largely erased, first through a sharp decline of roughly $9.6 billion, followed by a brief stabilization, and then renewed outflows. The data shows more than $4 billion in net stablecoin withdrawals from exchanges, including about $3.1 billion from Binance. This trend points to rising risk aversion and, in some cases, capitulation among later market entrants. Some of the outflows may also reflect internal exchange adjustments, as platforms reduce support for underutilized stablecoins amid weaker demand. Even accounting for those factors, the persistence of withdrawals suggests that liquidity is retreating from the venues where price discovery and leverage are most concentrated. Stablecoin issuance and price decouple as liquidity becomes defensive The divergence between rising issuance and falling exchange balances reflects a key distinction often lost in market narratives. Minting stablecoins does not automatically translate into buying power for risk assets. Instead, it represents potential liquidity rather than deployed liquidity.

You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. In the current environment, that potential appears to be held in reserve. Stablecoins are increasingly used as a parking asset during periods of uncertainty, allowing traders to remain within the crypto ecosystem without taking directional exposure. In derivatives markets, ample stablecoin balances can dampen funding rate volatility and support hedging strategies, but they do not necessarily drive spot demand. So, Bitcoin's current struggle to break decisively higher despite the expansion of stablecoin supply reflects this dynamic. The capital exists, but it is being used to manage risk rather than to express it. This helps explain why BTC fell below $70,000, as it failed to attract sustained follow-through liquidity. Meanwhile, this pattern also contrasts with other asset classes. CryptoQuant notes that, although digital assets have faced a persistent liquidity shortfall, capital continues to flow into equities and precious metals, where macroeconomic uncertainty has not deterred risk-taking to the same extent. Stablecoins cement their role as infrastructure, not a catalyst Despite the near-term headwinds, the long-term trajectory of stablecoins remains one of structural growth. The total stablecoin market surpassed $300 billion in 2025, cementing digital dollars as a core layer of crypto market infrastructure. Tether and Circle continue to dominate issuance and transaction activity, even as competition from newer issuers and tokenized bank deposits intensifies. Circle has emphasized USDC’s regulatory posture and reserve transparency as it courts institutional users, while Tether’s global footprint has made USDT the dominant settlement asset across offshore markets. Together, they underpin trading, lending, and cross-border flows that increasingly operate outside traditional banking hours and channels. The current episode demonstrates that infrastructure growth does not guarantee immediate price appreciation. Stablecoins are expanding as tools for settlement and capital management, even as traders remain cautious about deploying that capital into volatile assets. For Bitcoin, the implication is clear. The constraint is not a lack of dollars in the system, but a lack of willingness to put those dollars to work. Until stablecoin flows return to exchanges and funding conditions shift decisively, rallies are likely to face resistance. In that sense, the recent wave of minting is less a signal of imminent upside than a reflection of a market waiting for clarity. Mentioned in this article Posted in3c:T81c,contributor Posted: February 6, 2026 Leading companies, exchanges, investors, and regulators will gather at one venue to set the course for market development in 2026. 2026 begins at a point when the Russian crypto market is finally emerging from its “experimental” state and transforming into a fully-fledged infrastructure. Exchanges are adapting to new requirements, mining is experiencing another technological breakthrough, Web3 teams are growing faster than ever, and government agencies are talking about digital assets with increasing frequency. This is why the VIII Crypto Summit is becoming an event that could determine the rules of the game for the coming year. On March 25-26, the teams driving the market forward—those who create tools, make decisions, build infrastructure, and solve dozens of real-world problems—will gather at MTS Live Hall. This year, the Crypto Summit will focus not only on familiar topics, but also on issues that have been discussed behind the scenes until now: What will the new regulatory architecture be? What will happen to the Web3 economy after the integration of AI? Is a new wave of real-world asset tokenization expected in 2026? And most importantly, what are the companies that survived the turbulence of 2024–2025 preparing for? This won’t just be a discussion. There will be a reconciliation of strategies between the government, industry, infrastructure, and business. The VIII Crypto Summit will be attended by exchange owners, integrators, miners, investors, Web3 teams, infrastructure projects, and research centers—those who don’t just “follow the crypto industry,” but shape it. 2026 promises to be a turning point for the crypto industry. And the place where this will become clear is the VIII Crypto Summit. The general partner will be the MEXC exchange.

Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) purchased an additional 3,600 Bitcoin for approximately $233 million on Friday, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 6,230 BTC valued at around $410 million at current market prices, according to on-chain data . Binance targets converting $1 billion of stablecoin reserves in the SAFU fund into Bitcoin in 30 days. The company surpassed 40% of its goal in four days. SAFU, established in July 2018 following a security breach, functions as an emergency reserve to protect user assets in the event of hacks or exchange issues. The fund reached $1 billion in value by January 2022, funded through allocations from trading fees. Binance announced the strategic shift to Bitcoin holdings on January 30, citing transparency, auditability, and inflation hedging as primary motivations. The conversion process began on February 2 with an initial purchase of 1,315 BTC for over $100 million. The exchange has committed to restoring SAFU to $1 billion if its value falls below $800 million. The fund currently safeguards assets for over 300 million users.3f:T56c,COIN lost 13.34% on the day to close at $146.12 amid ongoing tanking of the crypto market which has seen bitcoin fall as low as $60,000, its lowest since November 2024.

COIN lost 13.3% on the day to close at $146.12 amid ongoing tanking of the crypto market which has seen bitcoin BTC $65,998.81 fall as low as $60,000, its lowest point since November 2024 .

The shares are worth $17.8 million, based on BLSH's closing price of $24.90, nearly 8.5% lower on the day . Bullish is also the parent company of CoinDesk. It is common to see ARK Invest make sizeable purchases of crypto-adjacent companies when their prices slide due to broader downturns in the cryptocurrency market. The Florida-based company attempts to capitalize on the chance to capture greater value from equities and rebalance the holdings of its funds to reflect the different prices. However, it is somewhat rarer to see ARK use this as a window to offload shares in a major crypto holding such as Coinbase.40:T9e9,ARK Invest, the asset manager led by prominent Bitcoin bull Cathie Wood, has shifted from buying to selling Coinbase stock, as the shares dipped 13% and hit multi-month lows. On Thursday, ARK offloaded 119,236 Coinbase (COIN) shares, valued at roughly $17.4 million, according to a trade filing seen by Cointelegraph. The sale comes just a day after a modest 3,510-share ($630,000) purchase on Tuesday, following a series of buys at higher prices earlier in 2026. This marks ARK’s first Coinbase sale of 2026 and its first since August 2025, signaling a shift in trading strategy.

The sharp fall triggered panic selling, heavy liquidations, and pushed market sentiment into extreme fear across crypto traders. Extreme Fear and Bitcoin RSI Signals Show Panic Conditions On 5th Feb, Bitcoin broke below the key $70,000 support and quickly dropped close to $60,000 before seeing a small recovery. The fall triggered three major technical breakdown signals, pointing to strong downside momentum. In just one week, Bitcoin has fallen nearly 25%, marking one of the fastest corrections this year. Meanwhile, trading volume was more than 3x the normal price level, showing panic selling and heavy liquidations. Secondly, more than $60 billion was wiped from the crypto market during the drop. Lastly, Bitcoin’s daily RSI fell near 9, an extreme level usually seen only during panic phases. The crypto fear index also plunged to 5, deep in the extreme fear zone. Such signals often appear near short-term bottoms, but analysts warn that oversold markets can stay weak for longer. Bitcoin may now move in a broad range between $60,000 and $73,000 in the coming weeks. If selling pressure rises again, traders fear another drop toward the $55,000 level. Bitcoin Dominance Drops Sharply Against Altcoins Additionally, Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) dropped 1.64% in a single day, and its RSI is rolling over, signaling weakening strength. At the same time, combined stablecoin dominance has jumped sharply, which usually means investors are moving to cash and reducing risk. Meanwhile, altcoin dominance is rising mainly because Bitcoin is falling faster than altcoins, not due to real market strength. Ethereum and Altcoins Follow With Heavy Losses Following the Bitcoin drop, Ethereum plunged about 30% during the same period, with its daily RSI near 11. The ETH/BTC ratio continues to trend lower, showing that Ethereum is weaker than Bitcoin in this correction. Several major altcoins also broke long-term support levels. Large-cap altcoins like BNB, SOL, LTC, and XRP moved into oversold territory, with some hitting multi-month lows after the market-wide dump.

This steep decline, which saw Bitcoin drop nearly 25% in just one week, was accompanied by multiple technical breakdown signals including extremely oversold RSI levels, trading volumes three times the norm, and approximately $60 billion being wiped from the crypto market. The crypto fear index plunged to 5, deep in extreme fear territory, which often signals potential short-term bottoms, though analysts caution that oversold markets can remain weak for extended periods.

Ethereum and major altcoins followed Bitcoin's downward trajectory, with ETH plunging about 30% and its RSI reaching near 11. The ETH/BTC ratio continues to decline, indicating Ethereum is underperforming Bitcoin in this correction. Large-cap altcoins including BNB, SOL, LTC, and XRP have also moved into oversold territory, with some hitting multi-month lows. Market analysts suggest Bitcoin may trade in a broad range of $60,000-$73,000 in the coming weeks, with potential further downside to $55,000 if selling pressure resumes.43:Tb47,Bitcoin ประสบกับการทรุดตัวอย่างหนัก 14% ลงสู่ระดับ 60,000 ดอลลาร์ก่อนจะฟื้นตัวเล็กน้อยสู่ระดับ 65,000 ดอลลาร์ ทำให้เกิดความกลัวและการขายแพงในตลาดคริปโต การลดลงที่สูงขึ้นนี้ซึ่งทำให้ Bitcoin ร่วงลงเกือบ 25% ในเวลาเพียงหนึ่งสัปดาห์ มาพร้อมกับสัญญาณการทรุดตัวทางเทคนิคหลายอย่างรวมถึงระดับ RSI ที่ขายมากเกินไปอย่างรุนแรง ปริมาณการซื้อขายที่สูงกว่าปกติถึงสามเท่า และมูลค่ากว่า 60 พันล้านดอลลาร์ที่ถูกทิ้งจากตลาดคริปโต ดัชนีความกลัวคริปโตร่วงลงสู่ระดับ 5 ซึ่งลึกเข้าไปในโซนความกลัวสุดขั้ว ซึ่งมักส่งสัญญาณถึงจุดต่ำระยะสั้นที่อาจเกิดขึ้น แม้ว่านักวิเคราะห์จะเตือนว่าตลาดที่ขายมากเกินไปอาจยังคงอ่อนแออยู่ได้นาน

Updated Feb 6, 2026, 11:39 a.m. Published Feb 6, 2026, 11:38 a.m. (Yashowardhan Singh/Unsplash modified by CoinDesk) What to know: Bitcoin’s plunge to $60,000 marked its lowest level since October 2024 and one of the most oversold readings in its history, often a precursor to sharp bounces. More than $2.6 billion in futures positions were liquidated in 24 hours, mostly longs, as key support near $70,000 gave way and open interest collapsed. Altcoins and DeFi were hit hardest, though pockets of strength emerged in tokens like DCR and HYPE, while investors rotated toward bitcoin and stablecoins. Thursday's selloff was one of the sharpest and most devastating in crypto market history: More than $2.6 billion was liquidated as bitcoin BTC $66,263.80 tumbled to $60,000 to mark its lowest point since October 2024. The drawdown led to bitcoin being the third most "oversold" in its history , according to the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that tracks market conditions. Oversold conditions of this magnitude historically precede a major bounce. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The situation grew a bit brighter as Asia woke up, with bitcoin bouncing from $60,000 to above $65,000 while ether ETH $1,926.58 came off a low of $1,750 to trade back at $1,920. Even so, the broader crypto market remains in a bear market. Privacy coin zcash ZEC $227.77 has lost 34% of its value over the past week, while optimism OP $0.1733 , solana SOL $81.57 and ether are all dealing with losses of around 30%. Traditional markets have also struggled in recent days. The Nasdaq 100 index dropped 6% since Jan. 28, and precious metals gold and silver are down by 12% and 38%, respectively, over the same period. Derivatives positioning The crypto futures market is worth less than $100 billion for the first time since March 2025, as traders continue to reduce risk as prices slide and liquidations cause wealth destruction. Over $2.6 billion in leveraged futures bets have been liquidated, or forced closed, by exchanges due to margin shortage in 24 hours. Out of that, over $2.10 billion were long bets. This shows the degree of bullish leverage that was deployed around the pivotal $70,000 support, which was breached Thursday. Open interest (OI) has declined in futures tied to all major tokens, including recent outperformer HYPE. Annualized perpetual funding rates for major tokens such as BTC, SOL, XRP and DOGE have flipped negative as price crashes triggered demand for bearish bets. The negative rates could see arbitrageurs resort to reverse cash and carry bets. Bitcoin's annualized 30-day implied volatility surged to nearly 100% late Thursday as traders scrambled to buy puts, with some snapping up these bearish bets at strike prices as low as $20,000. Since then, volatility has pulled back to under 70%. A similar pattern is seen in ether's implied volatility. Still, bitcoin and ether short-term put options continue to trade at a volatility premium of 20 or more points to calls, a sign of lingering downside worries. Puts remain pricier at the long end as well. Options tied to BlackRock's IBIT ETF saw record activity Thursday, with traders rushing to buy puts. The one-year skew rose to over 25 points, reflecting a massive premium for put options, indicating peak fear. Token talk The altcoin sector presented a couple of unlikely winners despite the broader market decline on Thursday. Privacy-focused decred DCR $22.67 rose by 31% in 24 hours, seemingly unperturbed by the carnage as it added to a rally that has lifted it from $17.4 to $24.2. HyperLiquid's HYPE token continues to perform well, relatively speaking, as it remains up 11% this week despite falling 4% in the past 24 hours. XRP was one of the most volatile altcoins, plunging by more than 30% before bouncing by 21%. Trading volume topped $14 billion, a 143% rise over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) and CoinDesk 80 (CD80) both fell by around 6% in the past 24 hours, but the concerning corner of the market was DeFi, with the DeFi Select Index (DFX) underperforming the wider market with a decline of more than 10%. CoinMarketCap's "altcoin season" indicator is now at 24/100, down from Wednesday's high of 32/100, suggesting investors are seeking safer, less volatile assets like bitcoin or stablecoins.45:T689,Several Ethereum whales are at risk of major liquidations as ETH trades near $1,900. Trend Research leads with 356,000 ETH ($671 million) vulnerable between $1,562 and $1,698, followed by Joseph Lubin with 293,000 ETH ($553 million) and the “7 Siblings” group with 287,000 ETH ($541 million) exposed near $1,029 to $1,075. Trend Research recently sold 170,000 ETH ($322 million) and repaid $344 million in loans, reducing exposure. If ETH prices drop further, forced liquidations could trigger sell-offs, though adding collateral may help whales avoid wipeouts.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has made a significant move on Bitcoin (BTC) despite the coin’s downward journey. As spotted by Lookonchain, an on-chain analytics platform, Binance purchased 3,600 BTC valued at approximately $233.37 million. Binance SAFU expands Bitcoin holdings to $434.5 million Notably, this purchase was initiated through the Binance Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). This is Binance’s emergency insurance reserve meant to protect users during periods of challenge, like hacks or liquidity problems. This new purchase by Binance SAFU takes the total volume of Bitcoin bought to 6,230 BTC, as it previously held 2,600 BTC. The total value of its Bitcoin holding now stands at about $434.5 million. It represents a significant amount for Binance SAFU. The addition of more Bitcoin shows confidence from Binance that they are determined to strengthen their safety reserve. It could send a message of reassurance to users of the exchange that their assets are in safe hands. The move also signals institutional accumulation at a time when the Bitcoin price outlook is bearish. Binance is betting hugely on the leading crypto asset to rebound regardless of its current market performance. Market watchers are likely to interpret the development as mildly bullish and could have some impact in slowing down the downward plunge of Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at $64,598.81, which represents a 9.3% decrease in the last 24 hours. Earlier, Bitcoin lost over $10,000 as it crashed from a peak of $71,802.46 to a low of $60,074.20 before climbing to its current price. Trading volume has surged by 78.12% to $144.55 billion as it appears many other investors are also engaged in accumulation. They could be taking advantage of the massive dip to increase their portfolio while anticipating a recovery. Mixed price outlook as analysts clash on Bitcoin's next move You Might Also Like Amid the bearish outlook of the leading crypto asset, global wealth management company Stifel has sounded a warning to investors. Stifel predicted that Bitcoin could risk another 47% decline, dragging prices to $38,000 . The wealth management company cited tightening liquidity and unrelenting exchange-traded funds outflows as triggers. However, renowned investor Bill Miller believes Bitcoin could find rock bottom at $60,000. He identified this level as the cash production cost of creating every new coin that still allows Bitcoin miners to stay in business. On the extreme of the spectrum, eternal Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has urged holders of the coin to dump it. Schiff noted that Bitcoin has dropped by 60% against gold and could decline further.47:T49e,Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has made a significant Bitcoin purchase of 3,600 BTC valued at approximately $233.37 million through its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). This brings Binance SAFU's total Bitcoin holdings to 6,230 BTC, worth about $434.5 million. The purchase demonstrates Binance's commitment to strengthening its safety reserve and sends a message of reassurance to users that their assets are protected. This institutional accumulation comes despite Bitcoin's bearish market performance, which saw the cryptocurrency drop 9.3% in 24 hours to $64,598.81 after crashing from a peak of $71,802.46 to a low of $60,074.20.

The market response includes a surge in trading volume by 78.12% to $144.55 billion, suggesting many investors are also accumulating Bitcoin during the price dip. Price predictions vary widely among analysts: Stifel warns of a potential 47% decline to $38,000, Bill Miller identifies $60,000 as a potential bottom, while Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff advises holders to sell. Binance's significant purchase during this volatility may be interpreted as a mildly bullish signal, potentially slowing Bitcoin's downward trend.48:Td06,บินานซ์ ซึ่งเป็นแพลตฟอร์มแลกเปลี่ยนคริปโตเคอร์เรนซีที่ใหญ่ที่สุดในโลก ได้ทำการซื้อ Bitcoin จำนวน 3,600 BTC มูลค่าประมาณ 233.37 ล้านดอลลาร์สหรัฐผ่านกองทุนความปลอดภัยสินทรัพย์สำหรับผู้ใช้ (SAFU) ของบริษัท การซื้อครั้งนี้ทำให้ Bitcoin ที่บินานซ์ SAFU ถือครองทั้งหมดมีจำนวน 6,230 BTC มูลค่าประมาณ 434.5 ล้านดอลลาร์สหรัฐ การซื้อครั้งนี้แสดงให้เห็นถึงความมุ่งมั่นของบินานซ์ในการเสริมสร้างกองทุนสำรองความปลอดภัยและส่งสัญญาณเตือนใจผู้ใช้ว่าสินทรัพย์ของพวกเขาได้รับการปกป้อง การสะสมสินทรัพย์ระดับสถาบันในช่วงเวลานี้เกิดขึ้นแม้ Bitcoin จะมีประสิทธิภาพในตลาดที่ไม่ดีนัก ซึ่งเห็นได้จากราคาที่ลดลง 9.3% ใน 24 ชั่วโมงสู่ 64,598.81 ดอลลาร์สหรัฐ หลังจากที่ราคาตกลงมาจากจุดสูงสุดที่ 71,802.46 ดอลลาร์สหรัฐสู่ระดับต่ำสุดที่ 60,074.20 ดอลลาร์สหรัฐ

The bold strategy was seen as risky at one point, as the leading cryptocurrency is known for its extreme volatility. While using money from your own account is one thing, taking personal loans takes it to a whole different level. Bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted, as a crash can erase all profits in a jiffy. I n a recent Reddit post, the user highlighted that he purchased BTC using personal loans at an average price of $35,000 over four years. In total, the trader accumulated 4.75 BTC using this innovative method. However, he continued to repay the loans with funds from his day job.

Source: Shutterstock / In Green, modified by Blockworks At the time of the Reddit post, Bitcoin was trading at $76,000 level on Thursday and began attracting attracting bearish sentiments. Moreover, the trader’s wallet had ballooned to $356,000 early February 2026. That’s an unrealized profit of approximately 113% in just four years. This makes the risk worth it as his investment has more than doubled in value. The investor also revealed that he’ll be throwing in more money each month if Bitcoin dips below $70,000. He called it the perfect buying opportunity again, despite still paying off his personal loans to acquire BTC. The risk-to-reward ratio is extremely high in this scenario, but it has paid off handsomely. BTC experienced a major crash on Friday falling to the $65,000 level. The trader also revealed that he plans to take another $50,000 in personal loans if Bitcoin falls further in value. “In the meantime, I’m throwing everything I can at it each month while we’re in the $70-80k range with earned income from my job. I’ve been stacking this whole time while paying down the loans,” he wrote. Note: The post was made on Reddit, and Watcher Guru could not independently verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin holder.4c:T415,U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated remarkable resilience despite Bitcoin's price decline of over 50% since October 2025. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the BTC held by these ETFs has only decreased by approximately 7%, from 1.362 million to 1.272 million BTC. Global BTC ETF holdings showed similar strength, dropping by just 4.8% from 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC over the same period, indicating that investors, primarily 'boomers', are holding firm despite market volatility.

Bitcoin recently fell to $60K for the first time since October 2024, though it slightly recovered to $65K at press time. While BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced a record trading volume of $10 billion alongside a 13% price drop, analysts are divided about whether the market has reached its bottom. Chris Burniske expects further downside to levels around $58K or $50K, while Bitfinex analysts suggest that without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any upward movement might only represent a lower high in a fragile market.4d:Taef,กองทุน Bitcoin ETF ในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้แสดงความยืดหยุ่นอย่างน่าทึ่งแม้ในช่วงที่ราคา Bitcoin ลดลงกว่า 50% ตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2025 ตามที่ Eric Balchunas นักวิเคราะห์ ETF จาก Bloomberg ระบุ ปริมาณ Bitcoin ที่ถือโดยกองทุนเหล่านี้ลดลงเพียงประมาณ 7% เท่านั้น จาก 1.362 ล้านเหรียญเป็น 1.272 ล้านเหรียญ การถือครอง Bitcoin ETF ทั่วโลกก็แสดงความแข็งแกร่งในทำนองเดียวกัน โดยลดลงเพียง 4.8% จาก 1.50 ล้านเป็น 1.428 ล้านเหรียญ ซึ่งชี้ให้เห็นว่านักลงทุน ส่วนใหญ่เป็น "ผู้สูงอายุ" ยังคงถือหุ้นอย่างมั่นคงแม้ในช่วงที่ตลาดผันผวน

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the overall BTC held by the ETFs dropped by only about 7%. He viewed the holders, mainly boomers, as ‘diamond hands.’ “Bitcoin’s price is down 44% from October high, but the amount of BTC held by the ETFs is only down 6.6%. Boomer strong.” Source: X Before the October crash, the U.S spot BTC ETFs held a record high of 1.362 million BTC. This stash had since dropped to 1.272 million BTC by the 4th of February. Can ETFs withstand the pressure? When zoomed out to the global holdings of BTC ETFs (covering offerings in the U.S, E.U., Asia, and others), the same picture emerged. Over the same period, global BTC ETF holdings dropped by only 72,400 BTC from October’s high of 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC. That’s only a 4.8% drop in BTC holdings. Source: BOLD report Put differently, the market fears and outflows in the past few weeks have not led to a massive drop in BTC held by ETFs. However, the asset extended its price decline over the past 24 hours, tagging $60K for the first time since October 2024. Although BTC price had moved up slightly to $65K at press time, there was still uncertainty about whether it had reached its final market bottom. Source: Bloomberg That said, the latest dump saw BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) post its record daily trading volume of $10 billion and its second-worst price drop 13%. For Balchunas , this was ‘brutal,’ further raising questions about the ETF buyers’ ability to remain resilient if markets go lower. Is $60K the market bottom? Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a VC partner at Placeholder and former Ark Invest crypto lead, said the sub-$60K levels were of ‘interest’ but expected an extra downside. “Watching with interest, but not buying yet. Expect a bounce, but doubt the bloodletting is done.” Chris nailed the October market top and the ensuing drawdown. He had projected that the market could bottom near $58K or $50K (levels that aligned with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and on-chain cost basis. For their part, Bitfinex analysts appeared hopeful that the market was not in a better position to form a bottom after the price dropped below the previous cycle peak of $69K. But they also echoed Burniske’s caution, “Order books show most demand under $66k as support bids were hit or pulled. That can set up a relief bounce, but without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any move risks being just a lower high in a fragile market.” Source: Bitfinex Final Thoughts BTC held by U.S spot ETFs has dropped by only 7% despite BTC’s +50% price decline since October 2025 Despite the extended dip to $60K-$65K zone, analysts appeared cautiously optimistic for a potential BTC bottom.4f:Td75,HBAR trades within four month pattern as bullish divergence builds quietly. Breakout above $0.1042 risks triggering $6 million short liquidations. Loss of $0.0786 support would invalidate bullish breakout overwhelmingly. Hedera has remained under selling pressure after a steady decline brought HBAR back to retest a long-standing technical pattern. The token has been trading within this structure for several months, limiting upside attempts. While multiple indicators now point toward a bullish setup, price action has yet to confirm the shift, keeping sentiment cautious. HBAR Has An Underlying Bullish Trigger HBAR’s Money Flow Index is showing early signs of strength despite continued price weakness. On the two-day chart, the indicator is forming a bullish divergence with the price. While HBAR has printed a lower low, the MFI has held higher lows, indicating rising buying pressure beneath the surface. Sponsored Sponsored This divergence suggests that selling momentum is gradually fading. As sellers lose control, buyers begin to step in without immediately pushing prices higher. Such conditions often precede trend reversals, especially when supported by compression patterns and improving momentum indicators across higher timeframes. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . HBAR MFI. Source: TradingView Derivatives data highlights growing risk for bearish traders. The liquidation map shows that a breakout in HBAR price would place significant pressure on short positions. If the price reaches $0.1013, approximately $6.2 million in short liquidations could be triggered, forcing rapid position closures. Given the pattern HBAR is currently trading within, a breakout could occur quickly once resistance is breached. Forced liquidations typically accelerate price movement, amplifying upside momentum. As a result, short traders face heightened exposure if HBAR breaks above its current range. HBAR Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass HBAR Price Breakout Is Possible HBAR price is trading near $0.0826 at the time of writing, holding above the $0.0786 support level. The altcoin has been moving within a descending channel for nearly four months. This structure reflects prolonged consolidation while volatility continues to compress. A breakout from this pattern appears increasingly likely as selling pressure dissipates on a macro scale. Confirmation would require HBAR to breach the channel’s upper trendline and flip $0.1042 into support. Such a move would trigger short liquidations and push the price toward $0.129, the pattern’s projected 32% upside target. HBAR Price Analysis. Source: TradingView However, downside risk remains if broader market conditions fail to improve. A loss of the $0.0786 support would weaken the structure. Under that scenario, HBAR could slide toward $0.0622. A move to that level would invalidate the bullish thesis entirely.

Executives previously confirmed plans to Decrypt for a POLY token and a possible airdrop focused on “true utility.” The move comes as Polymarket faces fresh legal challenges, with traders seeing low odds of a token launch before May. Polymarket has filed trademark applications for " POLY " and " $POLY " with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, signaling concrete steps toward launching its long-anticipated native token , even as the prediction market faces mounting regulatory challenges. The filings, submitted Thursday by Polymarket's parent company Blockratize Inc., cover trademark protection for “cryptocurrency services, financial trading platforms, and blockchain-based payment systems.” Both applications describe services for "providing a digital currency or digital token for use by members of an on-line community via a global computer network" and list cryptocurrency trading, financial exchange services, and portfolio management among their intended uses. Polymarket’s token plans The trademark applications offer the first formal public paper trail tied to Polymarket’s token plans. Polymarket CMO Matthew Modabber confirmed plans for a POLY token and airdrop in October, telling Degenz Live, a show from Decrypt's sister company, Rug Radio, that the company wants the token to have "true utility" and "longevity." CEO Shayne Coplan teased the token in October by tweeting a "POLY" ticker alongside Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and BNB . Sources familiar with the matter previously told Decrypt that Polymarket does not plan to launch its token until it has regained a foothold in the U.S. market. The company moved closer to that goal in November, when it received CFTC approval to operate domestically, nearly four years after paying a $1.4 million fine and exiting the U.S. market. On prediction market Myriad , owned by Decrypt ’s parent company Dastan, users place just a 30% chance on Polymarket announcing its token before May. Prediction markets face challenges The trademark filings come at a critical juncture for Polymarket as it treads through U.S. market reentry while facing state-level legal challenges that threaten its core business model. But the path forward has grown more complicated as, most recently, the Nevada state court issued a temporary restraining order blocking Polymarket from offering event-based contracts in the state, finding its activities likely violate Nevada gaming law. The platform subsequently removed the case to federal court, claiming the state action conflicts with federal law, according to Daniel Wallach, founder and principal of Wallach Legal LLC, a law firm specializing in sports wagering and gaming law. The trademark applications await examination by the USPTO. Polymarket did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Founder of the HEX platform Richard Heart has taken to Twitter to comment on the current crypto bloodbath in the market and say that he does not believe Bitcoin to be the best cryptocurrency out there. Among the projects that Heart reckons to surpass BTC, the crypto entrepreneur named Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum. "Ethereum is better than Bitcoin" Heart published an S-curve (also known as the S-shaped curve or sigmoid curve) which visualizes how new tech, innovations, products, etc., spread around the community and become adopted by the population or within the market over time. HOT Stories I've been telling you Bitcoin was at the top of its S curve for several years now. Which means that, if you want to make mad gains, you might want to buy something better, with more potential. PulseChain is better. Ethereum is better. PLSX, HEX, and ProveX, when it comes out… pic.twitter.com/QCZedimVUZ — Richard Heart (@RichardHeartWin) February 6, 2026 Heart claims (not for the first time, according to his tweet) that Bitcoin has been at the top of its S-curve for several years already. This means that BTC is already at its mature stage, according to Heart – it has a vast support, and all users who will ever need it already have it, the growth in new users is slowing down drastically. Basically, Heart is certain that Bitcoin has nowhere much to grow in terms of new users and adoption. He claimed that gains can hardly be made with Bitcoin; other coins are much better suited for that. One of those, according to Heart, is Ethereum, since it has more technical potential. The entrepreneur added that the real quality and utility of a cryptocurrency does not make it a popular market asset. It is rather true about its price: “Price is a function of marketing and whether people decide to press green or red buttons.” You Might Also Like Bitcoin recovers to $66,000 Over the past day, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has managed to put up a recovery of 5.26%, returning to the $66,000 level. However, this recovery was preceded by a mammoth 30.55% collapse over the past week. On Wednesday, January 28, Bitcoin lost the $90,000 price line and began to decline rapidly, eventually landing at the $63,000 level per coin. This price collapse coincided with the 30% crash of gold and silver on January 30 after these precious metals reached new all-time highs above $5,000 and $100, respectively. Two other major reasons of the Bitcoin crash, according to analysts, have been the poor reports of the Magnificent 7 (which triggered investor fears around the AI bubble) and the fact of Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh, known for his hawkish stance on monetary policy, for the position of the new Fed chairman.55:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

Bitcoin price dropped nearly 8.6%, hovering near the $65,000 level, while Ethereum and major altcoins followed with sharp intraday losses. The intensity of the move points to more than routine profit-taking. With liquidations accelerating and sentiment collapsing into extreme fear, the ongoing crypto crash creates a dilemma among investors, one that forces traders and investors to confront a familiar question: Is this a buy-the-dip moment, or is patience still required? Liquidations Data Reveals Market Still Under Stress The key trigger of today’s crypto crash lies in derivatives data. More than $2.59 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most aggressive leverage flushes of the year. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the bulk of forced closures, while altcoins experienced cascading liquidations as price levels failed in quick succession. At the same time, total open interest fell 10.1% to $95.77 billion, confirming that leverage is being removed, not repositioned. Such conditions typically reflect instability rather than balance. Markets tend to struggle to form durable bottoms while liquidation velocity remains elevated. Sentiment Hits Extreme Fear, But Capitulation Is Incomplete The Crypto market Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, placing sentiment deep into Extreme Fear, a zone that historically precedes medium-term recoveries. However, structural signals remain mixed. Bitcoin exchange balances increased by 13,800 BTC, suggesting that selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself. Coins are still moving toward exchanges rather than being locked away by long-term holders. In previous market cycles, sustainable bottoms emerged after extreme fear persisted alongside declining exchange inflows, a condition that has not yet fully materialized. Bitcoin Price at $65K: A Decision Zone, Not a Confirmed Bottom Bitcoin’s drop toward the $65,000 region is now colliding with a signal that long-term market participants rarely ignore. The monthly stochastic oscillator has slipped into extreme oversold territory, a condition that has appeared only three times over the past decade. Each prior occurrence aligned with major bear market bottoms and the start of prolonged accumulation phases. However, history also shows this signal is not a timing trigger. In previous cycles, Bitcoin did not immediately reverse higher. Instead, price often spent weeks sometimes months moving sideways or making marginal new lows as leverage flushed out and sentiment reset. That dynamic matters today. While the long-term stochastic suggests downside may be structurally limited, short-term data still reflects stress. Open interest is falling, liquidations remain elevated, and exchange balances are rising, indicating that traders are still de-risking rather than rebuilding positions. In practical terms, this creates a split narrative. For long-horizon investors, conditions are beginning to resemble early accumulation zones. For short-term traders, volatility risk remains high until liquidation pressure eases and price stabilizes above key support. The signal argues that Bitcoin may be closer to a bottom than a top, but confirmation will require patience, not prediction. Final Thoughts: Right Time to Buy or Wait? The broader crypto market is showing classic stress signals, not clear bottoming behavior. Extreme fear readings, multi-billion-dollar liquidations, and declining open interest suggest forced deleveraging is still working its way through the system. While some assets are showing relative strength and selective accumulation, this looks more like rotation and positioning not a broad-based recovery. Historically, durable market bottoms form after volatility compresses and sellers exhaust, not during peak liquidation phases. Right now, liquidity is thin and confidence remains fragile, leaving room for further downside or prolonged consolidation. This is not a clear “buy the dip” moment for the overall market. Caution and patience are still the better strategy, with selective accumulation only where strong fundamentals and on-chain support clearly justify it.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) also suffers the same fate, dipping to the $0.000005 price level. According to CoinGecko data, SHIB’s price is down 9.2% in the last 24 hours , 17.7% in the last week, nearly 26% in the 14-day charts, and 34.7% over the previous month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are distraught, wondering if the asset’s price is at its bottom, or will it crash further. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Is Shiba Inu’s Price At Its Bottom, Or Is More Bad News On The Way? Source: WatcherGuru Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at levels last seen in July 2021. Investors are sitting on heavy losses, especially those who bought the asset at the top. SHIB’s price is currently following Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory, and may not rebound until the original crypto registers some positive price action. Some analysts anticipate BTC to fall further. Stifel anticipates BTC’s price to dip to the $38,000 level. BTC falling to $38,000 could pull Shiba Inu (SHIB) further down. However, the market seems to be making a slight rebound today. Although the rebound may see a rejection, it could also signal a bottom. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently hangs on a thread. The market-wide crash comes amid tighter Federal Reserve policies and a shrinking liquidity crisis. Macroeconomic worries and geopolitical tensions have added further fuel to the fire. Additionally, market participants took a risk-off approach with their investments. Shiba Inu (SHIB) being a memecoin carries some of the highest risks in the market. Memecoins will likely take much longer to recover than other cryptocurrencies. Also Read: New Shiba Inu Price Prediction Says SHIB May Hit $0.0004: Here’s When Given the uncertain environment and the bearishness that looms over the market, it is unclear if Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at its bottom, or if the asset’s price sill fall further. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) does not recover from its depths, SHIB will likely face additional sell pressure.58:Tcf1,Millions and millions of PI tokens will be released in the following weeks, which could bring even more pain for the bulls. The past several weeks have not been kind to the cryptocurrency markets. This trend only intensified on Thursday when the entire market bled out, with multiple double-digit price crashers. Naturally, Pi Network’s PI token was not spared, and it dumped to fresh all-time lows of under $0.135 (on CoinGecko). This meant that the asset has plunged by over 30% in the last month alone. On a broader scale, PI is down by more than 95% since its all-time high marked on February 26, 2025. Despite this massive correction, some members of the ever-vocal and optimistic Pi Network community tried to find the silver linings. This one, for example, outlined the skyrocketing PI transaction volume, which, he believes, shows “increased interest in PI despite the manipulation games done by whales.” This one was even more bullish, predicting a mind-blowing surge to $4 from the current dip in the first six months after the second Mainnet migration and once old Pioneers (Pi Network users and investors) are done selling off. More Pain to Come? If we are being realistic, it’s hard to even imagine such a rally happening soon. Not only because the overall crypto market seems to be dominated by the bears, but also due to PI’s recent price performance and the unlocking schedule for new tokens. Data from PiScan shows that almost 8 million coins will be freed in the next month on average. What’s even more worrying is the fact that this number will skyrocket to over 18 million on February 12 and to 23.6 million on February 13. Such a massive number of tokens to be unlocked might result in more immediate selling pressure from investors who have been waiting a long time for their holdings to become available for trading. This is particularly true in such a time of panic. You may also like: Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Before the FOMC Meeting, Pi Network (PI) Soars by 15%: Market Watch Pi Token Unlock Schedule.

Additionally, there are rumors circulating online that one of the largest and oldest exchanges, Kraken, might be planning to list Pi Network’s native token, which could boost its liquidity and legitimacy among investors. 🚨 BREAKING: Kraken Exchange is preparing to integrate the Pi blockchain and list $PI for trading 👀 If confirmed, this could be a major step for Pi ecosystem adoption. ⁰Eyes on what comes next. #PiNetwork #PI #Kraken #CryptoNews #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/BAWZLcGQnH — SMC KAPIL DEV (@smckapildev) February 6, 2026 SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer).

Feb 6, 2026, 10:21 a.m. Quantum computing is moving from theory to long term strategic consideration, and Strategy (MSTR) has made it clear it intends to be proactive rather than reactive during the company's Q4 earnings call on Thursday. Strategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, plans to initiate a bitcoin security program to coordinate with the global cyber, crypto, and bitcoin security community. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The company addressed growing discussion around quantum risk and reaffirmed its commitment to bitcoin security, framing quantum not as an immediate threat but as a future engineering challenge the network can prepare for. Strategy reported a net loss of $12.4 billion for the quarter. Shares fell 17% on the day, trading as low as $104, but market focus quickly shifted to executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commentary. Saylor revisited a long list of historical Bitcoin FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that the network has already overcome quantum concerns, while acknowledging that quantum deserves serious long term planning. The company outlined a range of key points on quantum computing, predicting that quantum technology is likely more than a decade away and pointing out that the Bitcoin community is already researching quantum-resistant cryptography. Shares are up 6% in pre-market trading as bitcoin has rebounded to $65,000.

On Friday, Vyper said core parts of its product will begin shutting down on Feb. 10, while limited functions will remain accessible. Users were directed to Pump.fun’s Terminal (formerly Padre) to continue using the tools. The move reflects a broader strategy by Pump.fun to consolidate more of the trading workflow, from token launches to execution and analytics, as memecoin activity cools from the speculative frenzy of late 2024 and early 2025. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Pump.fun did not respond to Cointelegraph before publication. Expansion beyond token launches Pump.fun’s acquisition of Vyper follows earlier moves into trading infrastructure. On Oct. 24, Pump.fun acquired trading terminal Padre to strengthen liquidity and improve execution for tokens launched on its platform. Padre was later rebranded and now operates as Terminal. In January, Pump.fun also launched an investment arm called Pump Fund, marking what the company described as a pivot away from a pure memecoin focus. On Jan. 20, Pump Fund debuted alongside a $3 million hackathon aimed at backing early-stage projects, including those not directly related to crypto.

The -88% XRP collapse scenario first raised by U.Today on Jan. 20 is no longer theoretical. After losing the crucial $1.88 Bollinger Band midline, XRP crashed 41% to a low of $1.121. The monthly chart structure has now entered confirmed breakdown territory, with historical parallels pointing toward $0.33 or even $0.20 as valid targets. Unless bulls reclaim the $1.60 zone with volume, each failed monthly close reinforces the magnet effect toward the lower band. What was once dismissed as an absurd scenario is now unfolding step by step on the chart — with the next phase dependent on whether XRP will go for $1 . XRP/USD by TradingView No more than 17 days ago, on Jan. 20, a shocking U.Today forecast warned that XRP could collapse to $0.20 if the $1.88 Bollinger Band midline were to fail. Two weeks later and $5 billion of liquidations after, that scenario is no longer hypothetical. HOT Stories XRP has already lost over 41% since that alert, plunging to $1.121 in the last 24 hours before bouncing weakly. Worse — February’s candle opened and dropped directly below it without even a wick retest. In technical terms, this is a close confirmation of what many chartists dread: a full-band collapse setup. Is it time to worry about XRP price? The last time XRP closed the month below the Bollinger midline after a multimonth rally was in 2018. What followed was a two-year price suppression. The current downside magnet? The lower band, sitting near $0.336. If February closes below $1.60 and fails to reclaim the midband with volume, the main expectation is a gradual bleed into the $1 zone. Out there, a breakdown below $0.99 will open the corridor toward the full -88% target for XRP, represented visually by the Bollinger Bands . You Might Also Like Those placing breakout bets since the November 2024 liftoff must now reevaluate. Every monthly candle closing below $1.918 strengthens the validity of the $0.20 magnet. As of now, the -88% collapse is not absurd, and the next checkpoints are clear too: a $1.60 retest or $1 breakdown. Either way, XRP has lost its bullish protection level .5d:Te28,Bitcoin ( BTC ) liquidated billions of dollars going into Friday as BTC price action set bearish records.

According to the earnings call held on the 5 February, the firm reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion in Q4 2025. Due to new reporting guidance, the entire loss was primarily an unrealized loss on its BTC holdings as the crypto rout intensified in late 2025 following October’s crash. Part of the report read, “Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2025 includes an unrealized loss on the Company’s digital assets of $17.4 billion. This is the fourth quarterly reporting period in which we have applied fair value accounting.” When adjusted for other incomes and expenses, the net loss for Q4 came down to $12.4 billion. Bitcoin bet weighs on Strategy The pioneer of corporate BTC treasury accumulated 713,502 coins at a cost of over $54 billion with an average price of $76k per BTC. Although this isn’t the firm’s bear market, the bet has recorded massive paper losses as BTC plunged below $65k on the charts. At press time, Strategy’s stash was worth $46.2 billion – Nearly 15% down after an $8 billion wipeout. Source: Saylor Tracker The mNAV, or relative valuation metric, between crypto holdings and the enterprise, fell further to 0.77x too, underscoring the broader bearish market sentiment. That’s not all either as its common stock, MSTR, has also not been spared from the market carnage. MSTR extends losses to 80% On Thursday, MSTR posted a 17% price decline after the earnings call and BTC’s sharp drop to $60k. This brought its losses, since the 2025 high of $453, to 76%. When zoomed from the November 2025 peak of $543, the overall losses totalled 80%. Source: MSTR vs BTC price, TradingView U.S pension funds have emerged as the hardest hit by MSTR’s meltdown. In fact, r eports indicated that 11 US pension funds may be staring down a paper loss of $330 million from holding the stock. These funds bought about 1.8 million MSTR shares at a cost of $577 million. However, they have now shrunk to $240 million as the stock dropped lower. At press time, MSTR was back to its 2024 price range of $100-$180. However, it remains to be seen whether the support will hold against bears. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff, a long-time BTC and Saylor critic, slammed the firm as a “fraud” and a “ponzi scheme.” He questioned Strategy’s capital-raising model for its BTC buys. In the past too, Schiff has taken advantage of BTC market routs to intensify attacks against the firm and Saylor. Final Thoughts Strategy reported a $17.4 billion loss in Q4, mainly due to a decline in BTC’s price which affected its unrealized PnL (profit and loss). Deepening market rout extended MSTR losses to 80% after dropping to the 2024 price range of $100-$180.5f:Tffc,In brief Crypto leaders rebuked Democrats after the party’s official X account posted “yikes” with a crypto crash graphic, calling it insensitive to investor losses across party lines. The backlash came as over $2.6B in positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with Bitcoin down 8% to $64,752. Executives and policy advocates warned that partisan mockery of market pain could hurt Democrats with crypto voters, as digital asset legislation advances before midterms. Crypto industry leaders fired back at Democrats on Friday after the party's official X account posted "yikes" alongside a graphic mocking crypto market losses, drawing accusations of partisan insensitivity as Bitcoin plunged and investors lost billions. The Democratic Party's tweet featured a chart showing Bitcoin's slide alongside an image of President Donald Trump wearing a MAGA hat, triggering immediate backlash from executives, lawyers, and government advisors who said the message dismissed widespread financial pain affecting investors across party lines. The controversial social media activity came as Bitcoin dropped 8.1% over the past 24 hours to $65,729, down 33.1% from a year earlier, according to CoinGecko data . "The sad thing about this tweet is that you're gloating in a lot of Democrats' painful financial losses right now," Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long replied to the post. "You do know that many Democrats own crypto too, right?" The crypto market saw some $2.6 billion in liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $2.13 billion coming from long positions, according to Coinglass data . Bitcoin led liquidations with $1.35 billion, including $1.1 billion from long positions, while Ethereum saw $443 million in long positions liquidated. A partisan issue? The dispute shows rising partisan tension around crypto policy, with industry voices cautioning that mocking market pain could alienate pro-crypto voters. "Probably not the message you want to be sending to the crypto community before midterms,” Patrick Witt, Executive Director of the President's Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, responded to the Democrats’ tweet. Meanwhile, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss quoted the post , saying, "It was always political persecution." Pro-XRP attorney John Deaton, who is currently running for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, connected the losses to broader economic mismanagement by both parties. "If career politicians from both parties didn't cause a $38T debt by running $2T annual deficits for decades, recklessly creating money out of thin air, devaluing our currency to the point inflation has priced regular people out of the economy—maybe they wouldn't turn to crypto to build wealth," he wrote. Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci called the Democrat post a "stupid tweet," saying “the best thing Trump has going for him is the incompetence of Democrats on this topic." Democrats vs Trump The Democrats’ post followed a tweet from California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office, which said, "Trump is crashing the crypto markets faster than he'd crash an Epstein party," further inflaming partisan tensions around crypto. In December, Newsom launched a website tracking what he called Trump's "criminal cronies," spotlighting pardoned crypto figures including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht . On Wednesday, Representative Ro Khanna launched an investigation into a $500 million UAE investment in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's crypto company, questioning whether the deal influenced U.S. policy on AI chip exports. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has repeatedly warned about Trump's conflicts of interest in crypto, noting the family has amassed over $1.2 billion in financial gains from digital assets since his second term began, while also opposing proposals to allow crypto in 401(k) retirement plans. Decrypt has reached out to the Democratic Party for comment.

As prices dropped nearly 10% to around $64,000, Bitcoin hit its lowest level since late 2024. This sharp move pushed many investors to sell their holdings at a loss. Record Losses in a Single Day February 5 stood out as a major stress point for the market. On-chain analyst Murphy reported that realized losses reached about $3.2 billion in just one day—the highest daily total ever recorded. Realized losses reflect how much money investors actually lose when they sell below their buying price, making this a strong sign of panic selling. Murphy noted that this single-day loss was even larger than what was seen during major past crises, including the Terra-Luna collapse and the FTX bankruptcy . This highlights how severe and sudden the latest sell-off has been. Low Liquidity Made the Drop Worse The Kobeissi Letter added that the decline was not driven by fear alone. It also exposed weak market liquidity. Bitcoin’s market depth, the amount of money available to absorb large trades, is still more than 30% lower than its October high. With fewer buyers at key price levels, even moderate selling can cause sharp price drops. The last time market depth was this low was after the FTX collapse in 2022, showing that the market remains fragile during periods of heavy selling. No Clear Trigger Behind the Sell-Off Unlike previous crashes caused by major news events, this downturn did not have one obvious trigger. Murphy said that aside from a data adjustment issue in late 2025, the current loss numbers reflect real selling pressure. He also defended using dollar-based loss data, saying it better shows the financial and emotional stress investors feel during sharp declines. Extreme Price Volatility The Kobeissi Letter also pointed out another first: Bitcoin recorded a single-day drop of more than $10,000. Even during earlier high-liquidation events, prices did not fall this much in one day. This has led to speculation that a large leveraged trader was forced to exit, which likely accelerated the fall and exposed how risky large positions can be. How Much Lower Can Bitcoin Go? Crypto researcher Sherlock highlighted a long-term pattern in Bitcoin’s history. Each bear market has resulted in smaller losses than the previous one, as the asset has matured. Bitcoin fell about 93% in 2011 and around 77% in 2022. If this trend continues, the current cycle could see a drop of roughly 70% from the $126,000 peak, pointing to a possible bottom near $38,000. This outlook suggests that while the recent sell-off has been painful, it may not be the final low and a quick recovery should not be taken for granted. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin is down due to low market liquidity and forced selling from leveraged positions. With fewer buyers, sell orders moved prices sharply lower. How big were the losses in the recent Bitcoin sell-off? On February 5, investors realized losses of roughly $3.2 billion in a single day—the highest daily loss ever recorded, exceeding losses seen during the Terra-Luna and FTX collapses. Could Bitcoin’s price drop further from here? Based on historical bear market patterns, Bitcoin could potentially fall around 70% from its $126,000 peak, suggesting a possible bottom near $38,000, though market conditions remain fluid. Was there a specific event that caused Bitcoin’s latest sell-off? No single news event triggered it. The drop appears driven by market structure, leverage unwinding, and fragile liquidity conditions.

ETH price has dropped significantly, slipping below $2K as the latest crypto market dumps took over the sector, wiping away trillions in their wake. This development is now impacting major crypto coins, with the Ethereum price taking a major hit in the middle. The token is down 9% in the last 24 hours, noting a 40% decline in its price in the last month. But is there more to ETH’s price? Will it crash even more than predicted price thresholds? Let’s find out. Also Read: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Dumps $6.6 Million Worth of ETH Ethereum Price Narratives: What Is Up With The Asset? Source: Decrypt Ethereum has fallen 40% in the last month, down significantly from its earlier ATH of $4K. The token is expected to have sharp volatility as of late, with its momentum hitting new roadblocks each day. The token is now sitting at $1.9K, showing a wobbly road ahead, as markets try their best to regain their lost footing. Despite the buildable pressure on the asset, experts are stating that Ethereum may ultimately come out stronger than ever, with the tokenization elements involved keeping the asset afloat and steady in the long run. The latest ETH fall is a result of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, selling 16,384 ETH, causing a temporary market mayhem. Buterin reportedly is selling ETH to solidify future plans for Ethereum, including robusting its stack software and hardware. “If you’re wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH. He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware.

Vitalik Flouts New Roadmap as Price Drops62:Tc34,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 The cryptocurrency market extended its decline, with total capitalization falling to $2.2 trillion. Altcoins, particularly Solana [SOL], suffered steep losses. Solana dropped 15%, breaking below $70 and hitting a two‑year low of $67 before rebounding slightly to $81.6. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $80.78, down 10.44% on the daily charts. At the same time, its market capitalization fell below $50 billion, indicating substantial capital outflows. Solana whale fully liquidated amid market dip Amid this downside volatility, whale investors in the futures market, especially those taking long positions, experienced forced liquidations. According to Onchain Lens, a whale got completely liquidated on its SOL long position, losing $6.7 million. Overall, the whale lost over $16 million during the current market decline. Significantly, this whale is not an isolated case. In fact, over $167 million in long positions were liquidated between February 5 and 6. Source: CoinGlass Usually, forced selling exerts immediate selling pressure on the market, further accelerating the asset’s downward momentum. Thus, these liquidations exacerbated market stress, causing Solana to decline further, particularly given the current market weakness. However, in response to this liquidation threat, investors have changed strategy and increased short positions. According to CoinGlass data, the Long Short ratio fell below 1 to 0.96 at press time. Source: CoinGlass A ratio below 1 indicates that most traders across all exchanges have taken short positions, anticipating further losses. However, Binance and OKX remain among the top traders, with the Long-Short ratio averaging 3.0. Is SOL’s bottom in yet? Solana declined further as forced selling in futures markets created additional selling pressure on an already weakened market structure. At the same time, the altcoin jumped back above $80, as investors took the slip below $70 as an opportunity to buy the dip on the spot. Source: CoinGlass As such, the altcoin’s Netflow dropped to November 2025 levels, falling to -$101 million on the 5th of February. Notably, over $7 billion worth of SOL flowed out of exchanges, a clear sign of aggressive spot accumulation. Despite this, the purchases have remained insufficient to offset market conditions, and sellers have retained complete control. In fact, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell deeper into the oversold zone, dropping to 21 as of writing. Source: TradingView With momentum indicators dropping to such a level, this suggested strong downward momentum, with buyers entirely displaced. Equally, it indicated a potential continuation of the prevailing trend. Therefore, if these conditions persist, SOL could drop again below $70. For a trend reversal, buyers must keep up and reclaim the altcoin’s Parabolic SAR at $103. Final Thoughts Solana crashed to a 2-year low of $65 before rebounding to a high of $81. Solana whale was fully liquidated on its Sol long positions, resulting in $6.7 million in losses and raising total losses to $16 million.63:T416,Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported a staggering $12.6 billion quarterly loss, primarily due to unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings as the cryptocurrency's price fell below the company's average acquisition cost. The sharp Bitcoin decline from approximately $73,100 to $62,400 during the quarter erased what were recently more than $30 billion in paper profits, highlighting the deep connection between the company's financial performance and crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business.

As the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 713,000 BTC, Strategy's stock has plummeted over 70% in the past year. Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor maintains a "HODL" strategy, while other companies like BitMine face similar unrealized losses on their Ethereum holdings. Analysts remind that Bitcoin's volatility is characteristic of its history, and long-term investors continue to focus on scarcity and long-term growth potential despite short-term price fluctuations.64:Tac0,บริษัท Strategy (เดิมชื่อ MicroStrategy) รายงานขาดทุนไตรมาสที่น่าตกใจมูลค่า 12.6 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่มาจากขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นจริงในสินทรัพย์ Bitcoin เนื่องจากราคาสกุลเงินดิจิทัลลดลงต่ำกว่าราคาซื้อเฉลี่ยของบริษัท การร่วงลงของ Bitcoin จากระดับประมาณ 73,100 ดอลลาร์เป็น 62,400 ดอลลาร์ในไตรมาสนี้ ทำให้กำไรบนกระดาษที่เคยมีมากกว่า 30 พันล้านดอลลาร์เมื่อเร็วๆ นี้หายไป ซึ่งสะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความสัมพันธ์ที่ลึกซึ้งระหว่างผลการดำเนินงานทางการเงินของบริษัทกับการเคลื่อนไหวของตลาดคริปโตมากกว่าธุรกิจซอฟต์แวร์พื้นฐาน

ในฐานะผู้ถือครอง Bitcoin รายใหญ่ที่สุดในโลกด้วยจำนวนกว่า 713,000 BTC หุ้นของ Strategy ได้ร่วงลงมากกว่า 70% ในช่วงปีที่ผ่านมา แม้จะขาดทุนเป็นประวัติการณ์ ประธานกรรมการบริหาร ไมเคิล เซลเลอร์ ยังคงยึดมั่นในกลยุทธ์ "HODL" ในขณะที่บริษัทอื่นๆ เช่น BitMine ก็เผชิญกับขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นจริงในสินทรัพย์ Ethereum เช่นกัน นักวิเคราะห์เตือนว่าความผันผวนของ Bitcoin เป็นลักษณะประจำในประวัติศาสตร์ของมัน และนักลงทุนระยะยาวยังคงมุ่งเน้นที่ความหายากและศักยภาพการเติบโตในระยะยาว แม้จะเผชิญกับความผันผวนของราคาในระยะสั้น65:T1505,Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has reported a staggering fourth-quarter net loss of roughly $12.6 billion, ranking among the largest quarterly losses ever recorded by a U.S. public company. The hit was driven almost entirely by unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings, underscoring how deeply the firm’s balance sheet is tied to crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business. Crypto Market Crash Erases Billions in Paper Gains The loss followed one of Bitcoin’s sharpest drawdowns in recent history . During the quarter, Bitcoin plunged nearly 15% intraday, sliding from around $73,100 to a low of $62,400. This move pushed Bitcoin below Strategy’s average acquisition price of roughly $76,000, flipping the firm’s position from massive unrealized gains into deep losses. Just a few months earlier, Strategy was sitting on more than $30 billion in paper profits when Bitcoin surged to record highs. Strategy Stock Feels the Pressure The market reaction was swift. Strategy shares dropped sharply after the earnings release and continued falling in after-hours trading. Over the past year, the stock has been down more than 70%, erasing much of the premium investors once assigned to the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since its November 2024 peak, the stock is now down nearly 80%, highlighting how quickly sentiment has turned. Bitcoin Exposure Magnifies Financial Impact Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, with more than 713,000 BTC on its balance sheet as of early February. Much of this position was accumulated during the late-2024 bull run, when Bitcoin briefly climbed above $120,000. With prices now well below those levels, unrealized losses have ballooned, making quarterly results highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s volatility. Saylor Stays Defiant as Critics Circle Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor showed no sign of wavering, posting a brief “HODL” message on X. However, critics have grown louder. Investors like Michael Burry have warned that sustained declines in Bitcoin could trigger cascading losses for corporate holders, reviving long-standing concerns around leverage and exposure to non-yielding assets. Ethereum Slide Hits BitMine Too Strategy is not alone. BitMine Immersion Technologies is facing roughly $8.2 billion in unrealized losses after Ethereum slipped to around $1,930, well below its average purchase price of $3,826. The company holds about 4.29 million ETH but has cushioned the blow by staking over 2.9 million ETH, generating around $188 million in annual yield, while maintaining strong cash reserves and no debt. Volatility, Not Failure Amid the turmoil, Anthony Pompliano offered a broader perspective, arguing that Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a flaw. He pointed out that repeated 50–85% drawdowns have defined Bitcoin’s history, yet the network has continued to operate flawlessly for over a decade. While critics celebrate downturns, long-term holders remain focused on scarcity, betting that short-term pain is temporary in Bitcoin’s long-term growth story. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own, and why does it matter? MicroStrategy holds over 713,000 Bitcoin, making it the world’s largest corporate holder. This massive stake makes its financial results extremely sensitive to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Did MicroStrategy sell its Bitcoin after the loss? No. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor signaled a continued “HODL” strategy, indicating the company does not plan to sell its Bitcoin despite the paper losses. Are other companies facing similar crypto losses? Yes. For example, BitMine faces about $8.2 billion in unrealized losses on its Ethereum holdings, though it offsets some risk through staking rewards and strong cash reserves. Is Bitcoin’s volatility a sign it’s failing? No. Analysts note Bitcoin’s history is defined by large drawdowns, yet the network operates flawlessly. Long-term investors view volatility as a temporary feature of its long-term growth story.

The move was backed by over $2 billion in long liquidations , wiping out more than $380 billion from the total crypto market capitalization. In contrast, the Decred (DCR) price has shown strong relative strength. The token surged over 30%, reaching levels above $24.65in the past few hours, even as market sentiment remained weak. The rally appears driven by a clean technical breakout, placing DCR among the top-performing assets over the past seven days. Price has moved above the key resistance zone between $22.17 and $23.40, a range that previously capped upside attempts. A daily close above this zone would likely validate bullish continuation toward the next target near $30. The key question now is whether DCR can maintain momentum and continue decoupling from the broader bearish market structure. Following the breakout, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, pointing to rising volatility as buying activity picks up. At the same time, On-Balance Volume (OBV) has moved sharply higher, indicating that more volume is flowing in on up-moves than on declines—often a sign of accumulation rather than short-term speculation. With demand building alongside improving volume structure, DCR appears positioned for a potential move toward the $30 level. However, for this bullish setup to remain valid, the price needs to secure a daily close above the immediate resistance zone between $22.12 and $23.51. Failure to do so could delay further upside and keep the Decred (DCR) price vulnerable to short-term pullbacks.

Crypto analyst Nathan Sloan of Investing Made Simple laid out the key levels to watch and why the 4-year cycle suggests this crash may follow a familiar pattern. After failing to reclaim $100,000, which flipped from support to resistance, Bitcoin flushed down past $70,000 and is currently trading around $65,845 . But this sell-off isn’t limited to crypto. Gold is correcting sharply, silver dropped 10% in a single day, and the NASDAQ is pulling back as well. Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Points to a Familiar Pattern Sloan highlighted that averaging the 2017 and 2021 cycle tops closely predicted the exact market top this cycle. That makes the 4-year cycle harder to dismiss as a coincidence. Bitcoin has now posted five consecutive red months since October. That has only happened once before, during the 2018 bear market, which saw six in a row. A relief rally is statistically overdue since Bitcoin has never posted more than six consecutive negative months. Historically, cycle bottoms have landed around October. Bitcoin Buying Levels to Watch Sloan outlined four price zones he considers important. The $70,000 level, the previous all-time high from the 2021 cycle, has already been broken. Bitcoin is now trading well below what Sloan considers a strong long-term entry zone. The $63,000 level, now less than 4% below current prices, would mark a 50% drawdown from the all-time high. At that level, simply returning to the prior high would mean a 2x return. The 200-week moving average sits just below $60,000 and is rising. Sloan flagged this as a historically reliable level. Every major crypto crash has either touched or broken below this line before recovering. “If you can get in between 60 and 70, if you can ignore all the pain and the fear over the next 3 to 6 months, you’ll likely do very, very well,” he said. Fed Policy Could Decide What Happens Next Sloan sees monetary policy as the strongest macro correlator for crypto. He compared the current setup to 2019, the last time the Fed pivoted, which saw a roughly 53% drawdown before recovery. Also Read: Trump’s New Fed Chair Kevin Warsh Could Cut Rates “Aggressively”, Says Analyst His personal plan is to buy back in around the $63,000 level within the next month or two, accepting the risk of being early. “The only downside for me is that I might be too early. So yes, Bitcoin could go sideways for months. It could even come down a little bit more,” he said.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction 2026 is becoming increasingly bullish as the 2025’s second half comes to a close soon, with all-time highs of $125K reached this year as the highest point. As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop. The year was marked by optimism, driven by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, skyrocketing institutional adoption, clearer regulations, and unwavering political support. There were several macro downturns, too, that capped BTC’s uptrend, like trade tariffs and wars. Despite that, BTC holds its level, making it now seen as “a hedge against inflation” more than ever. Major players, including MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and several other entities, are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. The market enthusiasm is at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction 2026 – 2030 dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. Coinpedia’s BTC Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, Bitcoin faced constant resistance, leading to a decline. By early February, it fell below the 200-day EMA, and now approaching $65K. If it drops below that, it may reach $53K in Q1 2026. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $60,074.20 and $71,584.86 today. Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $65,545.2449 -8.06% Market Cap $ 1,309,927,617,728.46 24h Volume $ 145,126,686,163.65 Circulating Supply 19,985,090.00 Total Supply 19,985,090.00 All-Time High $ 126,198.0696 on 06 October 2025 All-Time Low $ 0.0486 on 14 July 2010 On February 5, 2026, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply below $70,000, marking its lowest point in 15 months. This decline is due to a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets, large-scale liquidations of leveraged positions, and reduced institutional demand. The market reacted to the potential appointment of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair, leading to expectations of tighter monetary policy and a larger U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which increased above 97.5, lessening the attractiveness of riskier assets like Bitcoin. This situation triggered forced liquidations and a decline in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 11, signaling “Extreme Fear” among investors. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin cannot hold the $65,000 support level, it may drop further, potentially reaching targets of $60,000 or lower. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, the Bitcoin price retested the lower border of the ascending wedge pattern as resistance, with a slight bullish attempt that proved to be a fakeout, leading to a deeper decline. This is exactly witnessed in January when the fall worsened to $80738 January end,and early February even penetrated the 200-day EMA band and is approaching $65Ksupport area. Itis expected that if BTC/USD doesn’t take support and keeps falling, then odds suggest that beneath $65K, the Q1 2026 could see price falling towards $53K. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2026 $60,000-$95,000 $100,000 – $108,000 $115,000 – $118,000 Bitcoin Price On-chain Outlook The on-chain data has showed strong accumulation in 2025 and sustained declines in exchange reserves. Crucially, this confirms the elevated institutional commitment, which is evident even in the US Spot ETFs data figures and the corporate adoption also reinforces this trend, with public company holdings nearly doubling since the start of the year. Ultimately, a Bitcoin price prediction 2025 suggests that the future potential depends strictly on how sustained buying demand remains, as well as geopolitical stability and regulatory clarity. If the current bullish sentiment persists, the BTC price is expected to reach a cycle high target of $150,000. Conversely, should global uncertainty intensify and sentiment turn negative, the downside risk is projected to find strong support around the $70,000 mark.

Feb 6, 2026, 9:52 a.m. The U.S. jobs market is cooling fast, a timely blow that could force the Federal Reserve to loosen its purse strings and potentially put a floor under the price of bitcoin BTC $65,835.49 . Planned layoffs, the job cuts that companies have announced but not yet executed, surged by 205% to 108,435 in January, according to data tracked by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That's the highest reading since January 2009, months after Lehman Brothers collapsed and pushed the global economy into recession. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Year-on-year, the announced cuts rose 118%, indicating a sharp weakening in the labor market in the first year of Donald Trump's second stint as president. The technology industry announced 22,291 reductions, with Amazon (AMZN) accounting for most, while United Parcel Service (UPS) announced 31,243 planned cuts. Andy Challenger, workplace expert at Challenger, Grey & Christmas, called it a high figure for January, in any case a seasonally weak month for hiring. "It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026," Challenger said. This data clashes with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly payrolls report, which still paints a resilient labor market picture. Private reports are increasingly becoming early warning flags, signaling cracks forming before the official figures. Earlier this month, the blockchain-based Truflation showed a precipitous drop in real-time inflation, to under 1%, even as the official CPI lingers well above the Fed's 2% target. Together, these unofficial indicators suggest the Fed may soon need to relax policy by lowering borrowing costs to support the economy. The potential easing could bode well for assets like bitcoin, which is now down nearly 50% from its record high of over $126,000. The Fed this month left the benchmark borrowing rate unchanged in the 3.5%-3.75% range, while flagging concerns about inflation. Analysts' projections on what it will do next are all over the place. JPMorgan expects the Fed to keep rates unchanged throughout this year and then increase sometime in 2027, while other banks expect at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. An economist who correctly predicted Japan's fiscal issues expects Trump's nominee for Fed chairman, Kevin Warsh, to cut rates by 100 basis points before the mid-term elections in November.6a:T430,Bitcoin's slide to around $60,000 has created significant challenges for companies holding Bitcoin treasuries, with combined unrealized losses approaching $10 billion across eight major entities. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has been hit hardest with $6.85 billion in unrealized losses on its 713,502 BTC holdings purchased at an average cost of $76,047. Other heavily impacted companies include Metaplanet ($1.45 billion underwater) and Twenty One Capital ($906.7 million loss). Only one company, Next, remains profitable with a $179.5 million unrealized gain on BTC purchased at lower prices.

The situation is complicated by market-to-NAV ratios affecting these companies' abilities to raise capital during the downturn. With Bitcoin already 51% below its October 2025 peak of $126,000, potential further declines could dramatically increase losses - Strategy alone could face an additional $20.29 billion loss if Bitcoin drops to $38,000. This comes as Bitcoin ETFs experience net outflows, removing a key buyer bloc that previously helped absorb supply pressure.6b:Tb6d,การร่วงลงของราคา Bitcoin ไปที่ระดับประมาณ 60,000 ดอลลาร์สร้างความท้าทายอย่างมากให้กับบริษัทต่างๆ ที่ถือ Bitcoin ในคลังโดยรวม โดยขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นรวมกันเกือบ 10,000 ล้านดอลลาร์ใน 8 เอนทิตี้หลัก Strategy (เดิมชื่อ MicroStrategy) ได้รับผลกระทบหนักที่สุดด้วยขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 6,850 ล้านดอลลาร์จากการถือ Bitcoin 713,502 เหรียญที่ซื้อที่ราคาเฉลี่ย 76,047 ดอลลาร์ บริษัทอื่นๆ ที่ได้รับผลกระทบอย่างหนัก ได้แก่ Metaplanet (ขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 1,450 ล้านดอลลาร์) และ Twenty One Capital (ขาดทุน 906.7 ล้านดอลลาร์) มีเพียงบริษัทเดียวคือ Next ที่ยังคงกำไรด้วยกำไรที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้น 179.5 ล้านดอลลาร์จาก Bitcoin ที่ซื้อในราคาที่ต่ำกว่า

สถานการณ์นี้ซับซ้อนยิ่งขึ้นจากอัตราส่วนมูลค่าต่อสินทรัพย์สุทธิ (market-to-NAV) ที่ส่งผลต่อความสามารถในการระดมทุนของบริษัทเหล่านี้ระหว่างภาวะตลาดที่ตกต่ำ ด้วย Bitcoin ที่ลดลงไปแล้ว 51% จากราคาสูงสุด 126,000 ดอลลาร์ในเดือนตุลาคม 2025 การที่ราคาจะลดลงต่อไปอาจทำให้ขาดทุนเพิ่มขึ้นอย่างมหาศาล - Strategy อย่างเดียวอาจเผชิญกับขาดทุนเพิ่มเติม 20,290 ล้านดอลลาร์หากราคา Bitcoin ตกลงไปที่ 38,000 ดอลลาร์ สิ่งนี้เกิดขึ้นพร้อมกับที่ Bitcoin ETF มีมูลค่าสุทธิที่ไหลออก ซึ่งกำจัดกลุ่มผู้ซื้อที่สำคัญที่เคยช่วยดูดซับแรงกดดันด้านอุปสงค์6c:T21bb,Bitcoin's (BTC) slide to as low as $60,233 overnight, before recovering somewhat to $65,443, has left most of the largest pure-play Bitcoin treasury companies deeply underwater on their holdings, with combined unrealized losses approaching $10 billion across eight entities that collectively control more than 850,000 BTC. The reckoning hits hardest at the top. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, holds 713,502 BTC at an average cost basis of $76,047 per coin, resulting in an unrealized loss of $6.85 billion at current prices. That's a 12.6% drawdown on a treasury worth $47.4 billion at spot, but the company's scale means every $1,000 move in Bitcoin's price swings its paper position by $713.5 million. Metaplanet, the Japanese hotel firm turned Bitcoin accumulator, sits $1.45 billion underwater on 35,102 BTC acquired at an average of $107,716. Its 38.3% unrealized loss reflects the timing risk associated with late-2024 and early-2025 purchases made near all-time highs. Twenty One Capital reports a $906.7 million paper loss on 43,514 BTC purchased at $87,280.37, leaving it 23.9% underwater. The value considered is derived from a July 29, 2025, filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The dataset, sourced from Bitcoin Treasuries, tracks only companies whose business model centers exclusively on Bitcoin accumulation. Coinbase , Tesla , and other firms with diversified operations don't qualify, making this a pure test of conviction versus cost basis. Seven of the eight names analyzed are currently underwater. The sole exception is Next, which purchased 5,833 BTC at $35,670.09 and still holds an unrealized gain of 86.3% ($179.5 million). Bar chart showing unrealized profit and loss positions for eight pure Bitcoin treasury companies at $66,443.75 BTC spot price, with Strategy leading losses at negative $6.85 billion. The mNAV compression risk Market-to-net-asset-value ratios add a reflexive dimension to the pain. Metaplanet trades at an mNAV of 1.018, essentially in line with its BTC holdings, while Strategy's 0.784 multiple implies the market values its equity at a 21.6% discount to its Bitcoin treasury. Nakamoto, with 5,398 BTC and a 0.329 mNAV, trades at a 67% discount despite holding coins acquired at $119,729, representing a 44.5% unrealized loss. This divergence matters because underwater treasuries often need either premium mNAV multiples or dilutive equity raises to keep accumulating. In drawdowns, markets typically demand the opposite: wider discounts and higher hurdle rates for new capital. Companies that remain profitable, such as Next, retain optionality. They can hold, realize gains to fund operations, or deploy proceeds defensively. Names 40% underwater face a different calculus: holding becomes a forced bet that Bitcoin rebounds before financing windows close . Scatter plot mapping market-to-NAV ratios against unrealized loss percentages for Bitcoin treasury companies, with bubble sizes representing BTC holdings and showing Nakamoto trading at steep discount despite being 44% underwater. The incremental damage The current $65,443 price is 51% below Bitcoin's October 2025 peak of $126,000 , part of a broader crypto market drawdown that has erased nearly $2 trillion in value. Earlier this week, $2.5 billion in Bitcoin liquidations accelerated the deleveraging, and Financial Times noted rising prediction-market odds of a sub-$60,000 outcome. Stifel's technical models flag $38,000 as a cycle-style crash target based on trendline support. If Bitcoin sees a sustained drop below $60,000, a 9% decline from current levels, Strategy's incremental loss deepens by $4.6 billion , Metaplanet's by $226 million, and Twenty One Capital's by $280 million. At $50,000, those figures balloon to $11.73 billion, $577 million, and $715 million, respectively. A slide to $38,000 would impose an additional $20.29 billion loss on Strategy alone, beyond the $6.85 billion it's already underwater. Strive, holding 13,132 BTC at a $105,850 basis, would see its $517.5 million current loss expand by $373.5 million if Bitcoin hits $38,000. ProCap's 5,000 BTC, purchased at $104,219.34, would deepen its $188.9 million underwater position by an additional $142 million. Even Next, still profitable at current prices, would surrender $165.9 million of its $179.5 million paper gain if Bitcoin falls to $38,000, leaving it barely above break-even.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which accumulated aggressively through 2024 and early 2025, have seen net outflows in recent weeks as institutional allocators rotate toward safer assets. That flow reversal removes a key buyer bloc that previously absorbed supply pressure, leaving treasury companies as the dominant diamond-hands cohort. But “diamond hands” is a narrative, not a financing strategy. Companies accumulating via convertible debt or equity raises face rising costs and shrinking mNAV premiums.

You’re subscribed. Welcome aboard. Metaplanet's 1.018 multiple gives it equity-issuance capacity near parity with BTC holdings. Strategy's 0.784 means every dollar raised via equity costs 1.27 dollars of Bitcoin value on a look-through basis. Nakamoto's 0.329 multiple turns equity raises into a 3-to-1 dilution tax. Reflexivity trap The danger isn't only the mark-to-market loss but also the feedback loop. Underwater treasuries compress mNAV multiples, raising the cost of new capital, slowing accumulation, weighing on equity sentiment, and compressing multiples further. Companies with high cost bases bought into strength. If Bitcoin continues to fall, they bought into the top of a cycle. Twenty One Capital's $87,280.37 basis, disclosed in SEC filings, sits 24% above current prices but 13% below Strategy's $76,047 average. It becomes a matter of timing, not conviction. ProCap's estimated $104,219.34 basis and Strive's $105,850 cluster in the same late-2024 buying window. All three are now 36-37% underwater, meaning they would need Bitcoin to rally above $91,000 to break even, a 37% gain from current levels. What happens at $38,000 If Stifel's $38,000 target materializes, the aggregate loss for these eight treasuries would exceed $25 billion in incremental damage from today's levels. Strategy alone would result in a $20.29 billion hit on top of its current $6.85 billion paper loss, bringing total unrealized losses to $27.14 billion. Metaplanet would be nearly $2.5 billion underwater total, while Twenty One Capital would approach $2.2 billion. At that price, even Next would fall short of breakeven, erasing its $179.5 million cushion. The entire cohort would be underwater, with no optionality other than to hold and wait for a recovery that markets are increasingly pricing as uncertain. Pure Bitcoin treasuries bet that conviction plus scale equals compounding. When Bitcoin rises, leverage amplifies gains and mNAV multiples expand, turning equity into a call option on BTC with embedded financing arbitrage. When Bitcoin falls, the same leverage turns paper losses into financing constraints and multiple compressions into a reflexive trap. The current $65,443 price doesn't erase the thesis. Instead, it stress-tests it. Strategy's $6.85 billion unrealized loss represents 12.6% of its BTC value, a figure that would be tolerable if Bitcoin rebounds. If it doesn't, the question becomes: at what price does underwater become unsustainable, and who decides when conviction turns into capitulation? For now, the market has rendered its verdict through mNAV: premiums for profitable treasuries, discounts for underwater ones, and steep discounts for those without clear exit ramps. The paper loss leaderboard isn't static. It recalibrates with every $1,000 move in Bitcoin, and the next leg down will determine whether these treasuries are value traps or cycle survivors. Mentioned in this article Posted in6d:T1824,Bitcoin rebounded 11%, but $540 million long leverage raises 25% downside risk toward $48,800. Long-term holder selling surged from 2,300 BTC to 246,000 BTC, up nearly 10,500%. Exchange supply fell from 1.23 million to 1.22 million BTC, signaling early buy-the-dip behavior. Bitcoin’s recent rebound has revived the buy-the-dip narrative, but the data tells a more complicated story. After falling nearly 15% and briefly touching the $60,000 zone, the Bitcoin price bounced more than 11%, drawing traders back into long positions. At first glance, the bounce looks encouraging. However, bearish chart patterns, rising leverage, and fragile spot demand suggest the market may not be out of danger yet. With a potential 25% downside still in play, the latest bounce is now facing serious scrutiny. Bear Flag, Rising Leverage, and Falling Exchange Supply Signal Risky Optimism Bitcoin’s short-term risk is already visible on the 4-hour chart. Sponsored Sponsored After the sharp sell-off toward $60,000, the Bitcoin price formed a rebound structure that now resembles a bear flag pattern. This setup typically appears when the price pauses after a strong drop before continuing lower. If the lower trendline breaks, the pattern points to a downside move of nearly 25%, targeting the $48,000–$49,000 zone. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . Bearish BTC Structure: TradingView Despite this technical warning, leverage is rising again. Following the 11.18% rebound, more than $540 million in new long positions were built on Binance alone. This shows that traders are once again using heavy leverage, betting that the bottom is already in. Similar behavior has p receded major liquidations in past downturns. Long Leverage Comes Back: Coinglass At the same time, spot market behavior reflects a growing buy-the-dip mindset. Bitcoin supply on exchanges fell from around 1.23 million BTC to 1.22 million BTC between February 5 and February 6. This decline suggests that traders are withdrawing coins, possibly for short-term holding, expecting higher prices. BTC Supply Dips: Santiment Public figures and social media sentiment have also turned more optimistic, reinforcing the ‘Buy-the-Dip’ narrative. Sponsored Sponsored Buying $2,000,000 of btc at 67,000. Bookmark this. — Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) February 5, 2026 Together, these signals possibly show misplaced confidence. A fragile chart pattern, rising leverage, and early dip buying are forming at the same time. When optimism builds before structural weakness is resolved, downside risk often increases rather than fades. Long-Term Holders Keep Selling as Realized Price Support Comes Into Focus While short-term traders are turning bullish, long-term holders, the most stable folks, are moving in the opposite direction. The Long-Term Holder Net Position Change, which tracks the 30-day supply shift among investors holding for more than one year, has remained deeply negative since early January. On January 6, this metric showed net selling of around 2,300 BTC. By February 5, that figure had worsened to roughly 246,000 BTC. Long-Term Holders Selling: Glassnode This represents a nearly 10,500% increase in long-term distribution in just one month. In simple terms, the most conviction-driven investors are still reducing exposure. Sponsored Sponsored This behavior becomes more concerning when combined with the long-term holder realized price. The realized price represents the average acquisition cost of coins held by long-term investors. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or falls below this level, it signals deep market stress. In past cycles, major rallies only began after the price stabilized around this zone; however, not immediately. Currently, the long-term holder realized price sits near $40,260. Key Support Level: Bitcoin Magazine As Bitcoin moves closer to this level, more long-term investors approach breakeven. If the price drops below it, many enter losses, often accelerating capitulation. This dynamic played out in late 2022 before the final bear market bottom formed. So far, that reset has not happened. Long-term holders are still selling, not accumulating. Their realized price is becoming a key downside magnet. This suggests the market has not completed its full deleveraging and redistribution phase. Sponsored Sponsored Key Bitcoin Price Levels Show Why $48,000 and $40,000 Matter Next All technical and on-chain signals now converge around a few critical price zones. On the downside, the first major support sits near $53,350. A failure here would expose the $48,800 region, which aligns with the bear flag target and prior consolidation zones. If $48,800 breaks, attention shifts to the long-term holder realized price near $40,260. This zone represents the deepest structural support in the current cycle. A move into this region would indicate broad capitulation among long-term investors and confirm a deeper bear phase. Bitcoin Price Analysis: TradingView In a worst-case scenario, extended weakness could even open the door toward $37,180, based on longer-term projections and historical support clusters. On the upside, Bitcoin must reclaim $69,510 on a sustained 4-hour closing basis to regain short-term credibility. A move above $73,320 would be required to invalidate the bearish pattern. Until that happens, rallies remain vulnerable. With leverage rebuilding, long-term holders still selling, and critical support levels approaching, the current rebound lacks structural confirmation. Under these conditions, buy-the-dip strategies remain exposed to sharp reversals rather than sustained upside.

The cryptocurrency has avoided severe sell-offs that impacted many assets, and its daily chart now displays a classic bullish reversal candlestick pattern. This pattern, characterized by a long downside wick and strong buying near local lows, typically signals that sellers are losing control as demand begins to absorb supply. Additionally, a false breakdown from a tightening wedge formation has created conditions for a potential rebound as short positions close and buyers enter at discounted prices. Compared to Bitcoin, SHIB has shown resilience during recent market turbulence, maintaining its structure within a wider range while BTC broke below significant support levels. If SHIB successfully breaks above short-term moving averages (current resistance levels), analysts suggest a potential 20-30% recovery could be possible, though it remains uncertain whether this early recovery attempt will develop into a sustained rally or succumb to renewed selling pressure.6f:Tab3,Cover image via U.Today Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

After weeks of persistent downward pressure, Shiba Inu may be nearing a pivotal moment as recent price action starts to show early indications of a possible bullish reversal . Even though the entire cryptocurrency market is still brittle after Bitcoin's dramatic decline, SHIB has avoided the worst sell-off stages that impacted numerous important assets, creating space for a technical rebound scenario to emerge. Shiba Inu can reverse Following a protracted decline, SHIB has produced a traditional bullish reversal candlestick structure on the daily chart. With a long downside work and buyers stepping in forcefully close to local lows, the most recent candle demonstrates a strong rejection of lower prices. This pattern usually signals a short-term reversal or relief rally as sellers are losing control, as supply starts to be absorbed by demand. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView Additionally, the price action comes after a breakdown from a tightening wedge formation, where buying interest at lower levels swiftly overtook selling pressure that had initially increased. False breakdowns like these frequently serve as catalysts for rebounds when short positions are closed and buyers enter the market at a discount, trapping late sellers. HOT Stories It is not that bad Crucially, interest should also be paid to SHIB's performance in comparison to Bitcoin. During the recent market turbulence, Bitcoin broke below historically significant support zones, but SHIB did not collapse as catastrophically. In contrast, the token's structure remained consistent across its wider range, indicating that downside exhaustion might be nearer than many traders suspected.

Only time will tell if this early attempt at recovery develops into a more robust comeback or fades due to fresh selling pressure.70:T9bc,ACCM, a contracts for differences (CFD) broker focused on emerging markets, has entered motor racing, but not through the usual Formula 1 deals. Instead, it has become a multi-year sponsor of the Prima Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team.
Is MotoGP Going to Be the Next F1 for CFD Brokers?
Although a handful of other retail brokers have marketed their brands around top two-wheeler racing, it has yet to become mainstream like Formula 1. This also suggests that brokers can secure MotoGP sponsorship deals at a much lower cost than Formula 1 ones.
Although none of the Formula One teams or the brokers have officially revealed the financial terms of their deals, Libertex’s Chief Marketing Officer, Marios Chailis, said that the lowest-tier F1 sponsorship deal costs about $5 million.

“Partnering with Prima Pramac Yamaha allows us to connect our brand with a sport that reflects how modern trading works: fast-moving, data-driven, and powered by innovation,” said Tien Ching, CEO of ACCM, in a statement. This also highlights how the target customers of CFD brokers often align with motor racing fans.
Getting Exposure Is the Goal
ACCM operates under regulatory licences in Australia and South Africa, along with offshore licences in Seychelles and Vanuatu. According to SimilarWeb data, most of the brokerage’s website traffic comes from Vietnam and Thailand.
The latest sponsorship deal has made the broker the MotoGP team’s “Official Partner”, allowing it to place its branding across team assets and digital platforms. The broker will also gain access to a “range of other significant rights”.
The Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team also has a large social media following, with 560,000 followers on Instagram and another 560,000 on Facebook, meaning any promotion of the broker would reach a wide audience worldwide.
In addition, sponsor brands can gain visibility on MotoGP’s wider channels if placed well. These channels have more than 17.9 million followers on Instagram and over 7 million subscribers on YouTube.
While football and Formula 1 remain the top sports marketing choices for CFD brokers, many are now turning to niche local sports to better target their key markets. The number of broker deals with individuals and teams in mixed martial arts, cricket, rugby, and other niche sports continues to grow.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Robert Kiyosaki, a financial guru and the author of the well-known bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad, has posted a new tweet, engaging his followers in a dialogue about Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, rather than seeing a positive reaction, Kiyosaki faced severe criticism from the crypto community. Kiyosaki waits for new Bitcoin bottom to buy more In his tweet, Robert Kiyosaki mentioned four major assets that have been in the news a lot recently – gold, silver, Bitcoin, and the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. Kiyosaki claimed that he has not been buying any of the first three assets recently, stating that he had stopped accumulating gold at $300, silver at $60, and Bitcoin at $6,000. HOT Stories He reminded the community that recently he has had to sell some of his Bitcoin and gold, adding that he hates doing it. The reason is: “I hate paying capital gain taxes.” Although in an earlier tweet, Kiyosaki mentioned that he had done that to buy a new house. Now, Kiyosaki stated, he is waiting for new bottoms where prices would make it acceptable for him to start buying gold and Bitcoin again. He said that he would spread the word on X when he began buying gold and digital gold again. “I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold and Bitcoin, then I may buy again.” AS I POSTED on X earlier. I stopped buying silver at $60. I stopped buying Bitcoin at $6000. I stopped buying gold at $300. I have sold some Bitcoin and some gold. I hate selling because I hate paying capital gain taxes. Today…. I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 6, 2026 As for Ethereum, he revealed that he has enough of it for now but he plans to acquire more. You Might Also Like X crypto community bashes Kiyosaki However, the crypto community did not take this message positively this time. First of all, the Community Notes, a local fact-checking service powered by X users, accused Kiyosaki of lying. The Community Notes stated that Kiyosaki recently tweeted, saying he was buying Bitcoin – he published that tweet on January 23 this year . That was the tweet when he stated that he does not care about the price of Bitcoin or gold going up or down: “I just keep buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum and get richer.” Back then, BTC was trading at roughly $90,000 per coin. You're such a lying grifter holy cow. You've been pumping all 3 of these non stop daily for years and now you claim you were never buying? How you didn't win the financial charlatan of the year award, I'll never understand pic.twitter.com/gv6D9mNLM4 — Mark McGrath (@MarkMcGrathCFP) February 6, 2026 Several commentators also reacted in a similar way, saying that Kiyosaki should stop deceiving people or that there is no way to verify that Kiyosaki’s claims of buying BTC, silver, and gold at low prices, even though they sound quite impressive.73:T43d,Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows totaling nearly $1 billion over two days, with $434 million in net outflows on Thursday following $545 million in redemptions the previous day. These outflows coincided with Bitcoin's price briefly touching $60,000 for the first time since October 2024, leaving net weekly outflows at approximately $690 million despite Monday's $561 million in inflows. The ETFs are facing criticism for potentially undermining Bitcoin's scarcity by creating a "fractional reserve price system" where the same BTC can support multiple financial products simultaneously.

Total assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs currently stand at about $81 billion, with cumulative net flows totaling $54.3 billion. Meanwhile, altcoin ETFs showed mixed performance, with ETH funds experiencing $80.8 million in outflows, while XRP and SOL ETFs saw minor inflows of $4.8 million and $2.8 million respectively. The debate continues over whether the institutionalization of Bitcoin through ETFs has ultimately benefited or harmed the cryptocurrency's fundamental value proposition.74:Tb8b,Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to see outflows on Thursday, shedding almost $1 billion over the past two days as debate grows over their potential impact on the market. Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs recorded $434 million in net outflows on Thursday, following $545 million in redemptions the previous day. Monday’s $561 million in inflows was not enough to offset losses, leaving net weekly outflows at about $690 million as of Friday morning. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows since Monday. Source: SoSoValue The latest withdrawals came amid a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price, which briefly touched $60,000 for the first time since October 2024, according to CoinGecko. The community has struggled to identify clear catalysts for the downturn, and some have started to criticize Bitcoin ETFs even as analysts point to their resilience . ETFs face “paper Bitcoin” criticism The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was one of the most anticipated events in Bitcoin history, and was widely expected to accelerate BTC adoption through institutionalization. Some analysts, however, argue that the institutionalization of Bitcoin via ETFs may have done more harm than good, claiming it contributed to undermining the asset’s scarcity — a key feature of Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins . “The same 1 BTC can now support an ETF unit, a future contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, a structured note. All at once,” Bob Kendall, technical analyst and author of The Kendall Report, said in a Wednesday X post. “That is not a market. That is a fractional reserve price system,” he added. Source: Bob Kendall Kendall’s concerns echo those previously raised by his peers about Bitcoin ETFs becoming a tool for Wall Street to “trade against” Bitcoin. Before crypto ETFs launched, Josef Tětek, a Bitcoin analyst at hardware wallet provider Trezor, warned that such products could enable the “creation of millions of unbacked Bitcoin,” potentially depressing the value of actual Bitcoin.

This historic BRICS trade turnover achievement underscores the bloc’s growing influence as BRICS economic growth accelerates through strategic expansion and also deepening trade integration among member states. The BRICS trade turnover figures represent years of coordination between Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and the newer members who joined the alliance. Also Read: Dollar Will Fall As 40+ Countries Are Ready to Accept BRICS Unit BRICS Economic Growth And Global Trade Power Shift Source: iStock Experts are seeing the record-breaking BRICS trade turnover as a result of unique economic complementarity among member nations, and also through strategic integration. They have called this development “ a historic event that changes the balance of power in the world ,” according to reports from TV BRICS. The BRICS expansion impact became evident and visible as new members—including the UAE, Ethiopia, Iran, and Egypt—integrated into the bloc’s established trade networks at the time of writing. This BRICS global trade shift reflects broader changes in how emerging economies are coordinating their commercial relationships. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva emphasized the significance of the bloc’s trade performance at the BRICS Business Forum, stating: “In 2023, based on the most recent available data, intra-BRICS trade reached approximately USD 1 trillion—accounting for 20% of the bloc’s total exports and 30% of its aggregate imports. Accordingly, strengthening cooperation is deemed essential to advancing productive integration.” Member Nations Drive Record Trade Integration China remained the dominant force within the group at the time of writing, accounting for approximately 64% of the bloc’s overall exports, and also maintaining strategic leadership across various major sectors. India registered landmark achievements with total external trade hitting US$825.25 billion for the fiscal year. Russia’s bilateral trade with China alone accelerated beyond the US$200 billion mark for the third consecutive year in 2025, and its trade with the BRICS bloc specifically grew to roughly US$399 billion by late 2024. These individual contributions combined to push the overall BRICS trade turnover past the trillion-dollar threshold, pioneering certain critical benchmarks. The comparison between BRICS vs G7 economy now reveals widening differences in growth trajectories and also in overall economic momentum. The BRICS+ share of global GDP at purchasing power parity reached approximately 39.2% by late 2025, and this continues to surpass the G7’s declining portion in the global economy. Economists are projecting the BRICS economic growth rates at around 3.8% for 2025—which is more than triple the G7’s projected 1.1% growth rate, and this continues to surpass the G7’s declining portion in the global economy. BRICS Global Trade Shift Challenges Traditional Powers President Lula also addressed the broader implications of this ongoing BRICS global trade shift when he spoke about the role emerging economies should play, declaring: “In the wake of rising protectionism, it is incumbent upon emerging nations to uphold the multilateral trading system and pursue reform of the international financial architecture. BRICS continues to serve as guarantor of a promising future. The fight against inequality reinforces consumer markets, stimulates trade, and drives investment.” Future Growth Projections Show Widening Gap Source: Watcher.Guru The massive BRICS trade turnover milestone signals something bigger than just trade figures—it’s also reflecting a fundamental restructuring of international economic relationships and established trade patterns. The BRICS expansion impact extends into areas such as logistics infrastructure, digital economy development, and also regional connectivity initiatives that partners have prioritized moving forward. Also Read: BRICS: BCA Reports If the US Dollar’s Supremacy Will Last or Perish The gap between BRICS vs G7 economy performance is expected to widen further by 2028, with projections showing BRICS trade turnover continuing its upward trajectory. The bloc now represents roughly 45% of the world’s population and controls over 40% of global oil production following its 2024 expansion. As new members continue integrating and existing partners deepen commercial ties, the BRICS trade turnover influence on international trade patterns is expected to expand even more in the coming years.76:Te0c,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 In the current scenario, the key question is whether the market has actually bottomed. Historically, early bottoming signals tend to include investor profit-taking, clear signs of seller exhaustion, and an asset becoming deeply oversold. Is Bitcoin [BTC] exhibiting any of these signals? From a technical standpoint, BTC’s RSI is deeply oversold, dropping to around 15. This move aligns with Bitcoin’s roughly 33% correction from the $97k peak. Against this setup, BTC ’s 4% intraday jump from $60k hints at a potential local bottom. However, the key question is whether on-chain metrics confirm this view. If not, the bounce could quickly turn into a bull trap. Market questions BTC’s true bottom Despite early signals, the market still doesn’t seem fully convinced. On one side, analysts argue that Bitcoin’s current pullback is simply an “extension” of the 2025 bear phase, even though BTC printed a new all-time high near $126k during the cycle. So, what is this divergence signaling? By this view, BTC has continued to underperform since the start of 2025 despite the ATH, falling 33% versus the S&P500, 58% versus gold, and 26% relative to M2 expansion. Source: TradingView (BTC/Gold) In simple terms, analysts believe Bitcoin may now be carving out a bottom, supported by its 30% correction since early 2025. Under this view, the bear phase could be nearing an end, with $60k acting as a base for a reversal. However, skeptics argue that $60k may mark the start of a deeper move. Historically, Bitcoin bear markets have followed a pattern of deep but shrinking declines. If this trend continues, a potential 2026 bottom near a 70% drop from the $126k ATH would place Bitcoin around the $38k level. This sets up a key strategic question for the market: Are participants positioning to accumulate the “dip,” or reducing exposure before a deeper correction pushes PnL further into the red and extends the bear phase? Bitcoin’s recovery case weakens as structural stress builds The road to recovery for Bitcoin HODLers doesn’t look immediate. According to Glassnode data , more than 9.3 million BTC are underwater, the highest level since January 2023. Put simply, a large portion of holders are sitting on unrealized losses, putting market conviction under pressure. At the same time, Bitcoin has dropped below its estimated electrical cost near $77k. When price falls beneath this level, mining becomes less profitable , increasing capitulation risk during late-stage bear markets. Source: X Taken together, Bitcoin now needs a clear catalyst to absorb supply, reignite FOMO, and restore HODLing conviction among underwater holders. The key issue is that a strong institutional bid still hasn’t returned. From a macro perspective, this sets up a classic supply-demand imbalance, with available supply outpacing demand. Rising capitulation risk only strengthens this dynamic, further discouraging long-term holding. In this context, BTC’s structure doesn’t yet confirm $60k as a bottom. The result? Bitcoin’s 4% intraday bounce could fade into another fakeout, potentially triggering long liquidations and sending price back toward the $50k zone, keeping the broader $38k bottom thesis firmly in play. Final Thoughts Despite BTC’s 4% intraday bounce and early technical signals, on-chain stress, miner pressure, and unrealized losses suggest the $60k level is not yet a firm floor. Historical patterns and macro supply-demand imbalances indicate Bitcoin could revisit the $50k zone, keeping the $38k bottom thesis in play.77:Td4f,MYX price rallies 32% despite Bitcoin crashing near $65,000 levels. Strong spot inflows contrast with negative funding rates signaling trader caution. Holding $5.99 support keeps upside toward $7.49 resistance intact. MYX Finance has defied broader market weakness with a sharp rally, gaining strong upside momentum over the past week. The surge reflects sustained investor confidence despite Bitcoin’s drop toward $65,000. While demand remains firm, emerging resistance levels suggest MYX’s upside may face near-term constraints if momentum weakens. MYX Investors’ Inflows Counter Market Sell-Off Market indicators show MYX is benefiting from steady capital inflows.

The token remains above the $5.99 support, which has acted as a key demand zone. MYX has outperformed the broader market, with major assets posting losses. Sustaining this momentum depends on continued investor conviction. Ongoing inflows are necessary to offset derivatives-driven skepticism. The immediate objective for MYX is reclaiming $6.87 as support. Securing that level could allow the price to advance toward the $7.49 resistance zone. MYX Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risks remain if sentiment shifts. A renewed Bitcoin sell-off could weigh on MYX , even if correlation stays limited. Failure to hold current support may trigger a gradual pullback. Such a move would erase part of the recent gains and invalidate the bullish thesis and fall through $5.99 to slide to $5.27 or lower.

Rising liquidations boosted fees, revenue, and buybacks, creating unique downside protection mechanism. Coinbase listing and institutional access strengthened liquidity, though unlock risks remain ahead. Hyperliquid (HYPE) has moved against the broader market since the start of the year, supported by several internal and distinctive drivers. Analysts observe that liquidation losses have actually helped push HYPE’s price higher. How long can HYPE continue to outperform the market? Several on-chain and market data points offer a more nuanced view. Sponsored Sponsored Drivers Behind Hyperliquid’s Market Outperformance While capital continues to flow out of the broader crypto market, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has attracted inflows.

HYPE Price And Total Crypto Market Capitalization. Source: TradingView This divergence suggests that HYPE’s internal catalysts have outweighed the market’s heavy selling pressure. Recent reports from BeInCrypto attribute part of this momentum to a sharp surge in trading volume for HIP-3 futures contracts on Hyperliquid . Grayscale Research highlights a boom in perpetual futures trading for non-crypto assets on Hyperliquid earlier this year. The platform recorded a seven-day average trading volume exceeding $900 million. HIP-3 Futures Contracts Volume on Hyperliquid. Source: Grayscale In addition, Ripple Prime has opened institutional access to Hyperliquid ’s on-chain derivatives tools. This move supports liquidity and broader adoption. Sponsored Sponsored Another development strengthened HYPE on February 5, a day marked by the most fearful market sentiment in a year. Coinbase officially enabled HYPE trading , leaving the token largely unaffected by the broader sell-off. A listing on a major exchange like Coinbase boosted liquidity and demand. It attracted both institutional and retail investors. This allowed HYPE to absorb selling pressure and even extend gains while the market declined. “Coinbase is listing HYPE! There are two nuances for this listing: This is likely a precursor for spot HYPE ETFs to begin trading since Coinbase is the custodian. US investors still have trouble getting HYPE exposure; a Coinbase listing alleviates that.” — Steven.hl, Yunt Capital, said . Some analysts add that HYPE’s absence from Binance may be an advantage. It may help the token avoid widespread sell-offs. Investor MartyParty notes that HYPE is the only Layer-1 asset not listed on Binance. As a result, it has avoided being pulled into this “liquidity hunt.” Why Do Larger Liquidations Push HYPE Higher? Other analysts argue that HYPE’s price story runs deeper.

This figure was slightly lower than Bybit’s, but higher than Binance’s. Exchange Liquidations. Source: Coinglass Analysts explain that heavier liquidations tend to support HYPE’s price because of a fee-revenue-based buyback mechanism . High liquidation volume means higher trading volume, which drives higher fee revenue. DefiLlama data shows that on February 5, Hyperliquid generated $7.49 million in fees and $6.84 million in revenue. This marked the highest level since the market crash on October 10 last year. Hyperliquid’s Fee & Revenue. Source: DefiLlama Sponsored Sponsored For most projects, market crashes reduce revenue. Hyperliquid, as an exchange, benefits from liquidation activity instead. This dynamic directly impacts the price of HYPE. Data from Hyperscreener shows that more than 160,000 HYPE tokens were bought back on February 5. This was the highest level since the October 10 market dump. HYPE Amount Buybacks Per Day. Source: Hyperscreener This structure gives HYPE a unique mechanism to counter negative market pressure. “The recent uptick here is most likely due to a lot of liquidations, which tend to drive significant fees and revenue.” — Analyst Thor said . However, focusing too heavily on positive narratives may cause investors to overlook risks. On February 6, 9.92 million HYPE tokens are scheduled to unlock . In addition, negative market sentiment may persist and could outweigh HYPE’s positive catalysts. The latest analysis from BeInCrypto emphasizes the importance of the $30 level .

Daily UNI token burns hit record highs as Uniswap trading fees and activity surge. UNI price drops 15% despite whale accumulation and strong on-chain fundamentals. Bitwise Investments has taken a major step toward bringing Uniswap (UNI) to the broader financial market, filing an S-1 registration with the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) for a spot Uniswap ETF.

The proposed fund, if approved, would track UNI’s spot price, excluding expenses, with Coinbase Custody serving as the custodian . At launch, the ETF would not include staking, signaling a straightforward exposure product for investors. The filing coincides with notable on-chain activity. Daily UNI burns have surged sharply in February, according to Dune Analytics, alongside higher Uniswap trading fees.

This highlights confidence in UNI’s medium-term upside. However, analysts remain divided on whether the Fee Switch’s early performance justifies optimism. BeInCrypto reported in December that initial revenue from the Fee Switch fell short of governance expectations , with some analysts questioning whether the early data reflects flawed assumptions or simply incomplete rollout effects.

Most major altcoins, including Ethereum and Solana, have also fallen. However, despite the overall decline, a few tokens are moving in the opposite direction, drawing investor attention. Two projects in particular: Hyperliquid’s HYPE token and Canton’s CC token, have shown little gains while much of the market remains in the red. Hyperliquid (HYPE) rises on strong platform activity Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, has surged roughly 50% over the past two weeks, standing out during a period when many cryptocurrencies have dropped. The token’s rise appears to be driven by increased activity on the Hyperliquid trading platform. The exchange recently captured a measurable share of global silver trading volume shortly after listing the asset, boosting trading demand. Since all trading fees on the platform are paid in HYPE, higher trading activity directly increases demand for the token. Institutional attention has also supported sentiment, with major asset managers reportedly exploring exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings linked to the project. In addition, new integrations within other blockchain ecosystems have expanded trading access, improving liquidity and visibility. A recent platform upgrade allowing traders to hedge positions using shared margin has further increased trading efficiency, leading to higher trading volumes, rising open interest, and stronger daily platform revenues — all factors that helped push the token higher even as the broader market declined. Canton (CC) gains as institutional adoption grows Another token outperforming the market is Canton’s CC token, which recently reached a new all-time high and climbed more than 30% in recent weeks. Unlike many retail-focused crypto projects, Canton is designed primarily for institutional finance. Several large financial institutions are already building on or testing the network, including major global banks and financial infrastructure providers. The platform is also being used in tokenization initiatives such as digital government securities, strengthening its institutional relevance. A driver behind the token’s performance is its supply-reduction mechanism. Institutions using the network’s global synchronizer system must burn CC tokens during transactions, steadily reducing circulating supply. With hundreds of thousands of transactions occurring daily, this burn mechanism has created additional upward pressure on price, especially as institutional activity continues to grow.

The move followed Bitcoin’s drop to around $60,000, which triggered another wave of risk reduction and forced liquidations. In the latest flush, more than $1.85 billion in long positions were wiped out, setting a cautious tone for large-cap altcoins, including XRP. There was no XRP-specific trigger behind the decline. Instead, traders stepped back as volatility stayed high and dip buying remained weak. With leverage still unwinding and confidence shaken, short-term bounces in XRP have struggled to hold. For now, price action remains tied to broader market stability, with traders waiting for signs of exhaustion in selling before positioning for any meaningful recovery. Current XRP Price Position Today XRP extended its decline over the past 24 hours, dropping 9.77% to trade near $1.30. The sell-off intensified after the token failed to hold the $1.50 support, triggering a sharp pullback during the previous trading session. The downside move dragged XRP as low as $1.13, a level not seen even during the October 2025 sell-off, highlighting the severity of the breakdown. As the price slipped below $1.50, trading volume began to rise after remaining relatively flat near $4 billion since the start of the month. Volume spiked sharply as XRP marked its lows, surging past $10 billion and later climbing above $13 billion as the price rebounded. This increase in activity suggests bullish participation near the lows, with buyers stepping in to defend the range. The rebound has pushed XRP back toward $1.30, where it is now attempting to stabilize. However, upside momentum remains capped. Strong overhead resistance continues to limit recovery attempts, keeping bearish risks firmly in play despite the bounce from recent lows. XRP Price Analysis for this Week—Can XRP Still Plunge Below $1? XRP went through a similar sell-off in October 2025, when long liquidations crossed $612 million. The current pullback, however, appears technically deeper, even though long liquidations so far remain below $60 million. This imbalance suggests the weakness is being driven less by forced exits or external shocks and more by a clean technical breakdown and fading trader confidence. With liquidation pressure still relatively contained, sellers continue to control price action, leaving XRP vulnerable to further downside. Unless buyers step in decisively, the token remains exposed to a move below the $1.00 level in the near term. As seen on the chart, XRP has rebounded from the $1.05–$1.15 range, a zone where buyers previously stepped in during November 2023 and pushed the price toward a peak near $2.91. That historical reaction highlights the importance of this demand area. However, the current rebound looks different. Despite visible buying interest, XRP has struggled to move decisively higher and remains pinned close to support. More importantly, open interest continues to decline, suggesting the move lacks strong bullish backing. The rebound appears to be driven largely by short liquidations, rather than fresh long positions entering the market. As contracts continue to close even as price ticks higher, it signals ongoing deleveraging and a lack of conviction among traders. For now, $1.05 remains a critical line of defense. A clean break below this level could open the door to a deeper correction. Conclusion XRP’s recent rebound offers short-term relief, but the underlying signals remain mixed. While buyers have defended the $1.05–$1.15 zone, the lack of follow-through and falling open interest suggests the recovery is being driven more by short covering than genuine demand. Until fresh long positions enter the market and momentum improves, the bounce risks fading. For now, XRP remains at a critical juncture, where holding key support could stabilise price, but a breakdown would likely trigger renewed downside pressure.

This crash erased months of gains and brought prices back to pre-US election levels from late 2024. According to analysis from the Kobeissi Letter, this appears to be part of a structural market shift that began on October 10, when $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out, fundamentally breaking market sentiment that has not recovered.

The analysts note that Bitcoin's market depth remains more than 30% below its October peak, similar to levels seen after the FTX crash in 2022, and suggest a large institutional player may have been liquidated during this violent trading session. While the market continues to suffer, analysts believe we may be approaching a bottom when "structural liquidity is restored," which will require capitulation in both price and leverage alongside maximum bearish sentiment.7f:T10cd,Analysts explain what took place in the crypto markets in the past 24 hours or so, and whether the worst is behind us. It’s safe to say that this is no longer a bull phase. After all, BTC dumped by more than 50% since its October all-time high and plummeted to around $60,000 late on Thursday. But in this article, we will focus more on the events that took place yesterday than on the overall decline over the past several months. In the span of just 24 hours, the cryptocurrency plummeted from $77,000 to $60,000 in one of its worst single-day trading performances since its inception. Multiple altcoins registered even more profound losses of up to 20%, as was the case with XRP. The total value of wrecked positions in just one day shot up to $2.6 billion, according to Coinglass data. Nearly 600,000 traders were liquidated. Despite bouncing off local lows, BTC and the altcoins erased months and years of gains, returning to levels last seen before the US presidential elections at the end of 2024. During and after similar calamities, the most obvious question is why. Here’s a breakdown through the eyes of the Kobeissi Letter. What Happened? First things first, the analyst reassured that although bitcoin has plummeted by over $30,000 in the past couple of months, the “fundamental picture for crypto” has remained “vastly unchanged.” They added that the answer to why the asset class is tanking lies in the October 10 crash, when over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out . They believe “something structural” changed on that day. The answer to this question requires going back to October 10th. The most recent TOP in crypto came on October 6th, just 4 days before the -$19.5 billion record liquidation. Something structural appears to have shifted on October 10th. And, markets never truly recovered. pic.twitter.com/l07mKRBAbQ — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 5, 2026 Although BTC remained entirely rangebound for two months between November 15 and January 15, the analysts said there were brief periods of liquidation with “gaps” in both directions, which were another sign of the market’s structural collapse. They noted that sentiment is “all that matters” during crypto cycles, and it was broken after the October crash.

Analysts Explain Why BTC Just Crashed to $65K and Where the Bottom Lies “The result is a massive virtuous cycle, shifting from liquidations to sentiment deterioration, and back. Since January 24th, we have seen $10 billion worth of levered positions liquidated. That’s ~55% of the record amount seen on October 10th. It’s a structural decline.” The analysts offered more evidence showing the nature of the structural collapse, including the spread of selling pressure into other asset classes, and that BTC’s market depth, the capital available to absorb large orders, is still more than 30% below its October peak. The latest time it hit such numbers was after the FTX crash in 2022. Lastly, the Kobeissi Letter indicated that a large player, perhaps an institution, sold or was liquidated during the violent trading session, given BTC’s rapid and massive correction. Today’s decline was particularly noteworthy as Bitcoin fell over -$9,000 and selling pressure was constant. At times, Bitcoin would fall $2,000+ in a matter of minutes. It seems that a large player, perhaps an institutional investor, sold/liquidated during today’s session. pic.twitter.com/EWnLxUT1Vl — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 5, 2026 When Bottom? The second popular question after a crypto market collapse is whether we have bottomed out or if there is more pain ahead. The analysts answered that bitcoin would bottom once “structural liquidity is restored.” “This will be a combination of both capitulation in price and leverage, as well as maximum bearish sentiment.” The good news is that they added, “we seem to be somewhat near that point.” SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer).

Charles Hoskinson has lost over $3 billion in crypto but has chosen to stay committed, regardless of recent market losses, the founder of Cardano said during a Thursday livestream. “It’s easy for you to say, Charles, you’re rich. You can ride it out. I’ve lost more money than anyone listening to this, over $3 billion now,” Hoskinson said . “It’d have been real easy to cash out. Just walk away. And do you think I honestly care if I lose it all? Do you think I’m doing this for money? You’re pretty mistaken if you do.” Hoskinson emphasized that he is not motivated by personal gains and has avoided major scandals like the FTX fallout or the Epstein files by consistently turning down questionable opportunities and prioritizing integrity over access or influence. He previously criticized some industry leaders for accepting the flawed CLARITY Act in exchange for power, wealth, and elite status. Commenting on market conditions, Hoskinson encouraged the crypto community to endure the “red days” and focus on collaboration and continued development. “It’ll get worse. It’ll get redder. It is what it is. But at the end of the day, are you having fun? Find a way to. And know that each and every one of you in the cryptocurrency space, you’re doing something that matters. You’re doing something that has the potential to change the world,” he said. On Cardano, Hoskinson expressed optimism about the project’s infrastructure, governance, and future commercialization despite the downturn, with projects like Hydra, Leios, and Midnight showing development progress. Hoskinson co-founded Ethereum before leaving the project in 2014. He launched Cardano in 2017 through IOG with a focus on scientific research and sustainable blockchain design. In his remarks last night, Hoskinson also praised Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko as allies in advancing crypto adoption.81:Td56,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 The altcoin market has been crashing hard since last week.

The retracement was deduced from 10 October’s crash that saw ZRO create a flash low of $0.315. This suggested that bears had controlled this market for more than three months. LayerZero’s drop for the day extended the weekly losses to 15%. This figure put the altcoin behind only Ripple (XRP) and ZCash (ZEC) in terms of daily losses at press time. Momentum in favour of more downside seemed to be increasing too – A sign that sellers were willing to pull the price further down. The MACD bars, becoming denser as the signal lines crossed over on the downward side, confirmed this observation. This outlook suggested a potential revisit to the 50% retracement level, which coincided with a previous resistance zone. Here, things could change as bulls could come in and view this as a retest for the area. So, caution may be warranted here. Source: ZRO/USDT on TradingView Staying below $1.718 would heighten the chances of a drop to $1.45 or lower. However, these targets could also be viewed as potential reversal points, as they house both major bulls and bears. However, one question must be answered here – Is ZRO declining only because of its weak technical outlook? Retail traders may be selling hard… No. In fact, its on-chain activity has been giving similar vibes. As per data from Etherscan, ZRO has been dropping because of intense selling from retail traders too. A sea of orders worth between $10 and slightly above $100 has been flooding DEX platforms like Uniswap (UNI) . At press time, only a few trades were long – Insignificant in number compared to shorts. Source: Etherscan These findings are evidence of sell pressure from retail traders. Even though their volume has been usually small, they represent the sentiment of the general market. This might explain why the price of ZRO fell on the charts. Transaction activity on LayerZero sliding too! Finally, the transaction activity dipped below noticeable levels too. The number of transaction counts dropped by more than 70% in about three weeks – Down from 3,479 to 981. Additionally, the number of transaction amounts fell from 27.735 million ZRO to 8.137 million ZRO over the same period. Together, these observations suggested that activity has been sliding, accelerating the price drop. Source: Etherscan Here, it’s worth noting that according to popular analyst Benjamin Cowen, the near-term outlook for the market is bearish. What about the rest of the year though? Well, the analyst expects the same for Bitcoin (BTC). He claimed , “BTC goes down and drags the rest of the market with it. Good chance this process ends later this year, so stay tuned!” Final Thoughts ZROs price crashed by 10% on the back of a bear market structure and a fall in network activity. Some analysts expect the bear market to last through 2026.82:T47f,Santiment reports that extreme fear following Bitcoin's drop to $60,000 helped trigger a rebound toward $65,000, with potential for a rally to $70,000. This came after BTC experienced one of its sharpest daily sell-offs, dropping over $10,000 in a single day for the first time in history, with $2.2 billion in long liquidations. The analytics firm noted that spikes in social media negativity often precede short-term rebounds, though traders remain divided on whether this represents a genuine recovery or a temporary technical reaction.

The downturn has affected the broader crypto market, with major altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, Solana, and BNB also posting steep losses. Market data shows a mixed picture, with "smart money" taking net short positions while whales and public figures adopt long positions. Bitcoin is currently down nearly 9% in 24 hours and over 21% for the week, with analysts noting the current downturn is developing faster than the 2022 bear market. Despite the extremely bearish sentiment for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, some traders see the concentration of short positions as potential fuel for a move back toward $70,000.83:Tabe,Santiment รายงานว่าความกลัวสุดขั้วหลังจาก Bitcoin ตกลงสู่ระดับ $60,000 ช่วยกระตุ้นการฟื้นตัวกลับสู่ระดับ $65,000 โดยมีศักยภาพที่จะปรับตัวเพิ่มขึ้นสู่ $70,000 สิ่งนี้เกิดขึ้นหลังจาก BTC ประสบกับการขายลงอย่างรุนแรงในรายวันหนึ่ง โดยร่วงลงกว่า $10,000 ในวันเดียวเป็นครั้งแรกในประวัติศาสตร์ พร้อมด้วยการเรียกเก็บเงิน long position มูลค่า $2.2 พันล้าน บริษัทวิเคราะห์ชี้ให้เห็นว่าการเพิ่มขึ้นของความลบในโซเชียลมีเดียมักจะนำหน้าการฟื้นตัวในระยะสั้น แม้ว่านักเทรดจะยังคงแบ่งแยกกันว่านี่เป็นการฟื้นตัวที่แท้จริงหรือเป็นปฏิกิริยาทางเทคนิคชั่วคราว

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to around $60,000 earlier today before rebounding toward $65,000, following one of the sharpest daily sell-offs in its history. The move has split traders between those calling the rebound a temporary technical reaction and others pointing to extreme fear as a setup for a recovery toward $70,000. Fear Spikes as Bitcoin Rebounds From Sell-Off On February 6, Santiment noted that social media mentions calling for Bitcoin to go “lower” or “below” shot up after the drop to $60,000, a pattern the analytics firm said often appears near short-term price rebounds. The asset did indeed bounce back to about $65,000, with the uptick coming after what The Kobeissi Letter described as BTC’s first-ever daily drop of more than $10,000, alongside claims that a large leveraged position had been liquidated. “Is this nothing but a dead cat bounce?” Santiment asked, while positing that enough retail may have been shaken out to justify a quick rally back up to the $70,000s. The sell-off capped weeks of heavy downside pressure, as CryptoPotato previously reported, with Bitcoin wiping out gains seen after Donald Trump’s re-election and dragging most major altcoins lower. XRP fell 13% on the day, while Ethereum, Solana, and BNB also posted steep losses. Meanwhile, on-chain and derivatives data are painting a mixed picture beneath the rebound. According to DeFi commentator Marvellous, “smart money” has taken a net short position, while whales and public figures are adopting long positions. The market watcher argued the move looked more like a mechanical response after $2.2 billion in long liquidations than renewed conviction, noting that open interest remained elevated and funding rates had stayed flat.

Price Action Shows Heavy Damage Despite Short-Term Bounce Bitcoin was trading around the $65,000 level at the time of writing, down nearly 9% in the last 24 hours and more than 21% over the past seven days. Across the previous month, the losses stand close to 30%, pushing BTC about 48% below its peak from October 2025, when it surpassed the $126,000 mark. Analysts from CryptoQuant have said that the current downturn is developing faster than the 2022 bear market, with their data showing the OG cryptocurrency fell 23% within 83 days of losing its 365-day moving average, compared with a 6% decline over the same period in early 2022. Santiment added that sentiment toward both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) had turned “extremely bearish,” a condition that can coincide with short-lived relief rallies when retail fear stays elevated. For now, traders remain divided. Some see the concentration of short positions and fearful sentiment as fuel for a move back toward $70,000, while others have warned that without a collapse in open interest and prolonged sideways trading, the recent bounce may only be the precursor to another test of lower levels.

The token last traded at this price level in November 2024, when XRP’s price was just pick up steam. 2025 was rather bullish for XRP, with prices hitting a new peak of $3.65 in July. However, the asset has been on a downtrend since its 2025 peak, especially after the October market crash. According to CoinGecko data, XRP’s price is down 7.4% in the last 24 hours , 25% in the last week, 30.6% in the 14-day charts, and 41.2% over the previous month. The current trajectory has ignited fears among investors that the popular cryptocurrency could once again dip below the $1 mark. However, dipping below $1 could set the stage for XRP to eventually breach $5. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Source: WatcherGuru The crypto market downtrend was triggered by macroeconomic uncertainties and global geopolitical tensions. However, the liquidity crunch seems to have deepened the cut. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below its 2021 all-time high and could fall below the $60,000 over the coming days. XRP’s price will likely follow BTC’s trajectory. However, BTC seems to follow a pattern of hitting new peaks after a massive pullback. The original crypto fell to $15,000 in 2022, but rose to beyond $100,000 just two years later. XRP’s price will likely follow a similar trajectory. The next bull run could push XRP price to beyond the $5 mark. Additionally, XRP also saw the launch of several spot ETFs in 2025. We could see increased ETF inflows once the bear market is over and investor sentiment returns. ETFs have played a central role in the 2025 market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) hit new peaks thanks to increased ETF inflows. XRP could see a similar pattern in the future. Also Read: How Low Can XRP Price Crash In This Cycle? Hopes For Rebound Telegaon analysts also anticipate XRP to breach the $5 mark sometime this year. Source: Telegaon86:Ta23,Bitwise advisor Jeff Park has taken to the X social media network to outline a rather compelling theory for the recent cryptocurrency carnage. The recent implosion of crypto can be mainly explained by institutional risk management, Park argues. Multi-strategy hedge funds are likely responsible for the extremely aggressive selling. According to Park, they forced a capitulation to satisfy internal risk models. HOT Stories On Friday, the price of BTC collapsed to an intraday low of $60,255, erasing most of its ETF-driven gains. The "fast money" flush As noted by Park, roughly one-third of all Bitcoin ETF shares are owned by institutional players. Approximately 50% of that slice is held by hedge funds. This capital is "fast money" that gets deployed in delta-hedged or relative value (RV) neutral trades rather than long-term directional bets. "That's a decent amount of fast money flows that can capitulate if the cost of funding or margin requirements tick up," Park wrote. Hedge fund risk managers often intervene to "shut risk down" when there is a spike in volatility. Widening spreads and spillovers from growth equity correlations can force them to unwind positions immediately. "To sell when liquidity is as poor as it is is the typical 'shut risk down' behavior we're seeing today," Park noted The analyst has pointed to massive turnover in Strategy (MSTR) stock as further evidence of this institutional scramble. Volatility hits "code red" Park has noted that Bitcoin's implied volatility (IV) has spiked to 75%, a level not seen since the spot ETFs originally launched in early 2024. This is likely to be the main catalyst for this extreme forced selling. "This is the highest level since the ETF launch in 2024. It is also finally higher than gold volatility. Know it's a lot of pain right now, but this is all part of the process required for Bitcoin to make new highs," Park said. You Might Also Like For the first time in a long time, Bitcoin volatility is finally higher than gold volatility. This could end the "low vol" regime that had attracted so much institutional leverage. This is a classic case of "commonholder risk": distinct funds all rush for the same narrow exit door simultaneously. This results in "all downside correlation to one." A fast melt-up Despite the enormous crash, Park remains bullish on the medium-term outcome. He is convinced that the current pain is a necessary "process" to clear out the leverage and weak hands. "If that's true, and when this all clears, I suspect we'll reprice pretty quickly," Park predicted. "The melt-up will be fast."87:Tabf,Jefferies รายงานว่าแม้ Bitcoin และ Ethereum จะซื้อขายใกล้ระดับที่ดึงดูดทางประวัติศาสตร์ แต่ตลาดคริปโตยังไม่แสดงสัญญาณของจุดต่ำที่จะเกิดขึ้นเร็วๆ นี้ ธนาคารกำหนดลักษณะของการแกว่งตัวลงในปัจจุบันว่าเป็นการแก้ไขที่ขับเคลื่อนโดยสภาพคล่องมากกว่าการล่มสลายทางพื้นฐาน โดยระบุว่ากิจกรรมของเครือข่าย blockchain ยังคงมีความยืดหยุ่น Bitcoin ซื้อขายใกล้ระดับ $64,800 (ต่ำกว่า 47% จากจุดสูงสุดในเดือนตุลาคม 2025) ในขณะที่ Ether อยู่ที่ราว $1,900 (ลดลงเกือบ 60% จากระดับสูงสุดในรอบวัฏจักร)

In a research note this week, the bank described the downturn as a liquidity-driven correction rather than a collapse in blockchain activity, pointing instead to continued network usage and selective corporate bitcoin accumulation as evidence that the sector’s underlying infrastructure remains intact. STORY CONTINUES BELOW This comes as bitcoin trades near $64,800 , roughly 47% below its October 2025 peak of about $123,500, while ether trades around $1,900, down nearly 60% from its prior cycle highs. Jefferies wrote that sharp price declines have revived familiar “crypto winter” narratives, but argued that current weakness is more closely tied to broader risk-off sentiment in global markets and a rotation away from growth assets than to any deterioration in blockchain fundamentals. More than $2 billion in recent long liquidations has further amplified day-to-day volatility across major tokens. The bank highlighted selling from large bitcoin holders and persistent spot ETF net outflows as key near-term headwinds, suggesting institutional portfolio rebalancing is exerting greater pressure on prices than retail behavior. At the same time, Jefferies noted that smaller and mid-sized holders appear to be holding existing positions rather than aggressively exiting, while centralized exchange trading volumes and decentralized lending activity have begun to stabilize after recent spikes. Despite its cautious tone, the report stops short of a fully bearish outlook. Jefferies said longer-term catalysts such as regulatory progress, infrastructure maturity, and greater participation by traditional finance could eventually drive renewed interest in tokens tied to revenue-generating blockchains, leading to wider performance divergence rather than a uniform rebound.89:T4e1,MicroStrategy has clarified its financial breaking point if Bitcoin prices were to crash significantly. According to the company's CEO, a 90% decline in Bitcoin's price to roughly $8,000 would mark the point where the firm's Bitcoin reserves equal its net debt, potentially straining its debt-backed treasury model. At that level, MicroStrategy would likely need to consider restructuring, issuing new equity, or raising additional debt rather than selling its Bitcoin holdings immediately. The executive emphasized that such a scenario is highly improbable and would unfold over several years, providing time to respond.

The disclosure comes as MicroStrategy reported substantial unrealized losses of $17.4 billion in Q4 2025, highlighting the sensitivity of its financial performance to Bitcoin's volatility. Despite these challenges, the company continues to maintain its position as the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with 713,502 BTC, and has raised significant capital while building reserves to cover obligations. Executive Chair Michael Saylor remains firmly committed to Bitcoin as a long-term investment, though market analysts remain divided on whether the company's leveraged strategy can withstand a prolonged bear market.8a:Tb48,MicroStrategy ได้ชี้แจงจุดแตกหักทางการเงินหากราคา Bitcoin พุ่งลงอย่างรุนแรง ตามที่ CEO ของบริษัทระบุว่า การที่ราคา Bitcoin จะลดลงถึง 90% ไปที่ระดับประมาณ $8,000 จะเป็นจุดที่มูลค่า Bitcoin ที่บริษัทถืออยู่จะเท่ากับหนี้สุทธิ ซึ่งอาจส่งผลกระทบต่อรูปแบบโครงสร้างทุนที่ใช้หนี้สนับสนุน ณ ระดับราคานั้น MicroStrategy น่าจะต้องพิจารณาการปรับโครงสร้างหนี้ ออกหุ้นกู้ใหม่ หรือระดมทุนเพิ่มเติม มากกว่าที่จะขาย Bitcoin โดยทันที ผู้บริหารเน้นย้ำว่าสถานการณ์ดังกล่าวมีโอกาสเกิดขึ้นน้อยมากและจะเกิดขึ้นในระยะเวลาหลายปี ซึ่งให้เวลาบริษัทในการรับมือ

Executives stress restructuring or financing would precede forced Bitcoin sales in extreme downturns. Disclosure highlights leverage risks as Bitcoin volatility tests investor confidence and strategy resilience. MicroStrategy (Strategy) released its Q4 2025 earnings report and, along with it, disclosed an extreme downside scenario that would begin to strain its Bitcoin treasury model. The CEO’s remarks provided rare insight into how far the market could fall before the company’s capital structure comes under serious pressure. MicroStrategy Finally Reveals What Would Be Its Breaking Point as Bitcoin Price Drops During its latest earnings discussion, MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le said that a 90% decline in Bitcoin’s price to roughly $8,000 would mark the point where the firm’s Bitcoin reserves roughly equal its net debt. Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin Price Performance. Source: TradingView At that level, the company would likely be unable to repay convertible debt using its BTC holdings alone. As a result, it may need to consider restructuring, issuing new equity, or raising additional debt over time. Leadership emphasized that such a scenario is viewed as highly improbable and would unfold over several years, giving the firm time to respond if markets deteriorated significantly. “In the extreme downside, if we were to have a 90% decline in Bitcoin price to $8,000, which is pretty hard to imagine, that is the point at which our BTC reserve equals our net debt and we’ll not be able to then pay off of our convertibles using our Bitcoin reserve and we’d either look at restructuring, issuing additional equity, issuing an additional debt. And let me remind you: this is over the next five years. Right, So I’m not really worried at this point in time, even with Bitcoin drops,” said Le. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Le’s remarks come only months after the Strategy executive admitted a situation that would compell the firm to sell Bitcoin. As BeInCrypto reported, Phong Le cited a Bitcoin sale trigger tied to mNAV and liquidity stress. Speaking on What Bitcoin Did , CEO Phong Le outlined the precise trigger that would force a Bitcoin sale : First, the company’s stock must trade below 1x mNAV, meaning the market capitalization falls below the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Second, MicroStrategy must be unable to raise new capital through equity or debt issuance. This would mean capital markets are closed or too expensive to access . Therefore, the latest statement does not contradict Phong Le’s earlier position but adds another layer of risk. Sponsored Sponsored Previously, a Bitcoin sale depended on stock trading below mNAV and capital markets’ closing. Now, he clarifies that in an extreme 90% crash, the immediate issue would be debt servicing, likely addressed first through restructuring or new financing—not necessarily selling Bitcoin. Massive Bitcoin Exposure Comes with Large Losses Strategy remains the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, reporting 713,502 BTC as of early February 2026. The company acquired the holdings at a total cost of about $54.26 billion, according to its fourth-quarter financial results . However, Bitcoin’s decline during the final months of 2025 significantly impacted the balance sheet. The firm reported $17.4 billion in unrealized digital-asset losses for the quarter and a net loss of $12.4 billion. This highlights the sensitivity of its financial performance to market swings . At the same time, Strategy continued to raise substantial capital. The company said it raised $25.3 billion in 2025, making it one of the largest equity issuers in the US. Meanwhile, they also reportedly built a $2.25 billion USD reserve designed to cover roughly two and a half years of dividend and interest obligations. Executives argue that these measures strengthen liquidity and provide flexibility, even during periods of market stress . Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin Volatility Brings the Risk Into Focus The disclosure comes amid heightened volatility in crypto markets. Bitcoin traded near $70,000 in early February before extending successive legs lower to an intraday low of $60,000 on February 6. This shows how quickly price movements can reshape the outlook for highly leveraged treasury strategies. Strategy’s capital structure relies heavily on debt, preferred equity, and convertible instruments used to accumulate Bitcoin over multiple years. While this approach has amplified gains during bull markets, it also magnifies losses during downturns , drawing increasing scrutiny from investors and analysts. However, the company’s leadership maintains that the long-dated nature of much of its debt provides time to manage through cycles. This, they say, reduces the risk of forced liquidations in the near term. Saylor Doubles Down on Long-Term Thesis Elsewhere, executive chair Michael Saylor reiterated his conviction in Bitcoin despite recent losses, describing it as the “digital transformation of capital” and urging investors to “HODL.” Sponsored Sponsored Saylor and other executives argue that Bitcoin remains the hardest form of money and that the company’s long-term strategy is built around holding the asset indefinitely, rather than attempting to time market cycles. The firm has also expanded its financial engineering efforts, including scaling its Digital Credit instruments and preferred equity offerings. According to management, these are designed to reduce volatility and diversify funding sources while continuing to accumulate Bitcoin. Investors Split on the Risks Ahead Market reaction to the earnings disclosures and downside scenario has been mixed. Supporters argue that Strategy’s massive Bitcoin reserves, ability to issue equity, and multi-year debt maturities provide sufficient flexibility to navigate even severe downturns. Critics, however, warn that a prolonged bear market could still force difficult choices. Potential risks cited by investors include shareholder dilution, pressure on the capital structure, or the possibility of selling Bitcoin if funding conditions tighten. “The company is currently facing a whopping -$7.3 billion loss on their Bitcoin investments,” said Jacob King. For now, Strategy appears committed to its high-conviction approach. However, by acknowledging that its Bitcoin reserves would merely match its debt, the company has made clear that even the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin strategy still has a theoretical breaking point, one defined not just by market prices but by the limits of leverage itself.

This was underlined by the market activity, with the same suggesting that investors share a bearish outlook right now. This shift can be reflected in Bitcoin’s price performance too. At the time of writing, it was trading at around $71,000 – Down 44% decline from its all-time high. At the same time, market sentiment slipped into extreme fear too while liquidity across the broader crypto market fell. For now, the risk of a deeper pullback remains firmly in play. Investor exits are accelerating, order books show clear seller dominance, and there are few signs that downside momentum may be easing. Short-term holders amplify sell pressure Short-term holders are acting in line with historical patterns during periods of heightened uncertainty, but the scale of this selling raises Bitcoin’s capitulation risk considerably. Over the last 24 hours, these investors recorded their largest single inflows to centralized exchanges – Moving 60,000 BTC, worth approximately $4.27 billion, at the time of writing. Source: CryptoQuant More notably, much of this Bitcoin was transferred at a loss. This could be a sign of weakening conviction among short-term participants, while also suggesting that the prevailing distribution phase may extend further. When confidence among short-term holders deteriorates—especially given their dominance in daily trading activity—Bitcoin becomes increasingly exposed to sharp downside moves. Capitulation typically describes a phase where the price experiences a rapid and steep decline. Something like this often unfolds over one or two candlesticks as sellers overwhelm remaining demand. Miners add to bearish momentum The ongoing sell-off is not confined to short-term holders alone. Miners are also contributing to the growing bearish pressure. Miners play a central role in maintaining Bitcoin’s network by validating transactions and earning block rewards. While a portion of these rewards is routinely sold to cover operating costs, recent data might hint at a broader loss of confidence. Over the last three days, conditions shifted decisively bearish too. The Miner Reserve, for instance, dropped to roughly 1.80 million BTC, signaling a hike in cash-outs as miners reassessed near-term market prospects. Source: CryptoQuant This behavior can be reinforced by the Miner Selling Power too. This metric measures how aggressively miners sell relative to their total holdings. It surged to negative 5.4, confirming that miner outflows have been elevated, compared to the overall supply. If this trend persists, it could place sustained downward pressure on the price and further weaken Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Elevated selling dominates broader market Finally, on a broader level, Bitcoin’s exchange netflows have continued to climb over recent days. A hike in exchange reserves may be a sign that more Bitcoin is being positioned for potential selling – A pattern that has historically preceded extended bearish phases. In practical terms, a sharp uptick in Bitcoin held on exchanges means more supply is readily available to be sold on the market. Source: CryptoQuant If this trend continues, it would compound existing bearish sentiment, particularly as demand remains thin. Under these conditions, Bitcoin might just face a sustained risk of further downside in the near term. Final Thoughts Short-term holders have been selling aggressively, with roughly 60,000 BTC offloaded so far – Marking the largest single-day sell-off in the current phase. Miners are also adding to the pressure, as outflows increasingly outweigh incoming supply.8f:T13e7,Bitcoin’s crash to $60,000 has traders hunting for a hidden fund blowup Traders on X are pointing to everything from a Hong Kong fund blowup to yen funding stress and even quantum security fears as bitcoin’s plunge turns into a full-blown narrative vacuum. Feb 6, 2026, 6:52 a.m. Bitcoin’s plunge to nearly $60,000 on Thursday, a nearly 30% drop over 7 days, has got traders on X began floating theories that the selloff was not purely macro or risk-off, but various reasons that contributed to the asset’s worst single-day performance since FTX crashed in 2022. Flood, a prominent crypto trader, called it in an X post the most vicious selling he’s seen in years and said it felt “forced” and “indiscriminate,” floating possibilities ranging from a sovereign dumping billions to an exchange balance sheet blowup. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Few theories: - Secret Sovereign dumping $10B+ (Saudi/UAE/Russia/China) - Exchange blowup, or Exchange that had tens of billions of dollars of Bitcoin on the balance sheet forced to sell for whatever reason. Pantera Capital general partner Franklin Bi offered a more detailed theory . He suggested the seller could be a large Asia-based player with limited crypto-native counterparties, meaning the market would not “sniff them out” quickly. My guess is that it's not a crypto-focused trading firm but someone large outside of crypto, likely based in Asia, with very few crypto-native counterparties. hence why no one has sniffed them out on CT. comfortably leveraged & market-making on Binance --> JPY carry trade unwind --> 10/10 liquidity crisis --> ~90-day reprieve granted --> backfired attempt to recover on gold/silver trade --> desperate unwind this week. In his view, the chain of events may have started with leverage on Binance, then worsened as carry trades unwound and liquidity evaporated, with a failed attempt to recover losses in gold and silver accelerating the forced unwind this week. But the more unusual narrative emerging from the crash is not about leverage. It is about security. Charles Edwards of Capriole argued that falling prices may finally force serious attention on bitcoin’s quantum security risks. Edwards said he was “serious” when he warned last year that bitcoin might need to go lower to incentivize meaningful action, calling recent developments the first “promising progress” he has seen so far. $50K not that far away now. I was serious when I said last year that price would need to go lower to incentivize proper attention to Bitcoin quantum security. This is the first promising progress we have seen to date. I genuinely hope Saylor is serious about establishing a well funded Bitcoin Security team. He would have significant sway across the network in affecting change. I am concerned that his statement today is a false flag, to simply diminish mounting quantum fear without substantive action, but I would love for this to be wrong. We have a lot of work to do, and it needs to be done in 2026. Parker White, COO and CIO at DeFi Development Corp., pointed to unusual activity in BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) as a possible culprit behind Thursday’s washout. He noted IBIT posted its biggest-ever volume day at $10.7 billion, alongside a record $900 million in options premium, arguing the pattern fits a large options-driven liquidation rather than a typical crypto-native leverage unwind. The last small piece of evidence I have is that I personally know a number of HK-based hedge funds that are holders of $DFDV , which had the worst single down day ever, with a meaningful mNAV decline. The mNAV had been holding steady surprisingly well throughout this pull back until today. One of these fund(s) could have been connected to the IBIT culprit, as I highly doubt a fund taking that large of a position in IBIT and using a single entity structure would only have the one fund. Now, I could easily see how the fund(s) could have been running a levered options trade on IBIT (think way OTM calls = ultra high gamma) with borrowed capital in JPY. Oct 10th could very well have blown a hole in their balance sheet, that they tried to win back by adding leverage waiting for the "obvious" rebound. As that led to increased losses, coupled with increased funding costs in JPY, I could see how the fund(s) would have gotten more desperate and hopped on the Silver trade. When that blew up, things got dire and this last push in BTC finished them off. “I have no hard evidence here, just some hunches and bread crumbs, but it does seem very plausible,” White wrote on X. Bitcoin’s drop over the past week has been less about a slow grind lower and more about sudden air pockets, with sharp intraday swings replacing the orderly dip-buying seen earlier this year. The move has dragged BTC back toward levels last traded in late 2024, while liquidity has looked thin across major venues. With altcoins under heavier pressure and sentiment collapsing to post-FTX style readings, traders are now treating each rebound as suspect until flows and positioning visibly reset.90:Tc99,Friday has come around again, which means another batch of expiring Bitcoin options as spot markets continue to melt down. Around 34,000 Bitcoin options contracts will expire on Friday, Feb. 6, with a notional value of roughly $2.1 billion. This event is much smaller than last week’s end-of-month expiry. Crypto markets have collapsed into bear market territory, losing around $686 billion since the start of the week, as sentiment plunges and both retail and institutional investors dump crypto assets. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.59, meaning that there are more expiring calls (longs) than puts (shorts). Max pain is around $82,000, according to Coinglass, which is well above current spot prices, so many will be out of the money on expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, remains highest at $100,000 and $70,000, which have $1.1 billion at these strike prices on Deribit. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges has been in decline for a week and is at $32.5 billion. “BTC option flows suggesting downside plays not over,” said Deribit. “Bitcoin’s open interest is stacked through the $80K to $90K region, with elevated put activity showing traders leaned defensive into the move.” 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 At 8:00 UTC tomorrow, over $2.5B in crypto options are set to expire. $BTC : $2.15B notional | Put/Call: 1.42 | Max Pain: $82K $ETH : $408M notional | Put/Call: 1.13 | Max Pain: $2.55K Bitcoin’s open interest is stacked through the $80K to $90K region,… pic.twitter.com/WPCdYeS2aC — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) February 5, 2026 “The upcoming $60,000 range represents the consolidation zone prior to the Trump rally, where support remains relatively strong. Should a rapid dip occur in the short term, it may present a buying opportunity,” said crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 217,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $400 million, max pain at $2,550, and a put/call ratio of 1.15. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $7.1 billion. This brings the total notional value of crypto options expiries to around $2.5 billion.

Season 1: Horizon represents more than a limited-time promotion. It establishes the foundational scoring logic, risk controls, and reward architecture that will guide DipCoin’s incentive programs across future seasons. The system is built to align user rewards with meaningful platform activity (trading, liquidity commitment, position management, and referrals) while discouraging short-term manipulation and low-quality participation. With Horizon, DipCoin takes a step toward transforming incentives from short-term marketing campaigns into a structured, sustainable ecosystem engine. A New Chapter: Why “Horizon” “Horizon” symbolizes the beginning of DipCoin’s transition from a standalone perpetual trading platform into a contribution-driven ecosystem. Rather than focusing only on trading volume, Season 1 expands reward eligibility to multiple forms of participation, recognizing that healthy markets are built on more than just transactions. This season marks the first official deployment of DipCoin’s long-term points system, which will serve as a core reference for all future seasons and ecosystem benefit distribution. Season 1 Schedule All Season 1 calculations follow UTC time: Start: February 4, 2026 – 00:00 UTC End: March 20, 2026 – 23:59:59 UTC The DipCoin interface automatically converts these times to each user’s local timezone for convenience. What Users Can Earn Points For Season 1: Horizon quantifies real participation through four core activity categories inside DipCoin’s Perp Accounts and Vault Accounts : TVL Points (Deposit Contribution) Generated from average daily deposited balances. Trading Volume Points (Trading Activity) Generated from executed perpetual trades and Vault strategy execution. Position Holding Points (Position Size Contribution) Generated from average daily effective position size. Liquidation Points (Loss-Based Conversion Points) Generated when forced liquidations occur and result in real losses. Only Perp and Vault activity is included. Swap trades are excluded from Season 1 calculations. This design ensures that rewards reflect real economic engagement rather than surface-level activity. Early Bird Rewards: Honoring Early Supporters To recognize users who traded on DipCoin before Season 1 officially begins, the platform includes historical data as Early Bird Rewards : Included historical data: Trading volume points Liquidation loss points These historical points receive a 3× multiplier and appear in the Early Bird Rewards section of each user’s dashboard. TVL, position holding, team boosts, and referrals are not included in Early Bird calculations. How Total Season Points Are Calculated Season Points consist of four components: Base Points Boosted Points Referral Rewards Early Bird Rewards Boosted Points are derived from team participation: Boosted Points = Daily Base Points × (Team Multiplier − 1) Final Season Points = Daily Base Points + Boosted Points + Referral Rewards + Early Bird Rewards (accumulated across the season) Welcome Points for New Users New users who bind a wallet using an invitation code receive a 3-day Welcome Bonus : All Base Points earn 2x during the first three natural days. The bonus applies to: TVL Points Trading Volume Points Position Holding Points Liquidation Points If a user invites others during the Welcome period, the 2× bonus still applies on that day. From the following day onward, the user transitions to standard inviter status and begins earning referral rewards instead. Team Acceleration System DipCoin introduces a team-based acceleration model that rewards collaborative growth. Each user may: Create one team Join one team Users can simultaneously hold inviter and invitee roles. The system compares both team multipliers and applies the higher value as the user’s effective multiplier. Team Participation Requirements For a directly invited member to contribute toward team acceleration: Daily trading volume ≥ 2,000 USDC Daily average position size ≥ 500 USDC This ensures that team growth is driven by real traders, not passive or shell wallets. Inviters’ own points are not counted toward their team’s total. Referral Rebate Rewards Inviters receive: 10% of the Base Points generated by each qualified direct invitee. Only invitees who accumulate at least 20 Base Points are eligible to generate referral rewards. Referral rewards are additive and do not reduce the invitee’s own points. Post-Season Settlement After Season 1 concludes: Season data is frozen. Risk review and verification are completed within 7 business days . Final confirmed results are published and reflected in user dashboards. Season 1 points will be archived for historical reference. New seasons will start with fresh accumulation. Why This Matters Many points programs reward raw volume alone. DipCoin’s Horizon system rewards capital commitment, position exposure, trading activity, and community building together. This multi-dimensional design reflects how real markets function and encourages behavior that strengthens liquidity, depth, and long-term platform health. Season 1: Horizon sets the baseline for how DipCoin plans to distribute ecosystem value going forward. How to Participate Season 1: Horizon began February 4, 2026 (00:00 UTC) . Users can start earning points by: Depositing into Perp or Vault accounts Trading perpetual contracts Holding positions Participating in Vault strategies Inviting qualified users Users can learn more and get started at: https://dipcoin.io About DipCoin DipCoin is a decentralized perpetual trading protocol built on Sui, focused on delivering fully on-chain, non-custodial perpetual markets with professional-grade execution and transparent infrastructure.

AI-powered assistants, automated insights, and increasingly sophisticated interfaces now dominate product launches and marketing narratives. Innovation is often judged by the features traders touch, rather than by the systems that determine what actually happens when an order hits the market.
This creates a blind spot. In calm conditions, many platforms look capable. Prices move smoothly, orders are filled without friction, and spreads behave as expected. But calm markets can disguise meaningful differences in how trading platforms are built, supported, and engineered for scale.
When markets stop behaving calmly, those differences stop being theoretical. Surprise data releases, geopolitical developments, and sudden shifts in liquidity place very different demands on technology. Trading engines can look identical on the surface, but their behavior under stress depends on what sits behind them: capacity, execution locations, redundancy, and failover design. In those moments, innovation is experienced less through features and more through pricing coherence and execution quality. 
This is why the industry focus is gradually shifting. The question is no longer which platform looks most advanced. It is which systems remain most predictable when markets accelerate.
Technology that disappears into the experience
In many fields, the most effective technology is often the least visible. When something works perfectly, it fades into the background. The user doesn’t notice the engineering; they notice the absence of friction. In trading, we follow a similar logic.
Some traders may experiment with AI-generated insights or predictive tools. But what matters most in real trading conditions is simpler: execution that behaves consistently, prices that make sense, and systems that remain stable when markets become chaotic. 
This is where technology delivers its greatest value: beneath the surface, in how systems are designed, monitored, and refined over time. At Exness, improvements to pricing behavior, liquidity handling, and execution stability are initiated and shaped by people, engineers, product specialists, and analysts, who understand how markets behave under stress.
Data analytics and automation help teams stress-test behaviour, detect anomalies earlier, and refine execution logic over time. But accountability remains human-led. Someone designs it, someone monitors it, and someone owns the outcome.
Calm markets can hide a weak trading engine
Quiet markets allow fragile systems to operate without drawing attention to their limitations. Under these conditions, many platforms appear competent.
Take a trader entering a silver trade right after a high-impact event. With one broker, spreads widen to reduce broker risk, execution slows as liquidity deteriorates, and the order is filled meaningfully away from the intended level. With another, spreads stay tight, execution remains fast, and sufficient volume is available at the displayed prices to support clean fills. The trade idea may be identical, but the outcome diverges as the platforms behave differently under stress. 
This is what volatility reveals. Spreads may widen unexpectedly, execution can become inconsistent, liquidity may thin, and prices can gap. Orders that are usually executed predictably may deviate from expectations through slippage or delayed execution. 
Traders may interpret these outcomes as failure of discipline or strategy. In practice, the cause can be structural. When a trading platform degrades under pressure, even well-considered decisions can produce distorted results. 
Why trust is the real competitive layer
As trading technology grows more capable, trust becomes both more fragile and complex. Faster systems and increased automation can improve efficiency, but they can also make outcomes harder to interpret.
Many of these improvements are rarely visible. Execution safeguards and stability mechanisms are often understated. Their impact is felt indirectly: fewer disruptions, more predictable costs, and outcomes that better align with intent.
In this environment, trust is formed through experience rather than promises. Traders observe how execution behaves during volatility, how trading costs evolve under stress, and whether platform behaviour remains consistent when conditions change. Over time, predictability becomes a practical advantage.
Performance under stress is not only a technical question but also a commercial one. In volatile moments, brokers and liquidity providers face a choice: maintain competitive conditions and take on more risk, or degrade conditions defensively and reduce it. Traders experience this through spread behaviour and execution quality. The drivers sit deeper: risk posture, liquidity access, and the platform’s ability to handle stress.
Some market participants, like Exness, place more emphasis on how their systems behave under pressure than on surface-level features with limited impact on traders’ experience. This reflects a wider industry discussion: features matter less when they do not translate into better execution, more reliable pricing, or lower friction.
The most valuable uses, including AI, are those that reduce a user’s cognitive and production load. In other words, they strengthen understanding, not substitute judgment. Technology is at its most effective when it simplifies the complex and reinforces autonomy, rather than overriding it. Ultimately, the value of any tool must be measured by its outcome: does it lead to more reliable pricing, lower friction, and a more resilient decision-making process?.
The structural foundations of execution under stress
Designing systems for volatile conditions requires a different architectural focus. 
One priority is the integration of pricing and execution. When quoting and order routing operate as one coherent mechanism, prices are more likely to reflect tradable conditions and execution is more likely to align with what traders expect at entry.
Another is liquidity at scale. Depth becomes most visible when volatility increases and order sizes grow. A platform that can absorb larger trades without amplifying market impact helps preserve pricing integrity under stress.
A third consideration is resilience and monitoring. Reliability is built into the architecture: geographically distributed execution locations to reduce latency, redundant routes to avoid single points of failure, and automated failover so the platform can keep operating even if one component degrades. But architecture alone is not enough. Continuous monitoring is what makes reliability operational, tracking server loads, latency, rejection rates, slippage, and price behaviour so stress is detected early and capacity can be rebalanced before it shows up for traders as wider spreads, delayed fills, or inconsistent pricing.
Finally, there is a structural divide between platforms that are largely outsourced and those engineered in-house. Many brokers rely on ready-made third-party systems: fast to implement, easy to integrate, sufficient in normal conditions. But the trade-off is flexibility to improve. Performance depends on how the external solution handles routing, liquidity access, and volatility.
Brokers with scale often invest in in-house technology to retain control over those key components. It allows them to fine-tune behaviour under volatility and maintain consistent performance when conditions stop being predictable.
Build for the moments that matter
Many visible AI features are designed for stable conditions, where execution quality is treated as given. In calm environments, speed and convenience are a given. But when volatility rises, assumptions break: spreads degrade, liquidity thins, and execution becomes the differentiator.
At that point, real innovation is less about what the interface claims to do and more about whether the platform maintains coherent pricing and predictable fills when the market accelerates.
As the industry integrates increasingly powerful tools, the question becomes less about whether AI is present and more about how it is applied. A trading platform designed with stress in mind does not eliminate uncertainty, but it can change how that uncertainty is experienced. Over time, that distinction will shape how traders evaluate platforms, and how trust is earned.

Orders that are usually executed predictably may deviate from expectations through slippage or delayed execution. Traders may interpret these outcomes as failure of discipline or strategy. In practice, the cause can be structural. When a trading platform degrades under pressure, even well-considered decisions can produce distorted results. Why trust is the real competitive layer As trading technology grows more capable, trust becomes both more fragile and complex. Faster systems and increased automation can improve efficiency, but they can also make outcomes harder to interpret. Many of these improvements are rarely visible. Execution safeguards and stability mechanisms are often understated. Their impact is felt indirectly: fewer disruptions, more predictable costs, and outcomes that better align with intent. In this environment, trust is formed through experience rather than promises. Traders observe how execution behaves during volatility, how trading costs evolve under stress, and whether platform behaviour remains consistent when conditions change. Over time, predictability becomes a practical advantage. Performance under stress is not only a technical question but also a commercial one. In volatile moments, brokers and liquidity providers face a choice: maintain competitive conditions and take on more risk, or degrade conditions defensively and reduce it. Traders experience this through spread behaviour and execution quality. The drivers sit deeper: risk posture, liquidity access, and the platform’s ability to handle stress. Some market participants, like Exness, place more emphasis on how their systems behave under pressure than on surface-level features with limited impact on traders’ experience. This reflects a wider industry discussion: features matter less when they do not translate into better execution, more reliable pricing, or lower friction. The most valuable uses, including AI, are those that reduce a user’s cognitive and production load. In other words, they strengthen understanding, not substitute judgment. Technology is at its most effective when it simplifies the complex and reinforces autonomy, rather than overriding it. Ultimately, the value of any tool must be measured by its outcome: does it lead to more reliable pricing, lower friction, and a more resilient decision-making process?. The structural foundations of execution under stress Designing systems for volatile conditions requires a different architectural focus. One priority is the integration of pricing and execution. When quoting and order routing operate as one coherent mechanism, prices are more likely to reflect tradable conditions and execution is more likely to align with what traders expect at entry. Another is liquidity at scale. Depth becomes most visible when volatility increases and order sizes grow. A platform that can absorb larger trades without amplifying market impact helps preserve pricing integrity under stress. A third consideration is resilience and monitoring. Reliability is built into the architecture: geographically distributed execution locations to reduce latency, redundant routes to avoid single points of failure, and automated failover so the platform can keep operating even if one component degrades. But architecture alone is not enough. Continuous monitoring is what makes reliability operational, tracking server loads, latency, rejection rates, slippage, and price behaviour so stress is detected early and capacity can be rebalanced before it shows up for traders as wider spreads, delayed fills, or inconsistent pricing. Finally, there is a structural divide between platforms that are largely outsourced and those engineered in-house. Many brokers rely on ready-made third-party systems: fast to implement, easy to integrate, sufficient in normal conditions. But the trade-off is flexibility to improve. Performance depends on how the external solution handles routing, liquidity access, and volatility. Brokers with scale often invest in in-house technology to retain control over those key components. It allows them to fine-tune behaviour under volatility and maintain consistent performance when conditions stop being predictable. Build for the moments that matter Many visible AI features are designed for stable conditions, where execution quality is treated as given. In calm environments, speed and convenience are a given. But when volatility rises, assumptions break: spreads degrade, liquidity thins, and execution becomes the differentiator. At that point, real innovation is less about what the interface claims to do and more about whether the platform maintains coherent pricing and predictable fills when the market accelerates. As the industry integrates increasingly powerful tools, the question becomes less about whether AI is present and more about how it is applied. A trading platform designed with stress in mind does not eliminate uncertainty, but it can change how that uncertainty is experienced. Over time, that distinction will shape how traders evaluate platforms, and how trust is earned.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

While XRP has declined with the broader market, its structure and trader behavior suggest it may be undergoing a controlled reset rather than a breakdown. A key question emerges: if Bitcoin falls further, is XRP better positioned to recover first? There's a sentiment divergence between Bitcoin and XRP, with Bitcoin sentiment turning extremely bearish while XRP maintains relatively more optimistic outlook. Historical patterns show markets typically move against retail emotional bias, suggesting XRP may be closer to sentiment exhaustion than Bitcoin. ETF flow data reveals Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing significant outflows ($258M and $72M respectively), while XRP ETFs recorded $1.28M in net inflows with $79.2M in trading volume. This indicates institutional rotation rather than abandonment for XRP. Technically, XRP is testing the $1.30 support level - if it holds this level, a relief move toward $1.45-$1.50 is possible, with $2.00 coming back into focus as a medium-term objective.97:T1731,Crypto markets remain under pressure as Bitcoin struggles to regain footing, with downside risks increasingly centered around the $50,000 level. Risk appetite has thinned, ETF outflows have accelerated, and trader confidence across majors like Bitcoin and Ethereum continues to erode. XRP has not been immune to the sell-off. The price has moved lower alongside the broader market, reflecting its correlation with Bitcoin during risk-off phases. However, beneath the surface, the structure of XRP’s price decline, and the behaviour of traders around it tells a different story. While Bitcoin appears to be grappling with sentiment capitulation, XRP’s on-chain and positioning data suggest the asset may be undergoing a controlled reset rather than a breakdown. That divergence raises a key question for the coming weeks: If Bitcoin price falls further, is XRP price better positioned to recover first? Sentiment Divergence: Bitcoin Capitulates While XRP Holds Its Ground Recent data highlights a growing emotional gap between Bitcoin and XRP traders. Following last week’s sharp drawdown, sentiment toward Bitcoin has turned extremely bearish, a level typically associated with fear-driven selling and loss of conviction among retail participants. Ethereum sentiment has tracked a similar path, reinforcing the idea that broader market confidence remains fragile. XRP, however, is showing a more constructive profile. 📊 Sentiment has turned extremely bearish toward Bitcoin and Ethereum following crypto's major downswing this past week. XRP is seeing a more optimistic outlook among traders. 😱 As we know, markets move opposite to the fear & greed of retail traders. There remains a strong… pic.twitter.com/1U23pQ48D6 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 4, 2026 Despite price weakness, sentiment around XRP remains comparatively optimistic. This does not signal immediate bullish momentum, but it does indicate that traders are not rushing to abandon positions. Historically, this type of sentiment divergence often emerges near local bottoms, especially when broader markets are still dominated by fear. Markets tend to move against the prevailing emotional bias of retail traders. With Bitcoin sentiment approaching extremes, XRP’s relative resilience suggests it may be closer to sentiment exhaustion than escalation, a condition that often precedes stabilization or short-term relief rallies. The ETF Story the Market Isn’t Talking About While crypto prices remain under pressure, ETF flow data is quietly sending a message that doesn’t fully match the fear visible on Bitcoin’s chart. As Bitcoin slid lower, BTC spot ETFs saw roughly $258 million in net outflows, extending a clear pattern of institutional de-risking. Ethereum followed the same path, with around $72 million in outflows, reinforcing the view that large allocators are cutting exposure to high-beta majors rather than rotating deeper into risk. XRP, however, told a different story. Despite trading lower on the day, XRP-focused ETFs recorded net inflows of about $1.28 million, a modest figure, but notable in a market where capital was largely exiting elsewhere. More telling was activity: XRP ETF trading volume surged to nearly $79.2 million, pointing to active positioning rather than passive holding. Bitwise led the flow with roughly $40.6 million in volume, alongside participation from Franklin Templeton and Canary Capital. The takeaway isn’t outright bullishness but rotation, not abandonment. While Bitcoin and Ethereum absorb most of the selling pressure, XRP appears to be quietly holding institutional interest, even as the broader market remains cautious. XRP Price Prediction: Can XRP Hold $1.30 and Turn the Trend Back Up? XRP’s recent sell-off has been sharp, but it has now brought price into a zone that traders have been watching closely for weeks. The $1.30 region is not just a psychological level, it aligns with a broader demand area that previously acted as a springboard during earlier corrective phases. The current decline appears driven more by broader market weakness and Bitcoin-led risk aversion than by XRP-specific deterioration. On the chart, XRP has unwound from its rising structure and slid into this demand pocket after a steady sequence of lower highs. If XRP manages to hold above $1.30 on a daily closing basis, the structure opens the door for a relief move back toward the $1.45–$1.50 zone, where prior breakdowns and short-term supply are stacked. A successful reclaim of that range would shift the narrative from correction to stabilization, with $2.00 coming back into focus as a medium-term objective rather than a distant upside. Meanwhile, a clean break of $1.20 would expose XRP to a deeper downside toward the $1.15–$1.20 region, where the next meaningful demand sits.

Long-term holder NUPL at -0.19 remains above historic bottoms near -0.31. Coin activity surged 150%, signaling continued distribution pressure. XRP price has started showing early signs of stabilization after a sharp sell-off over the past 24 hours. The token recently broke down from its long-term falling channel and briefly slipped below its realized price, a level that reflects the average cost of all circulating coins. After dropping toward $1.11, XRP has rebounded toward the $1.30 area. On the surface, this looks like a strong bounce. In past cycles, similar conditions have appeared close to major turning points. However, historical data shows that XRP often spends long periods consolidating around these levels before a true recovery begins. Current on-chain and technical indicators suggest that while selling pressure is rising, the market may not have fully reset yet. Breakdown From the Falling Channel Pushes XRP Into a High-Risk Zone XRP’s decline accelerated between February 4 and February 6, when the price broke decisively below its falling channel. This channel had guided price lower since mid-2025, forming a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows. Sponsored Sponsored After losing the lower trendline support, XRP slid toward its projected downside zone near $0.93 and briefly touched $1.11. Although price has bounced since then, the broader structure remains weak. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . XRP Price Structure: TradingView Similar breakdowns in past cycles have rarely marked immediate bottoms and immediate recoveries. Realized Price History Shows Why This “Bottom Zone” Can Last for Years In mid-2022, XRP lost major support, the realized price line, and entered a prolonged bearish phase. After that breakdown, the price continued drifting lower and sideways for more than two years before the late-2024 rally began. This pattern shows that large structural breaks usually lead to long stabilization phases, not instant reversals. The current rebound toward $1.30 has not yet changed that pattern. During the recent sell-off, XRP briefly fell below its realized price, which currently stands near $1.47. Realized price represents the average purchase cost of all circulating tokens. When the market price trades below this level, most holders are sitting at a loss. This condition often marks periods of financial stress, but not necessarily final bottoms. Sponsored Sponsored Realized Price Line Breached: Glassnode A clear example comes from 2022. In June 2022, XRP traded near $0.31 while its realized price was close to $0.56. That represented a decline of nearly 46% below the realized price. Despite this deep discount, XRP did not start a bull market. Instead, it entered a prolonged bear phase. From mid-2022 through November 2024, XRP repeatedly traded close to its realized price, often closing just above or below it. This “hugging the line” phase lasted more than two years. Only after this extended period of consolidation did the major rally toward $3.54 begin. Compared to that cycle, today’s situation looks milder. Historical Realized Price Breach: Glassnode Current price near $1.21–$1.30 is only about 18% to 25% below the $1.47 realized price. In 2022, the discount was almost double that. This suggests that stress is building, but full long-term capitulation has likely not occurred yet. Sponsored Sponsored Long-Term Holder Behavior Supports The ‘Realized Price’ Angle Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss, or NUPL, currently sits near -0.19. This shows that many long-term XRP holders are now at a loss. However, during major cycle bottoms, this metric has historically fallen deeper, even to around -0.31 (in early 2023), before stabilizing. Long Term Holder NUPL: Glassnode So while holders are under pressure, past cycles suggest this phase may still have room to develop. At the same time, spent coin activity has surged. Since February 4, the spent coins age band metric, showcasing distribution-linked coin activity, has risen from about 79 million to more than 198 million, a 150% surge. This indicates that previously inactive coins are moving, often toward exchanges. In strong bottoming phases, this metric usually declines as selling dries up. The current spike, visible even after the price crash, suggests distribution is still ongoing. Coin Activity Surges Again: Santiment A similar surge in early February was followed by another leg down, reinforcing that repositioning is not finished. Sponsored Sponsored Together, realized price history, NUPL, and rising coin movement show that XRP is in a stress zone, not yet in a confirmed accumulation phase. XRP Price Structure Shows Why $0.93 Remains the Key Test All of these on-chain signals feed back into the price structure. XRP remains below its broken channel and below the realized price. This keeps downside risks elevated. The next major support sits near $0.93. This level aligns with channel projections and Fibonacci retracement zones, making it a critical area where buyers may attempt to defend the price. If $0.93 fails, the next major downside zone appears near $0.52, which served as a long-term base during the 2022–2023 bear market. XRP Price Analysis: TradingView On the upside, the XRP price must first reclaim $1.47 to restore holder confidence. A move above $1.69 and $1.97 would be needed to improve the medium-term structure. Until the realized price is reclaimed while NUPL stabilizes and spent-coin activity remains low for a significant period, all XRP price bounces are likely to face renewed selling pressure.

It plummeted more than 20% in the day’s trading session, sparking concerns among the investor community. Its price is now at the $1.20 level and is flirting with falling below the $1 mark. Source: Coingecko If Ripple’s XRP goes below $1, it could take months, if not years, to get back to its previous highs. For context, the altcoin climbed above $3 in 2018 and fell below $1 for nearly seven years. If the cycle repeats, it could reclaim $3 only after this decade. The move could erode investors’ confidence in the cryptocurrency market and make them pivot to other forms of investment. Also Read: How Low Can XRP Price Crash In This Cycle? Hopes For Rebound Ripple XRP Dips To Dangerous Lows Source: Reddit Ripple’s XRP has already lost 50% of its value in a year , and 46% of the decline occurred in just a month in 2026. The year mostly started on the back foot, with leading cryptocurrencies plunging deep into the red. Traders who wanted to earn quick money are having a tough time in the digital assets market this year around. The stock market, despite all the naunces of tariffs and trade wars, is doing much better than expected. Dow Jones is up 1.3% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 index is trading on the razor’s edge. The market has been affected this month due to earnings calls from various companies. An investment in the stock market could have generated more returns than Ripple’s XRP year-to-date.

BTC is down more than 10% early Friday and has dipped to the $65,000 level. It is now down to its 2021 all-time high of $69,869. The extreme fall has not only affected retail investors, but institutional clients are experiencing how volatile the cryptocurrency market is, especially through the Bitcoin ETF.9c:Teb6,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 Just five days ago, the market watched as one of crypto’s most famous whales, who once made $190 million shorting the Trump tariff crash, saw his fortune collapse to just $53. A massive $250 million liquidation on Hyperliquid wiped him out almost overnight. Many thought he was finished. But, no! In fact, new on-chain data revealed that the same trader might be back at press time, betting big again. The whale has already withdrawn 80,000 Ethereum [ETH] (Worth about $168 million) from Binance [BNB] , signaling strong confidence in Ethereum’s next move. This withdrawal, made on 05 February 2026, marks a major change in strategy. Instead of using extreme leverage like before, which led to his huge loss, the whale is now focusing on spot accumulation. Simply put, after losing everything, he’s re-entering the market. This time, with a long-term bet on Ethereum’s recovery. By removing $168 million worth of Ethereum from the market, the whale is shrinking the available supply. If others follow, this could create a supply squeeze and push the altcoin’s price higher. Traders don’t move 80,000 ETH to private wallets for short-term trades. This could be a sign that the whale believes the $2,000–$2,100 range may be a major market bottom. Signs of a possible reversal At the time of writing, ETH was valued at $2060.87 after a drop of 8.04% in the last 24 hours. On the technical front, while MACD pointed to weakness, the RSI had fallen into oversold territory. Such a finding is often evidence of a potential trend reversal. Source: TradingView Active addresses have also been declining, but that alone isn’t a reason to panic. Source: Glassnode In the current 2026 market, whale behavior, especially large withdrawals from exchanges, is a much stronger signal of future price movement than the number of active addresses. Right now, address data is distorted by post-upgrade spam and low-quality transactions, making it less reliable. Hence, Ethereum is caught in a tough battle between sellers and buyers now. Firms like Trend Research and Garrett Jin have been forced to sell large amounts of ETH, worth about $738 milli on, just to cover losses and repay loans. Additionally, OTC markets revealed that buyers picked up 33,000 ETH in a single day, and DBS-linked wallets added another 25,000 ETH this week. All these movements, along with technical indicators, may be indicative that the market may be preparing for a reversal. Final Thoughts Large private wallet transfers suggest that major players see the $2,000–$2,100 range as a potential long-term bottom. Whale movements are currently more reliable indicators of market sentiment than short-term network activity.

Santiment posted to X on Thursday that “whale and shark wallets” holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) have fallen to a nine-month low, collectively accounting for about 68.04% of the entire Bitcoin supply. “This includes a dump of -81,068 BTC in just the past 8 days alone,” Santiment said, as Bitcoin fell from around $90,000 to $65,000 over the same period, a roughly 27% decline, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin is trading at $64,792 at the time of publication, up from a 24-hour low of just over $60,000. Bitcoin large wallet holders appear to be offloading aggressively. Source: Santiment Crypto market participants often track large Bitcoin holders to spot signs of accumulation or offloading, as these moves can signal whether whales believe the asset has peaked or is poised for an uptrend. It isn’t just large Bitcoin holders that are showing signs of caution. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju posted to X on Wednesday that “every Bitcoin analyst is now bearish.” The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which measures overall crypto market sentiment, dropped to a score of 9 out of 100 on Friday, its lowest score since mid-2022, when the market was reeling from the collapse of the Terra blockchain. While there has been a sell-off among large holders, retail investors have been aggressively accumulating. Santiment said, “This combination of key stakeholders selling and retail buying is what historically creates bear cycles.” Related: Bitcoin slips under $64K as record-high selling intensifies: Where is the bottom? “Shrimp wallets,” which Santiment defines as those holding less than 0.1 Bitcoin, have risen to a 20-month high since June 2024, when Bitcoin was trading at around $66,000, before falling to $53,000 just two months later in August. However, by December 2024, it had reached $100,000 for the first time amid a booming market after Donald Trump won the US presidential election.

Analysts cite weak liquidity, negative sentiment, and cascading liquidations reinforcing bearish cycles. Rising capitulation and deleveraging may signal emerging long-term Bitcoin buying opportunities ahead. Trader losses intensified during the first week of February. Liquidation volume kept rising as the market repeatedly crushed recovery expectations, driven by consecutive red candles. However, several analyses point to light at the end of the tunnel, even though a rapid recovery remains unlikely. Sponsored Over $2.6 Billion Liquidated in 24 Hours Reflects Structural Market Weakness. CoinGlass reported that total crypto market liquidations reached $2.65 billion over the past 24 hours. Long positions accounted for more than $2.2 billion of that total. “According to CoinGlass data, in the past 24 hours, 586,053 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations reaching $2.65 billion,” CoinGlass reported.

This suggests the ranking could soon be reshuffled. The market analysis account, The Kobeissi Letter, explained that this move is not a short-term shock. It reflects a structural downturn that has been developing since October last year. What is happening in crypto? Since October 10th, crypto markets are now down -50%, erasing $2.2 TRILLION worth of market cap. Bitcoin has officially erased ALL of its post-election rally, now down -10% since Trump's election.

The account emphasized that this is a recurring cycle: liquidations damage sentiment, and worsening sentiment triggers further liquidations. Bitcoin’s intraday price swings of up to $10,000 were attributed to sharply reduced market depth. The current Bitcoin market depth is only 30% of its October peak.

Against this backdrop, veteran technical analyst Peter Brandt offered a forecast based on the “ Bitcoin Power Law ” model. He suggested that Bitcoin could trade within a “banana peel” range, with potential support near $42,000.

The largest crypto crashed to an intraday low near $60,000, marking its first visit to this level since October 2024 and fully erasing gains made after the US presidential election. The downside pressure quickly spread across the broader crypto market . Ethereum slipped below $1,800, while Solana broke under $70 for the first time since December 2023. Dogecoin also plunged below the $0.10 mark, intensifying risk-off sentiment and triggering panic across retail-heavy tokens. With key supports breached across major assets, traders are now questioning whether Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have officially transitioned from a correction into a full-fledged bear market. Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Dropped to $60,000 Since Bitcoin slipped below the psychological $100,000 level, market sentiment has shifted sharply. Both traders and institutions appear increasingly cautious, with confidence fading faster than in previous pullbacks. Unlike past market crashes, triggered by systemic shocks such as the ICO bubble, COVID-led liquidity stress, the Terra ecosystem collapse, or the FTX failure, the current decline lacks a single catastrophic event. Instead, the sell-off reflects a technical breakdown in market structure, compounded by weakening conviction and reduced risk appetite among participants. Massive Long Liquidations Took Control Over the past few days, the crypto market has been under intense pressure, with liquidation numbers repeatedly crossing $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The latest sell-off was especially brutal, wiping out over $1.85 billion in long positions, making it the second-largest liquidation event of 2026, after the $2.4 billion flush seen on January 31. The impact was widespread and painful. More than 500,000 traders were forced out of their positions as leverage unravelled across exchanges. The largest single liquidation—a Bitcoin long worth more than $12 million—was recorded on Binance, highlighting just how exposed even large players were to the downside move. Bitcoin Price Dropped Below Key Technical Support Bitcoin’s fall to $60,000 was driven by a clear technical breakdown rather than a headline-driven shock. The sell-off accelerated after BTC decisively lost the $65,000–$62,000 support zone, an area that had held multiple pullbacks over the past few weeks. Once Bitcoin slipped below $62,000, stop-loss orders clustered in this range were triggered rapidly. This led to a sharp increase in sell pressure and opened the way to the next major liquidity pocket near $60,000, where the price briefly stabilised. The breakdown was further confirmed as Bitcoin dropped below key trend indicators. BTC lost support at both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, levels closely watched by swing traders and short-term institutions. The failure to reclaim these averages turned them into immediate resistance, strengthening the bearish bias. Weak Dip Buying at Key Levels—Why Buyers Stepped Back One thing that stood out during Bitcoin’s slide to $60,000 was how quietly buyers stepped back. When the price fell through the $65,000–$62,000 zone, there was no strong rush to buy the dip, unlike earlier pullbacks. Any short-term bounce was quickly sold, showing that traders were more focused on cutting risk than building new positions. With volatility high and liquidations piling up, many chose to stay on the sidelines and wait for clarity. That lack of conviction left Bitcoin exposed, allowing sellers to stay in control and push the price down toward the $60,000 level. The Bottom Line—Has the Crypto Market Officially Entered a Bear Market? The recent sell-off has clearly changed the mood across the crypto market. Bitcoin losing the $60,000 level, repeated billion-dollar liquidation events, broken supports, and a lack of strong dip buying suggest this move is more serious than a normal correction. Confidence has weakened, risk appetite has dropped, and traders are no longer quick to step in on dips. Still, calling this an official bear market may be too early. Bear markets usually show prolonged weakness and repeated failures to recover key levels, not just a sharp breakdown. Right now, the market feels stuck in between—no longer bullish, but not fully broken either. What happens next matters most. If Bitcoin fails to reclaim lost levels and selling pressure continues, this phase could easily turn into a full-fledged bear market. For now, crypto stands at a decisive crossroads.

Updated Feb 6, 2026, 7:32 a.m. Published Feb 6, 2026, 5:36 a.m. Talk about frenzied trading. On Thursday, BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, tickered as IBIT, hit a wild record with over 284 million shares traded, per Nasdaq data . That’s a whopping $10 billion-plus in notional value. STORY CONTINUES BELOW To put it in perspective, that smashed the old record of 169.21 million shares from Nov. 21 by a massive 169%. The record volume came as IBIT plunged 13% to under $35, the lowest since Oct. 11, 2024, extending the year-to-date loss to 27%. Prices peaked at a high of $71.82 in early October. The fund processed redemptions totaling $175.33 million on Thursday, accounting for 40% of the cumulative net outflow of $434.11 million across 11 funds, according to SoSoValue. IBIT, the world's largest publicly listed bitcoin fund, holds physical coins and is designed to mirror the spot price of the world's top cryptocurrency, which has been declining recently, crashing to nearly $60,000 on Thursday. The fund has been a preferred alternative investment vehicle for institutions seeking exposure to cryptocurrency through regulated products. Capitulation hints The combination of record volume and price crash often signals capitulation – long-term holders throwing in the towel and liquidating their holdings at a loss. It marks the bear market's peak selling phase, potentially signaling the start of a slow, painful bottoming process. IBIT options trading on Thursday told the same story. Longer duration put options. or contracts used to hedge against downturns, reached a record premium of over 25 volatility points above call options (bullish bets), according to data from MarketChameleon. That kind of heavy put bias often signals peak fear as well. That said, nothing's guaranteed, as bear markets can drag on longer than even dip buyers can stay liquid.a1:T1320,$2.6 billion in BTC and ETH options expire amid elevated volatility and defensive positioning. Bitcoin trades far below max pain as institutions ramp up downside hedging. Options expiry could reset dealer flows and trigger sharp post-settlement moves. More than $2.6 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options are set to expire, a development that could reshape short-term price dynamics as traders unwind hedges and reposition. The event comes amid elevated volatility, defensive positioning, and growing evidence that institutional participants are actively hedging downside risk. Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Expiry Could Trigger Volatility as $2.6 Billion in Contracts Settle Data from derivatives markets shows Bitcoin accounts for the bulk of the expiry, with roughly $2.2 billion in notional value tied to contracts. Ethereum represents an additional $419 million, bringing the combined total to more than $2.6 billion. Bitcoin is currently trading near $64,686 , significantly below its max pain level of $80,000, the price at which the greatest number of options would expire worthless. Total open interest stands at 33,984 contracts, including 21,396 calls and 12,588 puts, resulting in a put-to-call ratio of 0.59. Bitcoin Expiring Options.

Total open interest stands at 219,034 contracts, with call open interest of 113,427 and put open interest of 105,607. The put-to-call ratio of 0.93 suggests a more balanced, yet still cautious, positioning compared with Bitcoin. Ethereum Expiring Options. Source: Deribit Sponsored Sponsored The gap between spot prices and max pain levels suggests that option sellers could benefit if prices remain suppressed into expiry. Meanwhile, traders holding directional bets may face losses if markets remain range-bound. Notably, today’s expiring options are significantly lower than the $8.8 billion contracts that settled last Friday , because the January 30 event was for the month. Institutions Hedge as Volatility Climbs Nevertheless, analysts at Greeks.live say derivatives markets are showing clear signs of stress and repositioning, with volatility rising sharply and traders moving to protect portfolios. “The $60,000 range [for Bitcoin] represents the consolidation zone prior to the Trump rally, where support remains relatively strong. Should a rapid dip occur in the short term, it may present a buying opportunity,” they wrote . Sponsored Sponsored According to the analysts, options data indicate institutions and large players are urgently hedging and placing bets. Bitcoin’s current-month implied volatility (IV) has surged to 100%, doubling since the start of the year, while the main contracts’ IV has also breached 50%, climbing 15% over two weeks. With skew at a two-year low, the experts say options market structure is now entirely dominated by bearish sentiment, though some lottery-style buying of deeply out-of-the-money options has emerged. “The market currently exhibits excessive panic, and conditions for a sustained BTC crash remain insufficient. Rapid risk-off liquidation could actually facilitate a market rebound,” Greeks.live analysts wrote. Indeed, the market is in panic mode, and with good reason, as the Bitcoin price steadily edges toward the $60,000 psychological level . Sponsored Sponsored The surge in implied volatility to 100% highlights the scale of uncertainty currently priced into Bitcoin markets, reflecting expectations of larger-than-normal price swings. Expiry Could Reset Market Flows Elsewhere, Deribit analysts note that options positioning is clustered around key strike levels, which may be influencing price behavior ahead of expiry. “With protection demand already increasing and volatility repriced, this expiry could act as a short-term reset in dealer hedging flows. Expiry may remove positioning-related ‘gravity’ around big strikes, so price behavior after 08:00 UTC may differ from the days leading into expiry,” Deribit analysts stated . The options expire at 08:00 UTC on Deribit. If those dynamics play out, markets could see increased volatility immediately after expiry as hedging flows unwind and liquidity conditions shift. While bearish sentiment currently dominates derivatives positioning, panic-driven markets can sometimes produce sharp rebounds, particularly if large liquidations clear excess leverage.

The move comes as Bitcoin trades around $64,800 after a sharp drop, adding to fears that miners may be increasing sell-offs. Marathon Digital Bitcoin Transfer Signals Possible Selling On February 6, Marathon Digital Holdings moved a total of 1,318 BTC valued near $87 million to institutional platforms, including Two Prime, BitGo, and Galaxy Digital. These are well-known institutional platforms that provide custody, trading, and liquidity services. When a mining company sends coins to such firms, it often signals preparation for structured selling, collateral use, or treasury rebalancing. However, the transfers happened within roughly a 10-hour window while Bitcoin traded around the mid-$60,000 range after a sharp daily drop. Marathon Current Bitcoin Holdings Despite the transfer, Marathon still holds about 52,850 BTC worth around 3.42 billion, keeping it among the top corporate Bitcoin holders worldwide. This shows the company is adjusting part of its treasury, not exiting its position. Still, the timing adds to short-term caution. Bitcoin is already down nearly 10% in 24 hours, and broader sentiment is fragile . When miner flows rise during a falling market, traders tend to expect more volatility. Miner & Whale Continue to Sell Bitcoin One major pressure is coming from Bitcoin miners. The average mining cost has risen above $87,000, while Bitcoin trades near $65,402, forcing many miners to sell at a loss. CryptoQuant data shows miner reserves have dropped to 1.806 million BTC, confirming rising sell-offs. Meanwhile, selling is not limited to miners. Santiment data reveals that Bitcoin whales and large holders are also reducing positions. Wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC now control just 68.04% of total supply, a nine-month low. These large holders have sold about 81,068 BTC in the last eight days alone. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Garlinghouse took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a piece of investment advice from Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. "My favorite Warren Buffett quote," Garlinghouse wrote late Thursday night as the sell-off accelerated. "'Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful!'" HOT Stories My favorite Warren Buffet quote: "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful!" — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) February 5, 2026 Buffett famously coined the phrase in his 1986 Letter to Shareholders (published in early 1987). His readiness to be "greedy" allowed him to scoop up discounted assets. Ripple leadership seemingly views the current downturn as a buying opportunity created by market hysteria. Leading the crash Garlinghouse’s optimism comes at a time of extreme distress for XRP holders. As reported by U.Today , the token has emerged as the single worst performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies during this correction.

Extremely extreme fear On Friday, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which is the industry's main gauge of market emotion, collapsed to a reading of 9.

The investment arm of stablecoin issuer Tether has acquired a $150 million stake in the precious metals platform Gold.com to expand access to tokenized gold. Tether said on Thursday that it acquired an approximately 12% stake in the company, which will integrate Tether Gold (XAUt), its gold-backed cryptocurrency, into Gold.com’s platform. Source: Tether Gold.com is a publicly listed online marketplace that sells gold and other precious metals, such as silver and platinum, to several markets, including the US. “Gold has played a central role in preserving value for centuries, particularly during periods of monetary stress and geopolitical uncertainty,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. “Gold exposure is not a trade for Tether; it is a hedge and a long-term allocation to protect our user base and ourselves in a world that is becoming increasingly unstable.” He added the company’s investment in Gold.com “reflects a long-term belief that gold should be as accessible, transferable, and usable as modern digital money, without compromising on physical backing or ownership.” Tether explores stablecoin payments for gold Tether and Gold.com are also exploring options to enable customers to purchase physical gold with Tether’s flagship stablecoin USDt ( USDT ) and its new stablecoin specifically for the US market, USAt (USAT), which it launched with crypto-native bank Anchorage Digital on Jan. 27.

Analysts and AI forecasts alike suggest that XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term XRP price predictions also place it as high as $26.50 by 2030, with an ultra-bullish target of $526 by 2050. Ripple (XRP) remains one of the top five crypto assets in the world, gaining traction as institutional adoption ramps up and its prolonged legal battle approaches resolution. Since President Trump’s return to office, XRP has seen a resurgence in on-chain activity, investor sentiment, and even XRP ETF approved turned it into a bluechip asset. Now, making this the most ideal time for XRP price prediction 2026-2030 to be in more focus. Read this to know in depth what’s coming next in XRP. XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $1.3600 -0.37% Market Cap $ 82,847,710,724.00 24h Volume $ 13,657,990,283.4652 Circulating Supply 60,917,315,351.00 Total Supply 99,985,721,048.00 All-Time High $ 3.8419 on 04 January 2018 All-Time Low $ 0.0028 on 07 July 2014 Coinpedia’s XRP Price Prediction XRP is currently falling towards $1.05 after breaking $1.41 due to negative macro pressures. The $1.05 level is a key support area; a rebound could see XRP rise to $2.0 or its all-time high of $3.66 in Q1 2026, but a drop below $1.05 could lead to further declines. XRP Price Prediction For February 2026 A long-term declining channel broke in early February, and that even breached $1.41. Now, the nearest support is near $1.05, where a consolidation can be expected to rebuild demand. The two key resistances are now $1.63 and $1.41; they need to be flipped in February, or else $1.05 could breach too if it doesn’t recover. On the weekly chart, XRP’s price shows significant weakness and is slipping towards $1.05 after breaking $1.41 support in early February. But this selling pressure is due to worsening macro factors, which are pushing crypto markets deeper, and XRP is affected by it in early February. However, $1.05 is a FRVP tool-based high-intensity support area that has a history of supporting rallies and could act as a reversal point in the remaining days of Q1 2026. If a reversal comes, the XRP price might recover to $2.0 in Q1 2026 or even reach its ATH of $3.66. But $1.05 is crucial to sustaining price action; otherwise, the drop could extend further. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2026 $1.75 $3.45 $5.05 XRP Onchain Outlook The XRP Ledger: DEX Transaction Count chart indicates a significant bullish divergence starting from May 2025. While the price is consolidating, the activity in decentralised exchanges (DEX) is increasing sharply. The high transaction volume, which includes both orders placed and cancelled, shows that experienced traders are actively positioning themselves and adding liquidity in anticipation of a future price movement. As a result, this on-chain metric suggests that the market is preparing for a powerful and sustainable rally in the XRP price ahead. Also, the biggest fact right now in December is that altcoin liquidity is drying up. Projects securing new liquidity channels like ETFs have a better chance of long-term survival, and since November 14th, the XRP ETF has been seeing positive inflows consistently, despite what price action is, and so far, Cumulative Total Net Inflow has crossed $756 million, while total net assets are worth $723.05 million, by December 1st.

Price predictions for 2026 range from $400 to $600. Long term outlook suggests gradual growth potential to approach $1200 by 2030. Aave (AAVE) is a decentralized finance protocol built on Ethereum that facilitates permissionless lending and borrowing through smart contracts. After witnessing a strong expansion in the previous market cycle, AAVE entered a prolonged correction phase, with price gradually retracing from its earlier highs. Throughout 2025, AAVE remained in a consolidation structure, reflecting a period of market digestion rather than trend continuation. While short-term momentum has cooled, the broader technical structure suggests that AAVE may be transitioning into a new accumulation phase. As volatility contracts and price holds above long-term demand levels, attention is now shifting toward whether 2026 can trigger the next major price discovery cycle. Cryptocurrency Avalanche Token AVAX Price $8.6009 -9.66% Market Cap $ 3,713,623,564.44 24h Volume $ 987,651,801.7558 Circulating Supply 431,771,961.1772 Total Supply 463,441,061.1772 All-Time High $ 146.2179 on 21 November 2021 All-Time Low $ 2.7888 on 31 December 2020 CoinPedia’s Avalanche Price Prediction AVAX dropped to $9 after facing resistance at $15 in January. A recovery is possible, with high expectations for Q1 2026. Based on recovery odds, experts are targeting $20 with even potential to reach $28, and if it breaks that, $44 by mid-year. If $28 holds, consolidation may continue. Avalanche (Avax) Price Prediction 2026 In January, the AVAX price faced rejection from $15 and slipped to $9 support zone in early February. Since Q1 still has many days left, a recovery remains an option, as it has reached a demand area of $9 that ignited the late 2024 rally. Sustained demand here could signal a reversal. Now, expectations for its recovery, which are gaining momentum in Q1 2026, are significantly higher. Now, it appears AVAX may not have performed in 2025 to the present time, but it was all about establishing a base, and it seems it has done so. Now, an impressive rally ahead is a strong possibility. For Q1, we expect $20 with potential to test the pattern’s upper border at $28. However, if it clears the upper border, we can expect AVAX to hit $44 by the end of the first half. But if $28 repels, then the first half could see consolidation stretching. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 (conservative) $25 $33 $50 AVAX On-Chain Analysis AVAX shows a highly bullish sentiment. Big Whale Orders in both spot and futures indicate strong institutional accumulation. With Taker Buy Dominance at 90 days, aggressive buyers are in control, while the Cooling volume bubble map suggests a healthy consolidation phase.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Congress that traditional and crypto banking products and services may be more intertwined in the future. Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, Bessent was asked by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis whether there could come a time when conventional banks and crypto are offering the same types of products. “I think that can happen over time,” Bessent said. “We’ve actually been working with small and community banks to discuss how they can be part of the digital asset revolution.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifying before Senate Banking on Thursday.

Read our Editorial Policy https://cointelegraph.com/editorial-policya8:T40c,TRON has officially overtaken Ethereum in USDT dominance, capturing 44.97% versus Ethereum's 44.56%. This shift is significant as stablecoin dominance is considered a foundational element for DeFi dominance, providing deeper liquidity for trading, lending, and borrowing. Over the past month, TRON's USDT supply increased by 3.62% to 83.49 billion, while Ethereum saw a 5.6% decrease to 82.74 billion, despite Ethereum still maintaining a much higher Total Value Locked (TVL) of $58 billion compared to TRON's $4 billion.

The article highlights how TRON is positioning itself as a potentially more resilient DeFi hub during market volatility. With 48% of TRX tokens locked (versus Ethereum's 30%), TRON demonstrates stronger staking activity that may help reduce selling pressure. The combination of high staking rates and growing USDT liquidity is creating a 'flywheel effect' that could make TRON more attractive to users seeking stability in volatile markets, suggesting we're witnessing a 'stablecoin war' between Layer 1 networks.a9:Ta0f,TRON ได้แซงหน้า Ethereum ในส่วนแบ่งการครอบงำ USDT อย่างเป็นทางการ โดยครอบงำ 44.97% เมื่อเทียบกับ Ethereum ที่ 44.56% การเปลี่ยนแปลงนี้มีความสำคัญ เนื่องจากการครอบงำของ stablecoin ถือเป็นฐานสำคัญสำหรับการครอบงำ DeFi ซึ่งช่วยให้มีความสามารถในการซื้อขายที่ดีขึ้น การกู้ยืม และการให้กู้ยืม ในช่วงเดือนที่ผ่านมา อุปทาน USDT ของ TRON เพิ่มขึ้น 3.62% เป็น 83.49 พันล้าน ในขณะที่ Ethereum มีการลดลง 5.6% เป็น 82.74 พันล้าน แม้ว่า Ethereum จะยังคงมีมูลค่า Total Value Locked (TVL) สูงถึง 58 พันล้านดอลลาร์ เมื่อเทียบกับ TRON ที่ 4 พันล้านดอลลาร์

The logic is simple – Networks with more stablecoins locked on-chain have deeper liquidity, which enables smoother trading, lending, and borrowing. Notably, with Tether [USDT] alone accounting for 60% of the stablecoin market, it gives the networks that host it a relatively stronger foundation. Looking at L1s, it’s clear that they are strategizing around this advantage. According to DeFiLlama, TRON [TRX] has officially overtaken Ethereum [ETH] in USDT dominance, capturing 44.97% versus ETH’s 44.56%. This has reinforced the idea that stablecoins are becoming a critical battleground. Source: DeFiLlama Zooming out, TRON’s growing USDT share is even more obvious. Over the past month, TRX’s USDT supply jumped by 3.62%, hitting 83.49 billion. All while Ethereum saw a 5.6% drop over the same period, falling to 82.74 billion. What makes this interesting is the timing. TRON’s USDT growth is happening in a risk-off market , where major assets are correcting. Ethereum, for example, slid by 15.36% over the month to multi-month lows. By comparison, TRX has limited its losses to 2.6%, raising the question – Is TRON positioning itself as a more resilient DeFi hub, one that can weather volatility better than ETH thanks to its growing stablecoin base? TRON emerges as a DeFi rail amid the stablecoin race Liquidity is what really drives DeFi dominance. Analysts are calling it a ‘stablecoin war’ between L1s . TRON is making moves, grabbing more USDT dominance, but Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) of $58 billion still dwarfs TRON’s $4 billion. In other words, Ethereum remains the go-to hub for overall “liquidity.” That said, locked TRX just hit a record 46.2 billion, or 48% of the total supply – A sign that TRON is quietly building a strong and resilient DeFi base. Source: CryptoQuant By comparison, Ethereum’s locked supply sits at just around 30%. From a technical perspective, TRON’s higher staking rate cuts down circulating supply pressure, helping it hold up better in volatile markets. At the same time, more stablecoins are flowing through its ecosystem. Together, high staking and USDT liquidity create a flywheel – Staked tokens cap volatility, while stablecoin dominance pulls in more users. As a result, TRON is quietly becoming the DeFi rail, running through Justin Sun now. Final Thoughts TRON captured 44.97% of USDT vs. Ethereum’s 44.56%, highlighting the growing importance of stablecoins in DeFi. With 48% of TRX locked and rising USDT flows, TRON is building a DeFi flywheel that reduces volatility and attracts users.

Cynthia Lummis has urged banks to “embrace” stablecoins, calling them a faster, cheaper payment rail and “an entirely new financial product” for customers. CLARITY Act talks have stalled after the Senate markup was pulled, with banks pushing limits on stablecoin rewards and warning of deposit volatility. Treasury Secretary Bessent pressed for the bill to pass, while analysts say delays raise uncertainty as stablecoins gain “strategic significance.” Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has urged traditional banks on Thursday to embrace stablecoins and view digital assets as a business opportunity, pushing back against banking industry opposition that has stalled crypto's flagship market structure bill. "I'd like to see the banks embrace this rather than resist it," Lummis said during an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, noting that stablecoins would give banks "an entirely new financial product that they can offer to their customers." The pushback comes as negotiations over the market structure bill remain deadlocked , with banks and credit unions warning senators that stablecoin rewards could trigger deposit flight from traditional accounts, particularly at community banks that rely on stable deposits for local lending. Digital asset analyst Nic Puckrin, co-founder of Coin Bureau, told Decrypt the ongoing delays represent "a real anticlimax" that will keep "a cap on digital asset prices before any geopolitical turbulence is factored in." He said stablecoins have “strategic significance” amid dollar weakness, calling them a “backdoor to strengthen the dollar” even during geopolitical and macro stress. "Whichever way the chips fall, though, it's clear stablecoins will remain a competitor to bank deposits,” Puckrin added, “Short of an outright ban on any form of rewards, there's little that can stop this." Lummis, the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, framed stablecoins as fundamentally pro-consumer technology that would make financial services "faster and cheaper" for both domestic and international transactions. "Money can be transmitted on the blockchain more quickly than it can if you're going through existing bank structures," Lummis told Bartiromo, while pointing out that safety mechanisms developed with the Federal Reserve would protect users. The scheduled markup cancellation of the market structure bill came just hours after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong abruptly withdrew support for the legislation, citing disagreements over its stablecoin yield provisions and warning the draft would be worse than the status quo. Lummis told Bartiromo that the bank resistance targets the GENIUS Act , not the market structure bill, saying lenders want to revisit stablecoin rules to prevent products that look like “interest” or a “bank-type product.” She added that lawmakers attempted to resolve the issue "by calling them bonuses or rewards, but we don't seem to be at a place where we can move this bill forward yet in committee." The congresswoman pushed back on banks’ concerns, saying that stablecoins represent new revenue streams for banks through custody services, already permitted in three states, with faster payment mechanisms that compete with debit cards. During testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stressed to lawmakers that the CLARITY Act must pass, adding that participants who oppose it “should move to El Salvador.” The Wyoming Senator mentioned to Bartiromo that despite losing their initial window, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has assured that floor time will be reserved for the legislation later this spring.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has fallen 12% over the past 24 hours to briefly touch a low of $60,000 early on Friday. Meanwhile, the crypto market capitalization fell by almost 9%, according to CoinMarketCap. CleanSpark (CLSK) led the decline, closing trading on Thursday down 19.13% and falling another 8.6% after-hours to $7.55 after its results for the quarter ended Dec. 31 came in below analyst predictions. CleanSpark’s stock price fell 19.13% over the trading day on Thursday. Source: Google Finance CleanSpark said on Thursday that its revenues for the quarter ended Dec. 31 came in at $181.20 million, missing analyst estimates of $186.66 million by around 2.9%. CleanSpark misses earnings, but eyes AI as profit booster Analysts at Zacks said that the reduced mining rewards following the Bitcoin halving in April 2024 likely led to “lower mining efficiency” and therefore potentially “constrained profit” during the period. CleanSpark reported a net loss of $378.7 million, a sharp year-on-year decline compared to the net profit of $246.8 million it reported for the same period in 2024. CleanSpark’s chief financial officer and president, Gary Vecchiarelli, said that the company is “no longer a single-track business,” as it looks to artificial intelligence to boost profits. “Bitcoin mining generates the cash flow, AI infrastructure monetizes the assets over the long term, and our Digital Asset Management function optimizes capital and liquidity across cycles,” Vecchiarelli said. IREN shares fall on earnings miss IREN Ltd, which has moved its core operations from Bitcoin to providing AI infrastructure, also missed earnings on Thursday, with its shares closing the day down 11.46% and falling an additional 18.5% after hours to $32.42. IREN reported revenues of $184.69 million for the last quarter of 2025, missing Wall Street’s expectations by 16.49%. It posted a net loss of $155.4 million, compared to a net income of $384.6 million in the year-ago quarter.

Feb 6, 2026, 4:43 a.m. Bitcoin miner MARA moved 1,318 BTC worth about $86.89 million to a mix of counterparties and custody venues over the past 10 hours, onchain data tracked by Arkham shows. The biggest slice went to Two Prime. One transfer sent 653.773 BTC, around $42.01 million, to a Two Prime tagged address, alongside a smaller 8.999 BTC top up worth about $578,000 just minutes later. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Separate outbound transactions sent 200 BTC and 99.999 BTC to a BitGo tagged address, together about $20.4 million at the time of transfer, while another 305 BTC moved to a fresh address, worth roughly $20.72 million. (Arkham) The flow matters mainly because of timing. Crypto markets have been swinging hard since this week’s liquidation driven selloff, and traders are on edge for any sign that miners are turning into forced sellers. Large miner related transfers can be routine treasury management, custody reshuffling, collateral moves, or preparation for an over the counter sale, but in a thin market they often get read as a supply signal. The Two Prime leg will draw the most attention because it is a credit and trading counterparty. If the bitcoin is being posted as collateral or rotated into a strategy, it does not necessarily imply spot selling. The transfers comes amid a tough period for miners, with bitcoin down nearly 50% from peak prices above $126,000 last year. Bitcoin is now approximately 20% below its estimated average production cost, as CoinDesk reported Thursday, increasing financial pressure across the BTC mining sector. The average cost to mine one bitcoin is around $87,000, according to data from Checkonchain , while the spot price has fallen toward a weekly low of $60,000 Historically, trading below production cost has been a feature of a bear market.ae:T16d8,Bitcoin has once again tested investor conviction. After revisiting levels last seen during the 2025 drawdown, price action has reinforced a familiar reality of the asset class: volatility remains a defining feature, even as the market continues to mature. For long-term holders, these cycles are nothing new. Bitcoin has weathered repeated corrections over the past decade, often emerging stronger in subsequent phases. But for a growing segment of the market, particularly investors with longer planning horizons, the latest move has prompted a broader reassessment of how returns are generated in crypto. The question increasingly being asked is not whether Bitcoin will recover, but whether relying solely on price appreciation remains the most effective way to deploy capital in digital assets. Volatility Is Normal, Expectations Are Changing Bitcoin’s price history has always been cyclical. Sharp drawdowns have historically coincided with periods of consolidation, shifts in liquidity conditions, or broader macro uncertainty. What has changed over time is the composition of participants. As crypto ownership has expanded beyond early adopters and traders, more capital is entering the market with different expectations. Portfolio managers, family offices, and long-term allocators tend to evaluate exposure through a wider lens, balancing risk, time horizons, and income needs. For these investors, volatility is not necessarily a reason to exit the market. It is, however, a reason to reconsider how exposure is structured. From Price Exposure to Return Structure For much of crypto’s history, returns have been dominated by price movements. Income strategies, where they existed, were often variable by design. Staking rewards fluctuated. Lending rates adjusted with demand. Incentive programs changed as protocols evolved. While these approaches remain relevant for active participants, they offer limited predictability. Returns can vary significantly over time, and planning around future cash flows is difficult. This has led some investors to explore alternatives that place more emphasis on structure than on market timing. Rather than attempting to optimise entry and exit points, the focus shifts toward defined terms, known durations, and clearer expectations around income. Why This Shift Is Gaining Attention Now Several factors are converging to make this reassessment more visible. First, crypto markets have matured operationally. Custody, settlement, and reporting infrastructure has improved, making more structured approaches feasible. Second, the experience of recent market cycles has highlighted the trade-offs between flexibility and predictability. Variable returns can be attractive in rising markets, but they also introduce uncertainty during prolonged periods of consolidation. Finally, as digital assets increasingly sit alongside traditional investments, they are being evaluated using familiar financial frameworks. Concepts such as duration, income visibility, and risk-adjusted returns are becoming part of the conversation. Fixed Income Enters the Discussion In traditional finance, fixed-income instruments exist to provide clarity. Capital is committed for a defined period. Returns are agreed upfront. Payments follow a schedule. The trade-off is well understood: upside is capped in exchange for predictability. In crypto, applying these principles is still relatively new, but interest is growing. Some platforms are beginning to structure exposure through fixed-term instruments that aim to deliver defined returns independent of short-term price movements. Rather than replacing direct asset exposure, these approaches are being viewed as complementary. They offer an alternative for capital that prioritises planning over speculation. how fixed income works in crypto A Broader Reassessment of Crypto Returns Bitcoin’s recent price action has not undermined its long-term narrative. If anything, it has reinforced its role as a volatile, high-conviction asset. What it has done, however, is accelerate a conversation that was already underway. As the market evolves, investors are increasingly distinguishing between exposure and outcome. Holding Bitcoin remains a strategic decision. How returns are generated on deployed capital is becoming a separate one. Platforms such as Varntix have emerged as part of this broader shift by exploring fixed-income structures within a digital asset context. Their relevance lies less in any single product and more in what they represent: a move toward clearer expectations and more deliberate capital allocation. The Bigger Picture Bitcoin will continue to be central to crypto markets, and volatility will remain part of the landscape. But as participation broadens, so too will the range of strategies investors use to engage with digital assets. For some, price exposure will remain the primary focus. For others, particularly those navigating longer time horizons, the appeal of structured returns is becoming harder to ignore. The current market environment is not signalling an exit from crypto. It is signalling a diversification of how returns are pursued within it.

Strategy plans to launch a Bitcoin security program aimed at addressing threats posed by quantum computing and other future security vulnerabilities, said Executive Chairman Michael Saylor during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. According to Saylor, the program will work with “the global cybersecurity community, the global crypto security community, and the global Bitcoin security committee” to help coordinate research and responses to those emerging risks. “We think it’s reasonable and appropriate for us to do this, given our large responsibility as a Bitcoin holder. But we want to do it in a very responsible fashion. And we want to make sure that we coordinate with the global cyber crypto and Bitcoin security community, because there are a lot of very, very brilliant minds here,” Saylor said . “There’s a lot of good work being done. And it’s likely that consensus will form and solutions will form at the right time in a responsible fashion.” Vulnerabilities in Bitcoin’s elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), are susceptible to compromise by Shor’s Algorithm as quantum computing advances. Research estimates suggest approximately 25% of the Bitcoin supply is currently vulnerable; these ‘at-risk’ holdings primarily consist of early P2PK addresses and reused addresses where the public key has already been revealed on the blockchain. Addressing concerns about quantum computing, Saylor dismissed them as the latest in a long history of “FUD” that Bitcoin has repeatedly overcome. He argued that while such risks should be taken seriously, investors should not panic or rush into premature technical changes that could create new vulnerabilities. “We think it’s probably 10 or more years away before there’s a threat. That is the consensus. It’s a promising technology, but it’s still nascent,” Saylor said, adding that many global communities are working on quantum-resistant protocols. “If Bitcoin requires an upgrade, there will be global consensus. Right now, there isn’t global consensus that existing cryptographic libraries are at risk,” he noted. “You have to be very thoughtful about addressing these risks. And you have to address them at the right time, not too soon, not too late. Because too soon, you probably don’t have the right technology, and you’re over-insuring too late. You accept risks that you shouldn’t.” “Bitcoin will be stronger if and when that quantum upgrade takes place. And so Bitcoin is upgradeable. And Bitcoin can be upgraded to be stronger,” he emphasized. Some analysts warn that quantum-capable computers could emerge between 2027 and 2030, and the crypto ecosystem has begun responding to these concerns, including developer proposals such as BIP 360 designed to implement quantum-resistant features in Bitcoin. The perceived risks have prompted some investors to take defensive positions. Jefferies analyst Christopher Wood removed Bitcoin from his portfolio, citing quantum threats.b0:Te1e,Vitalik Buterin warns copy-paste Layer 2s and generic EVM chains are stalling Ethereum’s long-term scaling vision. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said that many new Layer 2 (L2) networks are repeating shallow design patterns, and warned that generic EVM chains with optimistic bridges are holding back meaningful progress. His comments extend the public debate over whether today’s L2 ecosystem still aligns with Ethereum’s original scaling goals. No More “Copypasta” EVM Chains In a February 5 post on X, Buterin argued that comfort and familiarity, not technical necessity, are driving many L2 launches, leading to copy-paste designs that add little beyond surface-level Ethereum compatibility. The developer drew a comparison between infrastructure choices and governance habits, writing that making yet another EVM chain and adding “an optimistic bridge to Ethereum with a one-week delay” has become routine in the same way forking Compound once dominated DAO governance. “That’s something we’ve done far too much for far too long, because we got comfortable, and which has sapped our imagination and put us in a dead end,” Buterin wrote. He was even more direct about alternative designs that drop Ethereum bridges entirely. “If you make an EVM chain without an optimistic bridge to Ethereum, that’s even worse,” he said, adding, “We don’t friggin need more copypasta EVM chains, and we definitely don’t need even more L1s.” Buterin insisted that Ethereum’s base layer is already scaling and will continue to add EVM block space through 2026, though not without limits. He noted that some workloads, such as AI-related applications, may still require lower latency or specialized execution environments. In his view, those needs should push developers toward genuinely new architectures rather than lightly modified replicas. Matching “Vibes” With Real Ethereum Connection Buterin’s criticism builds on comments he made earlier, suggesting many L2s no longer meet the original definition of scaling Ethereum because they fail to fully inherit its security.

In his latest post, the 32-year-old stressed that public positioning should reflect technical reality. “Vibes need to match substance,” he wrote, criticizing projects that market themselves as tightly connected to Ethereum while treating that link as an afterthought. The blockchain’s co-founder outlined two models he considers reasonable. One is an app chain that depends deeply on Ethereum, such as prediction markets that settle and manage accounts on the L1 while handling execution on a rollup. The other is what he called “institutional L2s,” where systems like government registries publish cryptographic proofs on-chain for transparency, even if they are not trustless or credibly neutral. “If you’re the first thing, it’s valid and great to call yourself an Ethereum application,” Buterin said. “If you’re the second thing, then you’re not Ethereum… so you should just say those things directly.” SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer). Tags:b1:T7f2,A sharp rise in volatility, a spike in defensive positioning and an increase in fear-driven search interest typically push the index lower. Feb 6, 2026, 4:31 a.m. Crypto market sentiment sank to its bleakest level since the FTX collapse after bitcoin’s sharp drop this week dragged prices across the board and forced a wave of deleveraging. The widely followed Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 9 on Friday, a reading categorized as “extreme fear” and one that has historically only appeared during major breakdowns in market confidence. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The index stood at 12 a day earlier, 16 last week and 42 last month, suggestive of how quickly traders have shifted from cautious to outright defensive. The fear gauge is built primarily around bitcoin, combining several indicators that attempt to quantify investor mood rather than price direction. It includes volatility and drawdowns, market momentum and trading volume, social media engagement, bitcoin dominance and Google Trends data tied to bitcoin-related searches. A sharp rise in volatility, a spike in defensive positioning and an increase in fear-driven search interest typically push the index lower. The collapse in sentiment comes as bitcoin briefly traded near $60,000 in late U.S. hours Thursday before bouncing back toward $65,000, a whipsaw move that reflected both forced liquidations and opportunistic dip-buying. While the rebound suggests some buyers are willing to step in near major psychological levels, the sentiment reading implies the broader market remains in “sell first, ask questions later” mode. In past cycles, extreme fear has often coincided with local bottoms, largely because panic conditions tend to flush out leveraged traders and short-term holders. But that is not a rule, and the index is better read as a snapshot of stress rather than a timing tool. The index does not predict where bitcoin goes next, however. But it does show that the market has returned to the kind of fear typically reserved for systemic events.b2:T1211,Crypto market loses $266 billion as liquidations push total capitalization near support. Bitcoin hits 28 month low near $64,536 with downside risk toward $55,883. STABLE plunges 23.4 percent as selling pressure tests key support levels. The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin (BTC) registered their largest single-day falls this year, bringing the latter to $64,500. Stable (STABLE) followed the crypto king, falling by 23% in 24 hours, pulling away from its all-time high. In the news today:- Sponsored Sponsored MicroStrategy shares came under renewed pressure after Bitcoin fell to $60,000, pushing the company’s large BTC holdings further below its average purchase price. With Bitcoin about 21% under cost basis, MicroStrategy’s stock now trades at a discount to its Bitcoin net asset value, highlighting rising balance-sheet risk. Gemini will shut operations in the UK, EU, and Australia and cut 200 jobs , refocusing its business on the US market. The exchange cited AI-driven productivity gains and a strategic pivot toward prediction markets as the broader crypto market downturn intensifies pressure. The Crypto Market Lost $266 Billion The total crypto market cap fell $266 billion in the past 24 hours, dropping to $2.19 trillion at the time of writing. TOTAL is barely holding above the $2.12 trillion support. The decline was driven by cascading liquidations totaling nearly $2.2 billion, intensifying broad market pressure. The $2.12 trillion level now represents the market’s final defense. A breakdown could expose TOTAL to a decline to $2.00 trillion. Continued weakness across major tokens raises concerns about recovery timing, as rebuilding confidence may require sustained inflows and reduced volatility. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . TOTAL Price Analysis. Source: TradingView A rebound remains possible if investor sentiment stabilizes. Should deleveraging slow and demand return, TOTAL could defend $2.12 trillion. A successful bounce from this level may allow the total crypto market cap to recover part of the recent losses and ease near-term downside risk. Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin Falls To Its Lowest In 28 Months Bitcoin’s price dropped 11.6% in the past 24 hours, trading at $64,536 at the time of writing. The move marked Bitcoin’s largest single-day decline of 2026. Despite heavy selling, BTC remains above the $62,893 support, which has so far prevented a deeper breakdown. Selling pressure continues to rise amid investor uncertainty and heightened volatility. Market structure now points to $59,986 as the next major support below $60,000. A confirmed breakdown could accelerate losses, sending Bitcoin toward $55,883 as liquidity thins and risk aversion dominates short-term positioning. Bitcoin Price Analysis. Source: TradingView A recovery scenario depends on renewed bullish momentum. If buyers regain control, Bitcoin could reclaim $65,360 and challenge $69,922. A move above $70,000 would signal stabilization and open the path toward $75,000, allowing BTC to recover a meaningful portion of its recent losses. Stable Is Unstable STABLE price fell 23.4% over the last 24 hours, trading at $0.0196 at the time of writing. The sharp decline reflects heightened selling pressure across smaller-cap tokens. Despite the drop, STABLE continues to hold above the $0.0189 support, a level that previously triggered short-term rebounds. Rising outflows have dragged STABLE further away from its $0.0325 all-time high. Persistent distribution signals weaken investor confidence. If selling pressure continues, price action suggests a move toward the $0.0165 local support, which represents the next area of potential demand amid deteriorating market conditions. STABLE Price Analysis. Source: TradingView A recovery scenario remains viable if buyers defend the $0.0189 support. A successful bounce from this level could push STABLE back toward $0.0225. Reclaiming that zone would invalidate the bearish thesis, ease downside pressure, and provide the altcoin with temporary relief from recent losses.

Bitcoin’s price fell to $60,030, erasing gains made since its October peak near $126,000. This drop also wiped out the entire “Trump bump” rally from November 2024, as selling pressure increased from miners, profit-taking, deleveraging, and global market fears. Bitcoin Price Drop Linked to Miner Selling Pressure One of the biggest pressures is coming from Bitcoin miners. Data shows that the average cost to mine one Bitcoin has now risen above $87,000. With Bitcoin currently trading near $65,000, many miners are operating at a loss. To cover expenses, they are being forced to sell their holdings. Bitcoin miner Reserves have fallen consistently over the past months and now stand near 1.806 million BTC. This indicates that miners are selling more coins than they are keeping, adding to market supply. Bitcoin ETFs Record Heavy Outflows At the same time, institutional demand has weakened sharply. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw heavy outflows again. On February 5, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $258.8 million in net withdrawals. Although this was lower than the $544.9 million outflow seen a day earlier, the total outflows for the week have already crossed $1.07 billion. Liquidations Add More Pressure on BTC Price Liquidations also played a major role in pushing prices lower. In just 24 hours, more than $2.65 billion worth of leveraged crypto positions were wiped out. Around 82% of these liquidations came from long traders who were betting on higher prices. The single largest liquidation happened on Binance, where a BTCUSDT position worth $12 million was forcibly closed. Michael Saylor’s Strategy In Big Losses Even major corporate Bitcoin holders felt the pain. Michael Saylor’s Strategy reported an unrealized loss of about $9 billion, equal to 16% of its massive Bitcoin holdings. Despite this, Saylor urged investors to stay calm and “HODL.” Yet some leaders, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, reminded traders of Warren Buffett’s famous advice: be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. Bitcoin Price Outlook Bitcoin is now testing one of its most important support levels in years. If the price fails to hold above $60,000, analysts warn that more downside could follow. Even traders on the prediction market Kalshi expect Bitcoin to touch $58,000 in 2026. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs Why is the Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin crashed nearly 15% due to miners selling at a loss, over $1 billion in ETF outflows, and $2.65 billion in leveraged positions being liquidated in a single day. What could help Bitcoin recover after this sharp crash? A recovery typically needs reduced selling pressure, stabilizing miner activity, slowing ETF outflows, and renewed spot buying at key support levels. Will institutional investors return after ETF outflows? Institutions often re-enter gradually once volatility settles and price levels appear attractive relative to long-term fundamentals. What signs should investors watch for a Bitcoin recovery? Key signs include declining liquidations, stable miner reserves, ETF inflows, and higher trading volume near support levels.

Between November 2024 and July 2025, XRP surged from roughly $0.40 to an all-time high near $3.66. That move ranked among the most aggressive expansions across large-cap cryptocurrencies. Those gains have since retraced sharply. At press time, XRP traded near $1.44, down about 61% from its peak. Market structure suggested downside risks remained active. Capital exits gain momentum Ripple [XRP] recorded rising capital outflows over recent sessions, adding sustained pressure to price action. The Realized Cap Impulse, which tracks net capital entering or leaving the network, turned decisively lower. The indicator slid toward negative territory, signaling dominant outflows. That move reflected a behavioral shift. Market participants appeared focused on profit realization and capital preservation as trend confidence weakened. Having said that, Spot exchange data showed a different trend. XRP logged consistent weekly Exchange Outflows since the week beginning the 8th of September 2025. During the latest week, roughly $89 million worth of XRP exited exchanges. That divergence suggested retail holders largely maintained exposure, possibly anticipating a recovery that has yet to materialize. On-chain metrics flash a warning On-chain valuation metrics added further caution. The MVRV Z-Score hovered near the zero line, a level often marking major regime transitions. Alphractal described this zone as decisive for XRP’s broader trend. “MVRV Z-Score is sitting right on the key level that defines either a bear market continuation or the last on-chain support.” Source: Alphractal A sustained break below zero could intensify distribution. While such conditions often precede long-term bottoms, near-term selling pressure typically increases. A similar setup appeared in the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss metric. NUPL also hovered near its transition line. A drop into negative territory would indicate most XRP holders moving into unrealized losses, a scenario that historically accelerates exit behavior. Chart structure points to a $1 risk From a technical perspective, XRP remained vulnerable unless it firmly defended its current demand zone. That area still contained clustered bids, leaving room for a reaction bounce. Even so, weak upside follow-through raised the risk of a deeper decline. Failure to hold support could open a move toward the $1 region, aligning with the next major demand zone. Such a drop would represent roughly a 72% retracement from XRP’s all-time high. Source: TradingView On top of that, the Accumulation/Distribution indicator continued trending lower, approaching its April 2025 lows. The reading suggested persistent distribution pressure. Still, the indicator remained positive, implying earlier accumulation had not fully unwound. That balance left XRP at a critical juncture. For now, sellers retained control, and XRP’s response around key support levels may determine whether stabilization emerges or downside extends. Final Thoughts Capital outflows strengthened even as some spot holders continued accumulating XRP. This divergence raised a key question: are buyers positioning early, or misreading broader market risk?b6:Tb4c,Kalshi says it’s expanding its surveillance on its prediction markets platform through an independent advisory committee and partnerships to detect insider trading and market manipulation, just days ahead of the Super Bowl. Kalshi said on Thursday that the committee would give a quarterly rundown to the company’s outside counsel and publish statistics on investigations into suspicious activity on the platform. It is also teaming up with crypto trading surveillance platform Solidus Labs and Daniel Taylor, director of the Wharton Forensic Analytics Lab, “to detect, investigate, and address market abuse.” The move comes three days before Super Bowl 60, one of the biggest sporting events in the US, with more than $168 million in bets already placed on Kalshi. Source: Dan Taylor Regulators and Congress are also closely scrutinizing prediction markets, with federal lawmakers introducing a bill last month to restrict trading by government insiders after a Polymarket user made thousands on bets tied to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, placing wagers days before US forces captured him in Caracas. Kalshi is also among a handful of prediction markets targeted by US state regulators, who claim that sports event contracts constitute illegal gambling, a claim Kalshi and other companies have rejected. Alongside Wharton’s Taylor, Kalshi’s surveillance committee also includes Lisa Pinheiro, a managing principal and data scientist at Analysis Group, who focuses on market manipulation. Kalshi’s lawyer, Robert DeNault, was also appointed to head of enforcement to coordinate with the new committee. Brian Nelson, a former US Treasury official who worked on terrorism and financial intelligence matters, was also hired to advise on trading surveillance and compliance issues. Kalshi eyes offering margin trades: Report The Financial Times reported on Thursday that Kalshi is seeking regulatory approval to offer margin trades in the US. Related: Polymarket, Circle partner in shift to native USDC settlement People familiar with the matter told the FT that the approval is part of a move to open up to more institutional investors. Margin trades on event contracts could reportedly be structured like traditional futures contracts, where investors deposit a fraction of the contract’s face value and settle in full when it closes. Kalshi has reportedly been in talks with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for several months to enable margin trading.

Feb 6, 2026, 3:27 a.m. Bitcoin's Wall Street-like fear gauge has spiked to its highest level since the collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022, signaling intense market panic as prices plummeted to nearly $60,000. Volmex's bitcoin volatility index (BVIV), which represents the annualized expected price turbulence over four weeks, jumped to nearly 100% from 56% on Thursday. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The index serves as a crypto equivalent to Cboe's VIX, the so-called fear/panic gauge, which indicates the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 and rises during market panics as traders bid up options prices to hedge against declines in the index. The BVIV does the same more often than not, rising during market panics as observed on Thursday. "A wave of panic swept through crypto markets this week, correlated to a sharp risk-off move across various asset classes. Bitcoin’s 30-day implied volatility, as measured by the BVIV Index, surged from just over 40 to 95 in a matter of days, levels not seen since the infamous collapse of FTX at the end of 2022," Cole Kennelly, founder and CEO of Volmex Labs, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. Implied volatility is influenced by demand for options, or derivative contracts that help traders make asymmetrical gains from uptrends in the underlying asset and hedge downside risks. Call options are used to bet on the upside, while put options are typically bought as insurance against price drops. On Thursday, traders scrambled to buy Deribit-listed options, especially puts, as bitcoin's price tanked from $70,000 to nearly $60,000. The top five most traded options of the past 24 hours are all puts at strikes ranging from $70,000 to $20,000, according to data source Deribit Metrics. The $20,000 put represents a bet that prices will fall below that level. "Volatility markets reacted sharply to last night's price drop. Front-end volatility surged as dealers adjusted for gamma [near-term risks]. Short-dated vols led the surge, showing higher demand for protection, while longer-dated vols lagged, keeping the volatility curve steeply inverted," Jimmy Yang, co-founder of institutional liquidity provider Orbit Markets, told CoinDesk. Yang's clients rushed to buy downside protection, fearing the price crash could devastate digital asset treasuries that bought bitcoin at higher levels. These firms could now liquidate at a loss, leading to a deeper slide in bitcoin's price. "With significant uncertainty still ahead — particularly around the DATs and the risk of further unwind cascades, we've seen a lot of client demand for downside protection," he added. Bitcoin's price has bounced to over $64,000 at the time of writing, an over 5% recovery from overnight lows, according to CoinDesk data. Yang expects volatility to stabilize. "Sentiment is deep in extreme fear, but bitcoin's price seems to have found a base near $60K. If price action stabilizes, volatility looks stretched and could quickly pull back," he said.b8:T85f,U.S.-Iran warning resurfaces ahead of nuclear talks, further pressuring bitcoin and crypto markets Traders are likely to treat geopolitical headlines as catalysts for volatility rather than clear directional signals for crypto prices. Updated Feb 6, 2026, 4:07 a.m. Published Feb 6, 2026, 3:27 a.m. A U.S. advisory urging American citizens to “leave Iran now” is circulating again online, adding another layer of headline risk to a crypto market already wobbling on high volatility and forced liquidations. 🚨BREAKING: The US Governments tells its citizen to LEAVE IRAN IMMEDIATELY. Could this be why the markets nuked today? Are we going to war? pic.twitter.com/ZmnGDSUJcf — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) February 6, 2026 STORY CONTINUES BELOW Officials have since clarified the warning itself is not new and was first issued in mid-January. Still, the timing matters. The advisory is resurfacing just as the U.S. and Iran prepare to hold nuclear talks in Oman on Friday, with President Donald Trump publicly warning Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Tehran threatening retaliation if attacked. For crypto traders, the immediate takeaway is not whether the advisory is fresh. It’s that the market is behaving like a fragile, leveraged macro trade. In this kind of environment, geopolitical headlines tend to hit bitcoin the same way they hit high-beta tech stocks, not the way they hit gold. Bitcoin has already been swinging wildly after a week of liquidation-driven selling, and the market’s sensitivity is elevated. When positioning is stretched and liquidity is thin, even ambiguous news can trigger rapid deleveraging, especially in perpetual futures. The asset has repeatedly sold off whenever geopolitical drama makes headlines, with investors preferring the perceived safety of gold or bonds against digital assets. The Iran headlines may ultimately fade, especially if the Oman talks proceed smoothly. But in a market that is still digesting heavy losses and where sentiment is already brittle, traders are likely to treat geopolitics as a volatility accelerant rather than a directional catalyst.b9:T92c,Bitcoin surges back above $65,000 after $700 million wipeout in Asia whipsaw BTC fell as much as 4.8% to around $60,033 during late U.S. hours, before snapping back to as high as $65,926. Feb 6, 2026, 3:17 a.m. Bitcoin rebounded sharply in Asia on Friday after a fresh wave of selling briefly pushed the token toward $60,000, extending a brutal drawdown that has now taken the world’s largest cryptocurrency more than 50% below its October peak. BTC fell as much as 4.8% to around $60,033 during late U.S. hours, before snapping back to as high as $65,926. The move followed Thursday’s 13% slide, bitcoin’s steepest one-day drop since November 2022, when the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX triggered a marketwide panic. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The bounce came as liquidations surged again, clearing out leveraged positions that had built up during the week’s decline. Roughly $700 million in crypto bets were wiped out over the past four hours, according to liquidation tracker CoinGlass, including about $530 million in long positions and $170 million in shorts. That mix suggests traders were first crushed on the way down, then caught leaning the wrong way on the rebound. The move also appears to have drawn in spot buyers, with $60,000 acting as a psychological line that traders have been watching for weeks. Damien Loh, chief investment officer at Ericsenz Capital, said the rebound points to “strong support” around that level, but warned sentiment remains fragile given the broader market backdrop. Altcoins mirrored bitcoin’s whipsaw. Solana at one point fell as much as 14% before erasing those losses entirely within hours, shows how quickly risk appetite is flipping as liquidity thins and forced selling takes over. The broader crypto market has been shaky since a series of liquidations in October rattled confidence, and the latest drawdown has been amplified by turbulence in global markets, where investors have been dumping speculative assets. Bitcoin’s weakness is now spilling into crypto-linked balance sheets. Strategy, the company led by Michael Saylor, reported a $12.4 billion fourth-quarter net loss on Thursday, driven by mark-to-market declines in its bitcoin holdings. Even with Friday’s bounce, traders say the market still looks like one being pushed around by leverage rather than conviction.ba:Tde6,In brief IREN and CleanSpark shares fell sharply after both companies missed revenue estimates in their latest earnings reports. The results landed as Bitcoin contines its slide, amplifying pressure on publicly traded miners. Investors appeared focused on near-term execution and balance-sheet risk despite both companies’ push into AI infrastructure. Publicly traded Bitcoin miners IREN and CleanSpark saw their share prices drop sharply on Thursday, as disappointing quarterly results coincided with a broader crash across cryptocurrency markets. CleanSpark shares closed sharply lower, falling $1.95, around 19%, on the session, and were trading at $7.55 in after-hours trading. IREN shares fell $5.11, or 11%, during the day and were trading at $32.42 after the close, according to MarketWatch. The downturn underscores the ongoing financial volatility for miners and investors as they navigate fluctuating asset prices and infrastructure expenses. IREN reported $184.7 million in revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2025, down from $240.3 million in the prior quarter. The company posted a net loss of $155.4 million, reversing $384.6 million in net income reported in the previous period. The company said the quarter reflected a transition as it shifts from Bitcoin mining toward AI cloud infrastructure. Results included significant non-cash and non-recurring items, including $219.2 million in unrealized losses tied to financial instruments and a one-time debt conversion inducement expense, as well as $31.8 million in mining hardware impairments related to an ongoing ASIC-to-GPU transition across its British Columbia operations. Even though the company's stock slid, Daniel Roberts, co-founder and co-CEO of IREN, said the company continued to make progress during the quarter as it expanded its AI cloud business. “Last quarter marked meaningful progress across capacity expansion, customer engagement, and capital formation, reflecting IREN’s progress as a scaled AI Cloud platform,” Roberts said in a statement on X. CleanSpark also reported quarterly results that fell short of expectations. The company posted $181.2 million in revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, up from a year earlier, but reported a net loss of $378.7 million, compared with net income in the same quarter last year. CleanSpark said the loss was driven largely by non-cash items tied to Bitcoin price movements and asset revaluations. As of quarter-end, the company reported $458 million in cash, $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings, and $1.3 billion in working capital, alongside $1.8 billion in long-term debt. The earnings reports landed during a broad selloff across cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin falling more than 11% on the day. The decline has weighed on publicly traded miners and other crypto-exposed companies, increasing scrutiny of earnings volatility and balance-sheet exposure. Despite the sell-off, CleanSpark President and CFO Gary A. Vecchiarelli tried to paint an optimistic picture. "Bitcoin mining generates the cash flow, AI infrastructure monetizes the assets over the long term, and our Digital Asset Management function optimizes capital and liquidity across cycles.," he wrote on X. "This approach gives us flexibility and provides the framework to allocate capital where returns are most attractive, a combination we believe is increasingly rare in today’s market.” Daily Debrief Newsletter Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.bb:T7ce,Volatility in digital assets deepens as investors reevaluate their strategies amid global pressures and tightening regulations. Crypto traders faced one of the most brutal resets on Thursday after Bitcoin’s free fall wiped out roughly $2.7 billion in leverage positions in the last 24 hours. As the panic escalates, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , which tracks investor sentiment using factors such as volatility, trading volume, and Bitcoin’s dominance, has fallen to 9, its lowest reading since June 2022. Bitcoin is trading above $65,000, reflecting a roughly 10% decline in the past day. Bitcoin has trimmed some of its losses after briefly testing the $60,000 level, but analysts warn that capitulation risks are rising as most BTC supply is now underwater . According to Gerry O’Shea, Head of Global Market Insights at global crypto asset manager Hashdex, Bitcoin has been pressured by global uncertainty linked to AI, geopolitics, and macroeconomic conditions, which has driven investors away from risk assets. He said investors still favor gold as a store of value, but expects Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative to strengthen over time as adoption grows and regulation becomes clearer. “We believe, however, that despite this recent drawdown, Bitcoin will continue to increase its appeal as ‘digital gold’ in portfolios as more institutions allow access to BTC and more individuals understand its thesis as a non-sovereign, immutable asset,” O’Shea said in a Thursday note. “In the near term, we expect continued price volatility to track alongside important developments such as the integration of digital assets into financial infrastructure, increasing regulatory clarity, and traditional platforms giving their clients access to Bitcoin and other digital assets,” he stated. The analyst believes that meaningful progress on the CLARITY Act could support a market recovery in the months ahead, voicing confidence in Senate efforts to pass the bill this year.bc:Tb70,Crypto market sentiment has slumped to its lowest level in over three and a half years, with Bitcoin falling by double-digit percentage points to around $60,000. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to a score of 9 out of 100 on Friday, indicating “extreme fear” in the market and hitting its lowest point since June 2022, when sentiment and the market fell in the wake of the collapse of the Terra blockchain a month earlier. The index has been at a low for the last fortnight as Bitcoin ( BTC ) has tanked 38% from its 2026 high of $97,000 in just three weeks, wiping out all gains for the past sixteen months.

Read our Editorial Policy https://cointelegraph.com/editorial-policybe:T1248,A newly created wallet deposited $4 million in USDC into Hyperliquid, then opened a 3x leveraged SOL short, signaling clear downside conviction from fresh capital. This action shows clear downside intent rather than hedging behavior. The trader chose moderate leverage, which suggests confidence without excessive liquidation risk. Meanwhile, the entry occurred as Solana [SOL] traded below key structural levels. That timing strengthens the bearish read. Additionally, fresh wallets often signal new information or a strong macro view. However, this short does not exist in isolation. It directly contrasts broader market positioning. Therefore, the trade introduces asymmetry, where few large players absorb downside risk while many smaller traders expect upside. Sellers defend structure as momentum weakens Solana remained locked inside a well-defined descending channel on the daily chart at press time, with price continuing to respect lower highs and lower lows. The recent rejection near the $120 region proved critical, as it aligned with both horizontal resistance and the channel midpoint. The failure accelerated downside pressure and pushed Solana below the $100 handle, reinforcing bearish control. Above, the $147.85 level remained a key invalidation zone, as repeated failures there confirmed distribution rather than consolidation. Meanwhile, price traded near the lower channel boundary around $90, a zone that previously offered only brief pauses. Momentum reinforces this weakness. The daily RSI has slipped toward 23, reflecting sustained selling pressure rather than capitulation. Significantly, RSI has not printed a bullish divergence, and prior rebounds stalled below 40, showing weak recovery attempts. Therefore, if $90 fails to hold decisively, SOL could extend lower toward the $80 support, where historical demand and psychological interest may re-emerge. Source: TradingView Solana top traders lean long despite pressure Binance top trader data shows long accounts near 82%, while short accounts remain close to 18%. This positioning pushes the long-to-short ratio above 4.5. Such skew highlights crowded bullish exposure. Many traders expect a rebound despite the downtrend. However, heavy long concentration increases downside risk. When price fails to recover, forced unwinds often follow. Additionally, this positioning contrasts sharply with the HyperLiquid whale short. Therefore, sentiment diverges between concentrated capital and aggregated accounts. This imbalance creates vulnerability. If price stalls or slips further, long liquidation pressure could intensify rapidly. Leverage resets as Open Interest falls Open Interest has declined by roughly 4.37%, dropping to about $6.19B. This contraction signals leverage reduction across derivatives markets. Traders appear to close positions rather than add aggressively. However, declining Open Interest during falling price often reflects long exits. That interpretation fits the positioning skew. Moreover, reduced leverage does not remove directional risk. It simply resets exposure. Therefore, the market now carries less leverage but remains directionally imbalanced. If price fails to stabilize, new leverage could be rebuilt on the short side. That shift would extend volatility rather than suppress it. Long liquidations dominate Solana’s recent activity Liquidation data showed longs absorbing the majority of recent pressure. Total long liquidations reached roughly $3.59 million, while shorts faced about $733K. This imbalance confirmed downside stress on bullish positioning. Binance, Bybit, and OKX all recorded heavier long liquidations. Hyperliquid also showed more long pressure than shorts. These events occurred as SOL traded near $90. Therefore, price weakness already forces leveraged longs out. However, liquidation clusters remain relatively modest so far. That leaves room for further downside-driven flushes if price fails to hold current levels. Conclusively, Solana sat at a critical junction where structure, momentum, and positioning clash. A well-capitalized short contrasts sharply with a crowded long exposure. Weak RSI and a descending channel support downside continuation. Declining Open Interest suggests cleanup, not relief. If price stalls near support, long pressure could accelerate. Therefore, Solana may indeed face a forced deleveraging phase before any durable recovery emerges. Final Thoughts SOL continues to respect a descending channel with repeated failures at the midpoint and horizontal resistance near $120.

This positioning pushes the long-to-short ratio above 4.5. Such skew highlights crowded bullish exposure. Many traders expect a rebound despite the downtrend. However, heavy long concentration increases downside risk. When price fails to recover, forced unwinds often follow. Additionally, this positioning contrasts sharply with the HyperLiquid whale short. Therefore, sentiment diverges between concentrated capital and aggregated accounts. This imbalance creates vulnerability. If price stalls or slips further, long liquidation pressure could intensify rapidly. Leverage resets as Open Interest falls Open Interest has declined by roughly 4.37%, dropping to about $6.19B. This contraction signals leverage reduction across derivatives markets. Traders appear to close positions rather than add aggressively. However, declining Open Interest during falling price often reflects long exits. That interpretation fits the positioning skew. Moreover, reduced leverage does not remove directional risk. It simply resets exposure. Therefore, the market now carries less leverage but remains directionally imbalanced. If price fails to stabilize, new leverage could be rebuilt on the short side. That shift would extend volatility rather than suppress it. Long liquidations dominate Solana’s recent activity Liquidation data showed longs absorbing the majority of recent pressure. Total long liquidations reached roughly $3.59 million, while shorts faced about $733K. This imbalance confirmed downside stress on bullish positioning. Binance, Bybit, and OKX all recorded heavier long liquidations. Hyperliquid also showed more long pressure than shorts. These events occurred as SOL traded near $90. Therefore, price weakness already forces leveraged longs out. However, liquidation clusters remain relatively modest so far. That leaves room for further downside-driven flushes if price fails to hold current levels. Conclusively, Solana sat at a critical junction where structure, momentum, and positioning clash. A well-capitalized short contrasts sharply with a crowded long exposure. Weak RSI and a descending channel support downside continuation. Declining Open Interest suggests cleanup, not relief. If price stalls near support, long pressure could accelerate. Therefore, Solana may indeed face a forced deleveraging phase before any durable recovery emerges. Final Thoughts SOL continues to respect a descending channel with repeated failures at the midpoint and horizontal resistance near $120. A newly created wallet deployed $4 million into HyperLiquid and opened a 3x leveraged SOL short, signaling directional conviction.c0:T1618,QCP's Darius Sit says October's deleveraging event exposed the real divide: bitcoin trades like collateral, altcoins trade like a bet on exchange governance Feb 6, 2026, 2:36 a.m. Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The market has been asking whether bitcoin is losing to gold. Darius Sit, co-founder and Managing Partner at QCP Capital, says the debate is often framed around price when liquidity realities matter more. Singapore-based QCP is one of Asia's largest trading desks, with over $60 billion in annual volume. STORY CONTINUES BELOW “If you’re comparing Bitcoin to gold, it’s not a like-for-like comparison… you’re talking about almost like a mouse versus an elephant kind of comparison,” Sit told CoinDesk. “You have two different sets of idiosyncratic market forces affecting market price in the short term, but on the longer-term narrative, I think, [they] remain quite similar.” Gold’s dominance reflects sovereign demand, entrenched market structure, and sheer scale. Bitcoin’s lag owes more to position unwinds than thesis collapse. Gold’s market cap is so large that its daily swings can exceed bitcoin’s entire valuation, turning short-term divergence into a physics problem rather than a narrative verdict. However, “in the longer term, narrative looks the same,” Sit said. A bigger inflection point, in his view, isn’t bullion’s rally but crypto’s Oct. 10 (now called 10/10) deleveraging event. That episode drew a hard line between bitcoin and the rest of the digital asset complex, exposing how liquidity and credit mitigation diverge once leverage snaps. “October 10 revealed that … there is a very clear line in terms of the liquidity between crypto, altcoins and bitcoin,” Sit said. The takeaway isn’t that crypto lost its appeal, but that much of the market discovered its true depth only after forced unwinds cleared the book. What remained was a thinner landscape where price moves sharply in either direction. One of the most important lessons of "10/10" was how crypto venues handle credit when things break. Sit drew a stark contrast with traditional markets, where layered broker and clearinghouse structures absorb shocks before losses reach end users. Native crypto exchanges, by comparison, often operate as single points of failure, relying on shareholder equity, insurance funds, and, in extreme cases, socialized loss. “The moment you trigger socialized loss, your platform will lose trust,” Sit said, describing what he views as the industry’s real institutional ceiling. Volatility isn’t the deterrent. The problem emerges when traders cannot predict how liquidations and counterparty risk will be managed in a stress event. Socialized loss occurs when an exchange's insurance fund cannot cover bankrupt positions, forcing the platform to close out profitable traders' positions to cover the shortfall, effectively making winners pay for others' losses. This happened on many major exchanges during the Oct. 10 market crash. He added that participants perceived the rules as inconsistent, with some products or counterparties appearing insulated while others absorbed the hit. That perception lingers longer than the price drawdown itself. Markets can rebuild leverage and volume, but trust in liquidation governance is slower to return. The result is a divided landscape where bitcoin retains credibility due to deeper liquidity and clearer use as collateral, while the broader altcoin complex trades with a structural discount tied less to macro direction than to venue design and counterparty confidence. In Sit’s view, bitcoin still behaves like a long-horizon inflation hedge and an increasingly legible form of collateral, whereas the broader altcoin universe is more directly subject to venue governance and order-book depth than to macro narratives alone. “When something has poor liquidity, it can go down a lot. It can go up a lot,” Sit said. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin swung violently but edged up about 5% in the last hour as extreme volatility followed a liquidation-driven plunge toward $60,000, with the RSI near 17 signaling historically oversold conditions that often precede sharp relief bounces even as price hovers near the $58,000 to $60,000 support zone. ETH: Ether traded around $1,895, rebounding about 7% in the past hour after a liquidation-driven selloff, with volatility surging as deeply oversold momentum conditions triggered a short-term relief bounce despite double-digit losses over the past 24 hours. Gold: Gold slipped about 3.7% to roughly $4,740 per ounce in a broad risk-asset pullback and profit-taking wave, but analysts argue the longer-term uptrend remains supported by persistent central-bank buying, debt and currency-confidence concerns, and forecasts that still see potential for prices to push toward $7,000 later in 2026 despite short-term volatility. Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 slipped about 1% to extend a three-day losing streak as a Wall Street tech rout spilled into Asia, dragging South Korea’s Kospi down as much as 5%, pressuring Hong Kong and Australian equities, and reinforcing a broader risk-off tone that also weighed on silver and other volatile assets.

Bitcoin fell below $65,000, hitting a one-year low as capital rotated away from crypto toward profit-backed assets. The divergence highlights a clear risk split, with investors favoring earnings visibility over liquidity-driven trades. US equities rebounded as the S&P 500 climbed to $6,976, before correcting. Earlier in the week, the benchmark index closed just shy of its prior record before briefly moving higher in subsequent trading, while risk appetite in equities contrasted sharply with continued weakness across crypto markets. At the same time, Bitcoin continued to underperform , with selling pressure accelerating as broader capital flows favored traditional risk assets. The divergence has become more pronounced in recent sessions, reinforcing the growing split between equity and crypto sentiment. S&P 500 Year-to-Date Chart Sponsored Sponsored AI Stocks and Small Caps Drive Equity Momentum The latest leg higher in the S&P 500 was led by large-cap technology and semiconductor stocks, as investors rotated back into AI-linked names after a brief pause driven by valuation concerns. Alphabet rose to a new record, Amazon advanced ahead of earnings, and chipmakers posted broad-based gains as demand expectations firmed. Beneath the surface, market breadth also improved. Small-cap stocks outpaced megacaps, with the Russell 2000 gaining around 3% year-to-date. That relative strength is often interpreted as a signal of confidence in domestic growth and has added support to broader stock market predictions that point to continued upside as long as earnings momentum holds.

Analysts now expect S&P 500 companies to deliver close to 11% earnings growth for the December quarter, up sharply from estimates earlier in January.

Recent research suggests earnings growth has accounted for roughly 84% of total S&P 500 returns in the current cycle, marking a shift away from multiple expansion as the primary engine of gains. This transition has softened concerns around an AI-driven bubble, as profits and cash flow increasingly justify higher prices.

AI investment, small-cap strength, and resilient macro data continue to support the upside case, even as record levels invite selective caution. Bitcoin’s slide to a one-year low highlights where risk appetite is thinning, but for now, equity markets remain firmly in control of the broader risk narrative.

The selloff triggered more than $1.4 billion in liquidations as leverage continues to unwind across the market. Analysts told Decrypt price action meets bear-market definitions, though some see scope for a short-term technical rebound. Bitcoin’s sharp retreat from its late 2025 peak, capped by its worst single-day drop since the 2022 market crash, has reignited concerns that crypto has already entered a bear market under conventional definitions. Between February 4 and 5, Bitcoin logged one of its sharpest trading periods in more than three years, posting a roughly 14% single-day decline, the largest since a 14.19% drop on November 9, 2022, according to historical data on CoinGlass. Bitcoin’s price fell from around $73,100 to a low near $60,255 by Thursday evening, extending Bitcoin’s drawdown to more than 50% from its October 2025 all-time high of $126,080, and triggering more than $1.4 billion in liquidations over a 24-hour period, according to data from CoinGlass. The world's largest crypto has since clawed back losses, trading down more than 10% on the day to $64,400, CoinGecko data shows. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s drawdowns have exceeded thresholds commonly used to define bear markets in equities and other risk assets. The move has unfolded alongside persistent weakness in broader risk sentiment . A bear market is typically defined as a decline of about 20% or more from a recent peak in a price or a broad market index over a sustained period of time, typically more than a few months. The downturn has shifted attention toward stress points across the crypto ecosystem, particularly Bitcoin miners and corporate crypto treasuries , as falling prices squeeze margins and weaken balance sheets, raising the risk of capitulation, consolidation, or forced selling. Some analysts warn the selloff may not be finished. They point to deteriorating momentum, leverage unwinds, and macro pressure as factors that could push Bitcoin toward lower support levels, with $38,000 cited as a potential downside target if selling accelerates. When asked by Decrypt whether the industry was in the midst of a crypto winter, Vice President of research at GSR, Carlos Guzman, said he wasn't "entirely sure." “We’ve historically seen a four-year cycle, and it has tended to be fairly consistent, but I don’t think there’s a strong fundamental reason for it," Guzman said. "To some extent, it’s self-fulfilling; investors expect a four-year cycle, and so it plays out that way." "That said, I see the fundamentals improving," he added. "It’s hard for me to believe we’re heading into an extended winter. It remains to be seen, and markets can always prove me wrong, but in my view the four-year cycle may be coming to an end, and I don’t expect a prolonged downturn.” Based solely on price action, it is evident that the crypto industry has “entered a bear market,” Siwon Huh, researcher at crypto analytics firm Four Pillars, told Decrypt . The defining distinction between a bear market and a temporary downturn, Huh explained, “is the duration required for price recovery.” “Since the broader tech and software sector effectively dictates the direction of global liquidity, the crypto market will inevitably remain tethered to macroeconomic trends as long as this dynamic persists,” he added. Still, despite the transition to a bear market, market movements over the past two weeks have been “erratic, almost to the point of feeling artificial,” Huh noted. Huh said the “critical factor defining this bear market” entry is the “high likelihood that liquidity exiting the market will flow back into equities or commodities rather than returning to crypto.” “Since the primary driver appears to be a decline stemming from psychological risk-off sentiment, I believe there is a strong possibility of a significant short-term technical rebound,” he said, adding that the underlying fundamentals remain unchanged.

At press time, Zcash traded near $245 after breaking below the $300 support, which has now flipped into resistance. As momentum weakened, sellers pushed the price toward the $240–$244 support zone, marking the near-term downside target. Source: TradingView If this area fails, downside risk could expand toward the $200–$210 psychological zone, where deeper demand may emerge. Meanwhile, resistance sits between $260 and $280, with $300 acting as the key structural barrier for any sustained recovery. Although MACD compression and stretched price conditions hinted at oversold levels, any rebound required stronger volume and macro support. Without that backing, relief rallies were likely to fade into renewed selling pressure. Beyond price action, privacy-coin headwinds remained visible. Regulatory scrutiny and competition from newer privacy solutions continued to weigh on sentiment. Bears retained control below $300, while a loss of $240 exposed ZEC to a deeper slide toward $200. Demand rebuilds above $240 following capitulation In the lower timeframe, Zcash [ZEC] completed a sharp capitulation move, declining from around $270 into the $238–$240 demand zone, where downside momentum began to ease. This zone reflected prior accumulation, largely created by reactive buyers and short-term traders who previously absorbed sell pressure at these levels. As price revisits it, the same participant cohort steps in again, reinforcing the floor. Source: TradingView At the lows, buyers responded firmly, printing a hammer candle with a long lower wick that rejected prices below $240. That rejection shifted short-term order flow, as price stabilized instead of extending losses. Two consecutive green candles then formed a higher low near $244–$246, strengthening early recovery signals. Meanwhile, RSI hovered near oversold territory, reflecting stretched downside conditions rather than fresh bearish expansion. The indicator’s modest uptick suggested that selling momentum was fading. Price held above the $240 psychological level, pointing to dip demand strength as forced selling subsided. Rebounds may now build toward the $260–$280 resistance zone, while a breakdown below $240 could accelerate losses toward $210. While the broader trend remained bearish, this reaction zone highlighted downside compression as positioning gradually reset. Final Thoughts Below $300, ZEC remains in a clear bearish structure with $240 acting as the key downside line before $200–$210 comes into play. Buyers are defending the $240 zone, but any recovery is capped unless the price reclaims the $260–$280 resistance range.c4:T9c7,Traders were active in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF on Thursday as Bitcoin plummeted, falling 12% in the last 24 hours. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has reportedly seen an all-time peak daily trading volume as traders responded to Bitcoin’s rapidly crashing price. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) “crushed its daily volume record” on Thursday, with $10 billion worth of shares trading hands, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X. Balchunas added that IBIT dropped 13% on the day, its “second-worst daily price drop since it launched,” with its biggest daily price crash coming in at 15% on May 8, 2024. Source: Eric Balchunas On Wednesday, IBIT posted net outflows totalling $373.4 million , with the ETF having just 10 trading days of net inflows so far in 2026. The ETF has struggled to maintain a consistent stream of inflows since a crypto market crash in early October, as the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to plummet. Bitcoin has dropped 12% in the past 24 hours to $64,000, climbing after hitting a low of $60,300. The cryptocurrency has fallen by around 50% since its all-time high of around $126,000 in early October, according to CoinGecko data . IBIT has followed a similar pattern, hitting a peak of almost $70 in early October, and has since dropped around 48% to sit at $36.10 as of the close of trading on Thursday.

The latest BTC crash comes as the market reacts to weak US job market data and growing concerns over the substantial capital being poured in the artificial intelligence sector. Analysts, such as veteran trader Peter Brandt, have argued the carnage may not be over , noting on Wednesday that Bitcoin is showing “fingerprints of campaign selling” with few buyers stepping in to prop the price up.

The company now trades below asset value, limiting its ability to raise capital without dilution. Risk remains manageable for now, but prolonged weakness could escalate financial strain. MicroStrategy is under renewed market pressure after Bitcoin slid to $60,000, pushing the company’s vast crypto treasury deeper below its average acquisition cost and reigniting concerns about balance-sheet risk. Shares of the company fell sharply as Bitcoin extended its sell-off, reflecting Strategy’s role as a leveraged proxy for the cryptocurrency. The stock’s decline also pushed its market valuation below the value of its underlying Bitcoin holdings. This is a key stress signal for the firm’s treasury model. Bitcoin Price Chart.

With Bitcoin now trading near $60,000, the company’s holdings are roughly 21% below cost basis , translating into billions of dollars in unrealized losses. While these losses are unrealized and do not force immediate asset sales, they materially weaken MicroStrategy’s equity story. The drawdown also shifts investor focus from long-term accumulation to short-term financial resilience. Bitcoin is Now $16,000 Below MicroStrategy’s Average Purchase Price. Source: Stra t egy Sponsored Sponsored Market Premium Collapses Below Asset Value A more immediate concern is MicroStrategy’s market net asset value (mNAV) , which has fallen to roughly 0.87x . This means the stock now trades at a discount to the value of the Bitcoin on its balance sheet. That discount matters because MicroStrategy’s strategy relies heavily on issuing equity at a premium to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. With the premium gone, issuing new shares would be dilutive rather than accretive, effectively freezing the company’s primary growth mechanism. Strategy’s Bitcoin Premium Collapses.

MicroStrategy previously raised around $18.6 billion through equity issuance over the past two years, largely at premiums to its net asset value. Those capital raises occurred during favorable market conditions and helped the company build its current Bitcoin position without excessive dilution.

After peaking at $136.63 million in January 2025, credit withdrawals plummeted to $22.04 million by November as volatility and stalled upside forced traders to reduce risk. This trend was paralleled by Ethereum borrowing on Aave, which surged to 1.2 million ETH at mid-2025 before collapsing to near 300,000 ETH by early 2026, signaling a widespread liquidity reset.

Although credit flows stabilized at historically low levels around $24 million in late 2025 and early 2026, suggesting a potential bottoming of demand, NEXO's price action remains bearish. The token has broken below key support levels at $0.901 and $0.947, currently trading near $0.73 with technical indicators like the RSI showing persistent weakness. This divergence indicates that while excess leverage is being cleared, market sentiment remains risk-off, requiring a significant price reclaim to stabilize the downtrend.c7:Tb62,ข้อมูลการถอนเครดิตปลีกของ NEXO ตั้งแต่ปี 2025 ถึงต้นปี 2026 เผยให้เห็นวงจรของการใช้เลเวอเรจอย่างก้าวร้าวตามด้วยการลดขนาดพอร์ต (Deleveraging) ซึ่งสะท้อนการเปลี่ยนแปลงของความอยากรับความเสี่ยงในตลาดคริปโต หลังจากพุ่งขึ้นสูงสุดที่ 136.63 ล้านดอลลาร์ในเดือนมกราคม 2025 การถอนเครดิตตกต่ำเหลือเพียง 22.04 ล้านดอลลาร์ในเดือนพฤศจิกายน เมื่อความผันผวนและการขาดแรงขับเคลื่อนของราคาบังคับให้นักเทรดลดความเสี่ยง แนวโน้มนี้สอดคล้องกับการยืม Ethereum บน Aave ที่พุ่งถึง 1.2 ล้าน ETH กลางปี 2025 ก่อนจะดิ่งลงเหลือเพียง 300,000 ETH ในต้นปี 2026 ซึ่งส่งสัญญาณการปรับฐานสภาพคล่องอย่างกว้างขวาง

This reflected aggressive leverage deployment during strong market conditions. As volatility rose, withdrawals fell to $85.3 million in February and $54.4 million in March, signaling forced balance-sheet tightening rather than organic demand cooling. This early deleveraging implied that retail participants began reducing risk as liquidity conditions shifted. Activity was then rebuilt. April climbed to $75.2 million, followed by $79.8 million in May and a local peak at $95.8 million in June, while MoM turned positive. This rebound suggested traders re-engaged leverage into recovering price momentum, using credit to re-enter risk assets. Source: CryptoQuant/ X However, the second half showed structural fatigue. Withdrawals fell to $67 million in July, hovered at $70 million in August, then slid to $48.5 million in September as market upside stalled. The decline later accelerated to $22.04 million by November, reflecting risk aversion, thinner liquidity, and reduced speculative appetite. This sustained deleveraging implied balance sheet resets while excess leverage cleared, and marginal buyers retreated. Withdrawals stabilize in December 2025 and January 2026 at $23.957 million and $23.965 million, respectively, holding close to their lowest levels. That flattening suggests credit demand may be bottoming, often a precursor to gradual market reaccumulation once confidence rebuilds. Credit growth meets liquidity stress Ethereum[ETH] borrowing on Aave [AAVE] began in 2024, subdued near 150,000 to 200,000 ETH , with rates around 2.5–3% amid stabilizing markets. Demand built steadily, reaching 400,000 ETH by October 2024 as traders increased leveraged positioning. Momentum accelerated into early 2025; utilization approached 800,000 ETH while rates spiked near 3.5%. Source: CryptoQuant/ X This signaled crowded leverage and rising collateral demand during strengthening ETH price trends. Borrowing peaked in mid-2025 near 1.2 million Ethereum [ETH], marking maximum speculative exposure. Thereafter, borrowing fell toward 600,000 ETH as deleveraging pressures emerged. By early 2026, utilization neared 300,000 ETH, and rates eased toward 1.5–2%, reflecting cooling risk appetite and leverage reset. Key support failure extends NEXO’s downtrend NEXO extended its downtrend as the price slipped below the $0.901 and $0.947 resistance bands, reinforcing the bearish structure. Selling pressure accelerated, driving the price into the $0.80 demand zone, where support briefly emerged. However, momentum weakened further as candles pierced the zone, pushing the price toward $0.73. Source: TradingView Moving averages trended downward and compressed above price, signaling sustained downside control. RSI hovered near 26, reflecting oversold conditions and weak reversal strength. This alignment showed persistent distribution rather than capitulation. As the breakdown structure held, market sentiment tilted risk-off, with bulls requiring a reclaim above $0.90 to stabilize the near-term price structure. Final Thoughts Leverage expanded sharply across credit markets before compressing, signaling a broad liquidity reset as risk appetite weakened. Credit flows stabilized, yet NEXO price continued falling, showing market sentiment remained risk-off despite leverage cooling.c9:T473,OpenAI and Anthropic have unveiled new flagship AI models, GPT-5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6 respectively, launching within an hour of each other to highlight the intensifying race for enterprise dominance. Anthropic's model emphasizes strengths in long-context reasoning and professional tasks like legal and financial analysis, while OpenAI's release focuses on optimizing agentic coding, software development, and research efficiency. Benchmark results indicate that neither model holds a definitive overall lead, as each excels in different specialized areas relevant to corporate needs.

The simultaneous releases reflect a broader trend where investors are reassessing traditional software providers amid fears that AI-native platforms will erode demand for established enterprise tools. As competition heats up with expected updates from Google and others, market leadership will likely be determined by broader enterprise adoption and the integration of agent-based workflows rather than benchmark scores alone.

Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4.6, touting gains in long-context reasoning and agent-based workflows, while OpenAI shortly after released GPT-5.3 Codex, a model optimized for agentic coding and software development. The near-simultaneous launches underscored how quickly rivals are iterating as companies race to secure long-term contracts with large corporate customers. Benchmark results suggested the two models are optimized for different strengths. Claude Opus 4.6 showed stronger performance on tasks tied to legal and financial reasoning, while GPT-5.3 Codex outperformed on agentic coding tests and efficiency metrics, according to figures released by both companies. The releases come as investors reassess the outlook for traditional software providers, with shares of several information and professional-services firms falling this week amid concerns that AI-native platforms could erode demand for established enterprise tools. Anthropic said that Claude Opus 4.6 delivered gains in long-context reasoning and professional tasks, citing a 1-million-token context window and a 76% score on MRCR v2, a benchmark for complex information retrieval. The company said the model also outperformed earlier versions on finance and legal tasks and introduced “agent teams” that allow multiple AI agents to work in parallel on coding and documentation. OpenAI released GPT-5.3 Codex shortly afterward, positioning it as a model optimized for agentic coding and research. OpenAI said Codex scored 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding benchmark where Claude Opus 4.6 scored 65.4%, and completed tasks faster while using fewer tokens. OpenAI also said early versions of Codex were used internally to help debug training and manage deployment, marking one of the first times a model played a direct role in accelerating its own development. Taken together, the results suggest neither model holds a clear overall lead, with performance advantages depending on whether enterprises prioritize professional reasoning or autonomous software development. Google is also expected to roll out updates to its Gemini models in the coming months, while other AI developers, including DeepSeek, are preparing new releases, adding to the pace of competition in the sector. Still, benchmark results alone are unlikely to determine market leadership, as broader adoption and enterprise deployment increasingly shape the competitive landscape. As competition continues to pressure rivals, time will tell whether agent-based workflows become a core component of economic activity. OpenAI and Anthropic are certainly banking on that. Daily Debrief Newsletter Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.cc:T4c3,The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility, with Bitcoin dropping below the critical $70,000 level for the first time in history. This decline is driven by risk-off sentiment in traditional markets, massive liquidations of leveraged positions, and macroeconomic uncertainties. Technical indicators suggest that if the market fails to stabilize, Bitcoin could see further corrections into the mid-$60,000s range.

Conversely, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has demonstrated relative resilience by maintaining its position above major structural support zones. Unlike Bitcoin, SHIB had already undergone prolonged selling pressure, which reduced speculative leverage and prevented a more severe breakdown. However, analysts warn that this strength does not guarantee a recovery, as overhead resistance remains high and Bitcoin's weakness could still drag altcoins down.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test as it approaches the psychologically significant $2,000 support level. After breaking below key moving averages, ETH remains under pressure from a negative market mood. The ability of buyers to defend the $2,000 threshold will be pivotal in determining the asset's medium-term direction.cd:Tb6a,ตลาด cryptocurrency กำลังเผชิญกับความผันผวนอย่างมาก โดย Bitcoin ร่วงหล่นลงต่ำกว่าระดับสำคัญ $70,000 ซึ่งเป็นครั้งแรกในประวัติศาสตร์ การดิ่งลงนี้เกิดจากความรู้สึกหลีกเลี่ยงความเสี่ยงในตลาดทั่วไป, การ liquidation ของเงินทุนเลเวอเรจจำนวนมาก และความไม่แน่นอนทางเศรษฐกิจ ตัวชี้วัดทางเทคนิคบ่งชี้ว่าหากตลาดไม่สามารถฟื้นตัวได้ Bitcoin อาจปรับตัวลงไปที่ระดับกลาง $60,000s ได้

The crypto industry has been severely impacted by recent market volatility, with Bitcoin experiencing a precipitous drop that sent the asset below significant historical levels that had held steady since its last significant breakout. As Bitcoin slipped through areas that many traders thought would provide long-term structural support to the so-called digital gold, the decline rocked market confidence. Shiba Inu avoids it On the other hand, Shiba Inu has shown a fair amount of resilience over the same time frame. While SHIB continues to trade within a broader downtrend, its price action has not mirrored Bitcoin’s collapse into historically critical territory. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView Rather than experiencing the kind of breakdown that drove Bitcoin below levels not broken since its previous bull cycle expansion, SHIB has been able to maintain its position above its most important structural support zones. HOT Stories Comparing the behavior of structural charts with percentage drawdowns makes this relative strength more evident. Although significant, SHIB's decline stayed within previously defined market ranges, while Bitcoin's decline erased months of consolidation gains and led to significant liquidation events. In other words, rather than going into a new stage of historical breakdown, SHIB stayed within anticipated corrective boundaries. A portion of this resilience stems from the fact that SHIB had previously been subjected to prolonged selling pressure, which had essentially compressed a large portion of the speculative premium prior to the most recent market-wide correction. Consequently, there was less excess leverage and speculative positioning to unwind than with Bitcoin, which had experienced a more vigorous rally before the decline. Investors should not, however, confuse relative strength with a proven recovery. SHIB continues to encounter strong overhead resistance, and the mood of the market as a whole is still shaky. Short-term pressure on altcoins, including SHIB, could still result from any new weakness in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's historic plunge The decline in Bitcoin is being caused by a number of fundamental factors. First, there is a significant decline in the appetite for macro risk, as evidenced by the sell-off of tech and equity stocks, along with digital assets. Risk-off sentiment in stocks has resulted in pressure on Bitcoin and other significant tokens, renouncing the crypto market's separation from traditional financial markets. Secondly, the sell-off has been made worse by leveraged positions and cryptocurrency liquidations. Numerous long positions were compelled to liquidate as the price broke crucial support levels, causing cascades that accelerated the momentum of the decline. According to derivatives data, there have been billions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency liquidations in the past week, further undermining market confidence. You Might Also Like Third, speculation has been impacted by expectations of monetary tightening and macroeconomic policy uncertainty. When investors reevaluate risk exposure in the face of tightening liquidity conditions, the U.S. dollar's strength and the nomination of a hawkish Federal Reserve chair have diminished the allure of high-beta assets like Bitcoin. The technical state is also important. Now that the price has moved into a weaker support zone with little historical buy interest, Bitcoin may be tested further at lower levels if the current ranges do not hold. Going forward, it will be critical if Bitcoin can recover $70,000 and stay above it. Deeper corrections, perhaps in the mid-$60,000s or lower, could occur if this market fails to stabilize, particularly if macro headwinds and capital flight from risky assets continue. Ethereum under pressure As the asset quickly approaches the structurally and psychologically significant $2,000 support zone, Ethereum is currently experiencing one of its most crucial technical moments in recent months. ETH has broken below several support levels and important moving averages following weeks of persistent selling pressure, indicating that bears are still in control of the market. You Might Also Like Price action clearly demonstrates that the downward trend that started when Ethereum was unable to sustain its strength above the $3,000 region earlier in the cycle has continued. There has been a series of lower highs and lower lows as a result of renewed selling following each recovery attempt. The recent collapse below intermediate support zones sped up the decline, bringing ETH perilously near levels that could dictate the direction of the market in the medium term. Whether $2,000 can serve as a defensive line for buyers is currently the key question. This level that served as a pivot point during earlier market phases has both psychological significance and historical significance. Given that daily momentum indicators are approaching oversold territory, Ethereum may experience at least a brief stabilization or relief bounce if buyers are able to intervene forcefully. However, there is still a high risk. The overall mood of the cryptocurrency market is still negative; altcoins are still under pressure from Bitcoin's decline, and capital flows continue to favor risk reduction over accumulation. In the absence of a significant surge in demand or a more extensive market recovery, ETH might find it difficult to stay afloat. Deeper support levels in the mid-$1,800s or even lower zones could be reached if there is a clear breakdown below $2,000, which would probably lead to additional liquidations. However, if Ethereum is able to hold this level and recover resistance regions above $2,400-$2,500, market confidence may eventually rebound.cf:T1263,Arthur Hayes sent roughly 3.63 million ENA, valued near $487K, to Galaxy and Binance, pulling market attention toward centralized liquidity dynamics. This transfer introduced tradable supply at a time when ENA already traded under pressure, therefore forcing participants to reassess intent. Large transfers often spark distribution fears; however, in this case….context matters. The move coincided with steady spot demand rather than panic selling. Traders continue to interact aggressively on the bid, which changes how this inflow reads. Instead of signaling urgency to exit, the timing aligns with controlled liquidity rotation. The surrounding order-flow behavior now carries greater weight, especially as Ethena [ENA] price hovers near a structurally important zone. ENA coils inside descending regression channel At press time, ENA traded inside a well-defined descending regression channel on the 4-hour chart, with price compressing near the lower boundary around $0.132–$0.130. Sellers continue to defend the channel midline, therefore limiting upside follow-through after each bounce. However, downside progress was noticeably slow as price respects horizontal demand near $0.130. This behavior shows sellers losing urgency rather than buyers chasing aggressively. The structure still leans bearish, yet momentum weakens with each push lower. Besides, repeated defenses of the channel base reduce liquidation efficiency for shorts. As a result, price compression increased tension within the range. While the broader trend remained corrective, the market waited for a catalyst. Either supply overwhelms demand decisively, or absorption forces a structural reaction toward the channel midpoint. The MACD remains below zero, yet the histogram contracts near -0.003, signaling fading downside momentum. Sellers still control trend direction, however their push lacks acceleration. Momentum oscillations flatten instead of expanding, which often precedes consolidation rather than continuation. Source: TradingView Buyers keep absorbing despite exchange inflows Spot Taker CVD over the 90-day window stayed firmly buyer-dominant, showing aggressive market buys outweighing sells even after ENA reached exchanges. Buyers actively lift offers instead of waiting passively, therefore absorbing new supply efficiently. This behavior contradicts panic distribution narratives. If sellers controlled the flow, taker sells would expand sharply. Instead, bids remain persistent. Additionally, CVD fails to roll over during price weakness, reinforcing absorption rather than capitulation. This dynamic suggests larger players defend inventory zones rather than exit hastily. Consequently, Hayes’ transfer interacts with demand instead of overwhelming it. Sustained absorption often builds pressure beneath resistance, especially inside compressed structures. Therefore, order flow currently favors balance rather than breakdown, keeping rebound scenarios technically viable. Source: CryptoQuant Short liquidations stack above price The Liquidation Map revealed dense short-side leverage between $0.135 and $0.145, with cumulative exposure exceeding $3 million above spot. Below the price, liquidation density thins considerably. This imbalance creates asymmetric risk. If price grinds higher, forced buy-ins could accelerate movement quickly. However, shorts remain comfortable while the price stays capped. Each failed bounce encourages additional short positioning, therefore increasing vulnerability. Importantly, leverage clusters concentrate around the regression midline. A reclaim would not need explosive volume to trigger reactions. Even modest continuation could pressure overexposed shorts. As a result, downside follow-through offers diminishing returns, while upside reactions carry convex risk. The liquidation structure now amplifies the importance of absorption and stabilization signals. Source: CoinGlass To sum up, Arthur Hayes’ ENA transfer does not resemble aggressive distribution. Buyer-dominant Spot Taker CVD, slowing downside momentum, and heavy short-side leverage suggest the market continues to absorb supply efficiently. While ENA remains structurally constrained inside a descending channel, sellers no longer press with conviction. If absorption persists and price holds the lower boundary, ENA could stabilize and attempt a rebound rather than extend its decline, despite the added exchange liquidity. Final Thoughts The movement of 3.63 million ENA into Galaxy and Binance shifted attention to centralized liquidity, but market reactions stayed measured. Ethena continues to trade inside a descending regression channel, holding near the lower boundary around $0.130.d0:T4ff,Shares tumble below $200 in after-hours trading after Amazon unveils aggressive AI investment plan despite strong Q4 results. Amazon said Thursday it plans to spend $200 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, with a focus on artificial intelligence infrastructure, triggering a steep sell-off in after-hours trading. The stock dropped over 10% and fell below $200 as investors reacted to the scale of the planned investment. The announcement followed solid fourth-quarter earnings , with revenue climbing to $213.4 billion and net profit hitting $21.2 billion, matching analyst expectations. Amazon cited a strong holiday season and 24% year-over-year growth in its AWS cloud business as key drivers. The company also said it will close underperforming units to streamline operations. The layoffs, totaling 16,000 workers, announced last week, are part of these broader cost-cutting efforts. For the first quarter of 2026, Amazon forecast revenue between $173.5 billion and $178.5 billion, with operating income expected between $16.5 billion and $21.5 billion. Despite the strong cloud performance, AWS generated $35.6 billion in Q4 revenue, investors focused on the spending outlook. The sell-off comes amid broader tech sector concerns over ballooning AI-related investment.d1:Ta83,Bitcoin is down more than 40% from its October highs, but investors in spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled 6.6% of assets. Feb 5, 2026, 11:39 p.m. Latest developments: ETF investors are proving more resilient than many expected during bitcoin’s latest drawdown. In an interview on CoinDesk’s Markets Outlook, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted several key data points demonstrating this stability: Bitcoin has fallen more than 40% from recent highs, a move that historically rattles retail-heavy crypto markets. Over the same period, only 6.6% of Bitcoin ETF assets have exited. “For now, the ETF boomers have really come through,” he said. Why ETF holders are holding: Balchunas argues ETF investors are structurally different from crypto-native traders. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Many ETF buyers treat bitcoin as a 1%–2% “hot sauce” allocation alongside stocks and bonds, rather than a core holding. Their broader portfolios have benefited from strong equity markets, cushioning the psychological blow of crypto losses. ETF investors “tend to hold really strong,” Balchunas said, having lived through multiple market cycles in traditional assets. The contrast with crypto natives: The same price drop can feel radically different depending on exposure. Investors heavily concentrated in bitcoin face what Balchunas described as “existential crisis mode.” Leveraged traders and long-time holders may be driving more of the selling pressure than ETF investors. “Volatility is the cost of the returns,” Balchunas said, noting bitcoin has endured seven or eight similar drawdowns historically. Lessons from gold ETFs: Balchunas sees parallels between bitcoin and gold as ETF-wrapped assets. Gold ETFs suffered a roughly 40% drop over six months about a decade ago, during which about one-third of assets left. Despite that, gold ETFs later rebuilt assets and now hold roughly $160 billion. Bitcoin ETFs briefly rivaled gold ETFs in size before the recent selloff, highlighting how flows can reverse over time. What comes next: Volatility is likely to persist, but ETFs may anchor bitcoin’s place in traditional finance. Balchunas said bitcoin’s 17-year history shows repeated recoveries to new highs after major downturns. ETF structures mean Bitcoin now sits alongside stocks, bonds and commodities in mainstream portfolios. “A selloff doesn’t mean the end,” he said. “It just means it’s a selloff.” AI Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards .

Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached a peak high of $126,000 in early October, but tumbled over the quarter ending Dec. 31 to under $88,500. Bitcoin is down 30% so far this year to $64,500, below Strategy’s average cost per BTC of $76,052. Strategy (MSTR) said on Thursday that, despite the loss, its Q4 revenues rose 1.9% year-on-year to $123 million, driven in part by its business intelligence arm. However, the recent Bitcoin sell-off saw its shares close 17% lower on Thursday to $107. Shares in Strategy tumbled on Thursday alongside Bitcoin. Source: Google Finance Bitcoin’s latest tumble pushed it to a low of $62,500 on Thursday, leaving Strategy down 17.5% on its 713,502 Bitcoin holdings. Strategy on strong financial footing, says finance boss Despite the massive quarterly loss, Strategy chief financial officer Andrew Kang said in a statement that the company’s capital structure remains “stronger and more resilient today than ever before.” “Strategy has built a digital fortress anchored by 713,502 Bitcoins and our shift to Digital Credit, which aligns with our indefinite Bitcoin horizon.” Related: US won't 'bail out' Bitcoin, says Treasury Secretary Bessent The company boosted its cash holdings to $2.25 billion in Q4, covering 30 months of dividend payouts, signaling financial strength despite the market downturn. Strategy also has no major debt maturing until 2027, meaning it isn’t under immediate pressure to repay borrowings and may not be forced to liquidate Bitcoin to meet obligations in the near term. Strategy CEO Phong Le told investors on an earnings call that there’s no reason to panic about the company’s financial position and its Bitcoin strategy. “I’m not worried, we’re not worried, and no, we’re not having issues.” He noted that Strategy’s enterprise value is still above its $45 billion Bitcoin reserve and that its $8.2 billion of convertible deb t only represents about 13% net leverage, below most Standard & Poor’s 500 companies.

Tether, the stablecoin issuer, has acquired a 12% ownership position in Gold.com for $150 million, deepening its expansion into the tokenized gold ecosystem. The investment establishes a long-term partnership to integrate XAU₮, Tether’s gold-backed digital asset, into Gold.com’s distribution channels and explore new on-ramps connecting physical gold and digital currencies. The announcement comes as gold recently surged to a record high above $5,500 per ounce in late January before retracing roughly 15%, trading around $4,700 at press time. The gold-backed stablecoin market has tripled over the past year to $5.5 billion, with XAU₮ now holding over 60% market share and $2.4 billion in circulation, overtaking PAXG for the top spot in the category. According to Tether, XAU₮ is fully backed by allocated physical gold held in secure vaults, with daily attestations and issuance under El Salvador’s Digital Asset Issuance Law. Each token represents one fine troy ounce linked to a London Good Delivery bar, with backing totaling roughly 140 tonnes of gold. CEO Paolo Ardoino emphasized that the move reflects long-term strategy, not speculation. “Gold exposure is not a trade for Tether; it is a hedge and a long-term allocation to protect our user base and ourselves in a world that is becoming increasingly unstable,” he said. “XAU₮ was built with that principle in mind, combining the resilience of gold with the efficiency of blockchain-based settlement.” The partnership also signals Tether’s push to bridge crypto-native and traditional finance, offering access to gold in real-world retail and institutional contexts. The firms are exploring the use of USD₮ and USA₮, Tether’s flagship and newly regulated dollar-backed stablecoins, for gold purchases.d4:Tace,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 Crypto market sentiment has slipped decisively into extreme fear, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index falling to 11 , one of its lowest readings since late 2023. The sharp deterioration reflects a combination of sustained price weakness, rising volatility, and persistent capital outflows, reinforcing a risk-off mood across the market. Historically, sub-20 index readings have coincided with periods of heightened stress, forced selling, and broad de-risking. Source: CoinMarketCap While such levels have sometimes preceded medium-term market bottoms, they more immediately signal caution as participants retreat to the sidelines. ETF outflows reinforce risk-off conditions Adding to the pressure on crypto market sentiment, U.S.-listed crypto ETFs recorded heavy net outflows on 4 February . Bitcoin ETFs saw net withdrawals of approximately $545m . In comparison, Ethereum ETFs posted outflows of around $79m , extending a trend of negative flows observed through late January. Source: CoinMarketCap The scale of the Bitcoin ETF outflows is particularly notable, given that spot ETFs had previously acted as a stabilising force during earlier drawdowns. Instead, the latest data suggests institutional positioning has turned defensive, with investors reducing exposure rather than absorbing spot market selling. Price weakness and volume fail to inspire confidence Despite intermittent relief rallies, Bitcoin’s price action remains under pressure, and trading volumes have risen during downswings rather than rebounds. This divergence typically reflects distribution rather than accumulation, reinforcing the fragile sentiment backdrop captured by the fear index. Ethereum has mirrored this weakness, with ETF flows and price action pointing to broad-based caution rather than asset-specific concerns. Altcoins, meanwhile, have underperformed relative to the broader market, amplifying perceptions of systemic risk. What extreme fear signals for the market While extreme fear often attracts contrarian interest, current conditions suggest investors are prioritizing capital preservation over opportunistic positioning. The combination of negative ETF flows, elevated volatility, and weak price structure indicates that confidence has yet to stabilize. For sentiment to recover meaningfully, markets may require either a slowdown in ETF outflows, evidence of sustained spot demand, or a reduction in macro-driven uncertainty. Until then, the extreme fear reading underscores a market still searching for a firm footing. Final Thoughts Sentiment has collapsed to extreme fear, reflecting persistent selling pressure and fragile confidence. ETF outflows remain a key overhang, signalling continued institutional risk aversion.d5:T513,Stock tumbles 17% on Thursday as crypto drawdown triggers $7.5B paper loss on BTC holdings as Bitcoin drops to $64K. Strategy reported a $12.4 billion net loss for the fourth quarter of 2025 as it announced its financial results Thursday, with Bitcoin falling to $64,000 amid a sharp crypto market downturn. The report follows one of Bitcoin’s worst trading days since the October 2025 flash crash, with the asset falling more than 12% on the day. The drawdown puts Strategy’s 713,502 BTC holdings deep underwater, translating to a $7.5 billion paper loss based on the company’s disclosed $76,052 average cost per coin. The selloff hammered Strategy’s stock price, which fell 17% to $106, erasing year-to-date gains and bringing it near levels last seen in August 2024. Despite the volatility, Strategy emphasized its long-term commitment to Bitcoin-backed credit. “We raised $25.3 billion of capital in 2025 to advance our Bitcoin treasury strategy,” said CEO Phong Le, adding that 41,002 BTC were acquired in January 2026 alone. The company’s USD Reserve now stands at $2.25 billion, providing more than 2.5 years of dividend and debt coverage. Its STRC credit product has reached $3.4 billion in issuance with an adjustable 11.25% dividend rate designed to maintain price stability.d6:T15f4,In brief Waymo told senators that human operators overseas provide guidance to its vehicles in difficult situations but do not control driving. Sen. Ed Markey said overseas involvement raises safety, cybersecurity, and accountability concerns. Waymo defended the practice as limited contextual assistance as Congress weighs new federal AV rules. Waymo’s claim that its vehicles operate without human drivers drew sharp scrutiny on Wednesday after a senior executive acknowledged that overseas operators help guide the company’s autonomous cars through difficult situations on U.S. streets, raising new questions about what “ self-driving ” really means. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Waymo Chief Safety Officer Mauricio Peña confirmed that the company relies on remote human operators to assist vehicles when they encounter scenarios they cannot independently resolve. “They provide guidance, they do not remotely drive the vehicles,” Peña told lawmakers. “Waymo asks for guidance in certain situations and gets an input, but the Waymo vehicle is always in charge of the dynamic driving task.” The answer did not satisfy Senator Edward Markey (D., Mass.), who asked whether all of the remote operators were based in the U.S. Peña said they were not, later identifying the overseas location as the Philippines. Markey warned that overseas human involvement undermines public claims of full autonomy while introducing safety and cybersecurity risks. “Having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue,” Markey said. “The information the operators receive could be outdated. It could introduce tremendous cybersecurity vulnerabilities.” Lawmakers also questioned whether remote operators abroad are subject to U.S. licensing or regulatory standards, and criticized Waymo for outsourcing what he described as one of the few remaining human jobs in an increasingly automated system. National framework The Senate hearing comes as Congress weighs whether to include a national autonomous-vehicle framework in the next surface transportation reauthorization bill, and as Waymo faces additional scrutiny following its attempts to scale its business into new markets. On Monday, the robo taxi company announced a $16 billion funding round, bringing the valuation of the company to $126 billion. In an interview with Decrypt , a Waymo spokesperson clarified that the company does not consider its remote operators to be drivers and rejected the idea that humans are controlling vehicles in real time. “Their role is not to drive the vehicle remotely. They’re not remote drivers,” the spokesperson said. “They answer, generally speaking, multiple-choice questions posed to them by the vehicle.” “All of the driving actually happens on board of that vehicle. It doesn’t happen remotely,” they added. The spokesperson said both U.S.-based and overseas fleet response agents are licensed drivers and receive training on local road rules in the regions they support. “All fleet response agents, both those based in the U.S. and those based abroad, have vehicle or van driver’s licenses,” the spokesperson said. “They learn about local road rules where they will be providing remote assistance.” Waymo characterized the human input as contextual rather than directive. “The human offers a suggestion in a challenging scenario, and the Waymo Driver will take that suggestion into account when making its next decision,” the spokesperson said. Some safety researchers said remote human involvement can still play a decisive role when things go wrong. Philip Koopman, a professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous-vehicle safety, pointed to past crashes in which remote assistance contributed to errors. “Even though Waymo says these remote assistants aren’t actually steering or braking, their helping out can substantially contribute to a crash, and, in my mind, that makes them a backup driver,” Koopman told Decrypt. William Riggs, a professor at the University of San Francisco who studies autonomous-vehicle policy and deployment, said the use of off-site human support is consistent with how autonomous systems are designed and regulated today. “It is also important to distinguish between 'remote human assistance' and 'remote driving,' as these terms are often conflated,” Riggs told Decrypt. “Remote driving involves directly controlling a vehicle from a distance, whereas remote supervision—used by companies developing true Level 4 autonomy—enables vehicles to make on-board decisions independently, with remote supervisors acting as a support layer rather than direct operators.” “The vehicles still operate within their agreed-upon and permitted Operational Design Domains (ODDs),” he added. “These ODDs are carefully defined in collaboration with state regulators and adhere to evolving legal frameworks around driving rules.” The hearing comes as U.S. states continue to issue regulations governing autonomous vehicles and as Congress weighs whether to pass a federal law overseeing the technology. Waymo and other companies, including Tesla, which also testified during the hearing, face heightened scrutiny over their self-driving capabilities. Editor's note: This headline has been adjusted to more fairly reflect Waymo's testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

This sharp decline has pushed most public crypto companies below their average cost basis, leaving balance sheets weakened and preventing efficient capital raising due to collapsed equity premiums. The market is now pricing survival risk rather than rewarding accumulation, as evidenced by many firms trading below a market net asset value (mNAV) of 1.

While immediate bankruptcy is not widespread, the risk is rising for leveraged firms and miners facing liquidity crunches. Unrealized losses do not directly cause insolvency, but when combined with debt and falling asset prices, they create a dangerous feedback loop. Major holders like MicroStrategy are even trading at a discount to their Bitcoin holdings, limiting their financial flexibility. The sector remains solvent for now but is navigating a deleveraging phase with a significantly reduced margin for error.d8:Tb5b,คลังสินทรัพย์ Crypto กำลังเผชิญกับความเครียดทางการเงินอย่างหนักหลังจากราคา Bitcoin และ Ethereum ดิ่งลงเกือบ 30% ไล่ล้างมูลค่าที่ยังไม่เกิดผลไปประมาณ 25 พันล้านดอลลาร์ การดิ่งลงครั้งนี้ทำให้บริษัท crypto สาธารณะส่วนใหญ่ถือครองสินทรัพย์ต่ำกว่าต้นทุนเฉลี่ย ส่งผลให้งบดุลอ่อนแอและขัดขวางการระดมทุนเนื่องจากค่าพรีเมียมหุ้นถดถอยลง ตลาดจึงเริ่มประเมินความเสี่ยงในการดำรงอยู่มากกว่าผลตอบแทนจากการสะสมสินทรัพย์ ซึ่งเห็นได้จากหลายบริษัทที่มีมูลค่าตลาดต่ำกว่ามูลค่าสุทธิของสินทรัพย์ (mNAV) อยู่ที่ต่ำกว่า 1

Equity premiums collapsed, restricting funding options and raising dilution risk. Bankruptcy risk is rising for leveraged firms, but remains selective rather than widespread. Crypto treasury companies are under growing financial stress after Bitcoin and Ethereum fell nearly 30% in a week, wiping out an estimated $25 billion in unrealized value across digital asset balance sheets. Data tracking public crypto treasury firms shows that none currently hold assets above their average cost basis. The sharp drawdown has pushed most treasury strategies into loss territory at the same time, raising concerns about liquidity, financing, and long-term viability. Unrealized Profit and Loss of Digital Asset Treasuries. Source: Artemis Sponsored Losses Spread Across the Entire Digital Asset Treasury Sector The sell-off hit treasury-heavy firms simultaneously. Large holders recorded the deepest paper losses , dragging cumulative unrealized P&L sharply negative. The losses are unrealized, but the scale matters because it weakens balance sheets and equity valuations. As a result, the market has shifted from rewarding crypto accumulation to pricing survival risk. Sponsored Market Premiums Have Collapsed A key stress signal is the collapse in market net asset value (mNAV), which compares a company’s equity valuation to the value of its crypto holdings. Several major treasury firms now trade below an mNAV of 1 , meaning the market values their equity at a discount to the assets they hold. This eliminates the ability to raise capital efficiently through equity issuance without dilution. mNAV Falls Below 1 For Most Crypto Treasuries. Source: CoinGecko MicroStrategy, one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders , trades below its asset value despite holding tens of billions of dollars in crypto. That discount limits its flexibility to fund further purchases or refinance cheaply. Sponsored MicroStrategy Shares Lost 35% in a Month. Source: Google Finance Liquidity Drives Bankruptcy Risk Unrealized losses alone do not cause bankruptcy. The risk rises when falling asset prices collide with leverage, debt maturities, or ongoing cash burn. Mining firms and treasury vehicles that rely on external financing face the highest exposure. If crypto prices remain depressed, lenders may tighten terms, equity markets may stay closed, and refinancing options could narrow. Sponsored This creates a feedback loop. Lower prices reduce equity value, which limits capital access and increases pressure on balance sheets. A Stress Phase, Not a Collapse The current drawdown reflects forced deleveraging and tighter financial conditions rather than a failure of crypto assets themselves. However, if prices fail to recover and capital markets remain restrictive, stress could intensify. For now, crypto treasury firms remain solvent. But the margin for error has narrowed sharply.

From the 9th of February, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will support Futures products for these altcoins, opening a new venue for big players to gain exposure. As with past crypto offerings, there will be both large and micro-sized contracts. For ADA, the bigger size contract will contain 100K ADA coins, while the smaller one will have 10K ADA. Source: CME Chainlink’s contracts will contain 5K Chainlink [LINK] and 250 LINK coins for the larger and micro offerings, respectively. Finally, Stellar’s larger contract will have 250K Stellar [XLM] , and the smaller version will have 12,500 XLM. The latest addition will expand CME’s crypto portfolio to seven assets, covering Bitcoin, Ethereum [ETH] , Solana, and Ripple [XRP]. According to Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group global head of crypto products, the latest additions will offer investors more tools to gain exposure in the growing markets. He added, “Market participants will now have greater choice with enhanced flexibility and more capital efficiencies.” For his part, Martin Franchi, CEO of NinjaTrader, billed the move as a ‘watershed moment for the futures industry’ and underscored the growing appetite for the new asset class. “Digital assets are reaching a global inflection point as they become increasingly mainstream and more deeply integrated into investors’ portfolios.” Worth pointing out, however, these are structural developments and hardly viewed as bullish updates. For example, when Solana’s CME Futures debuted on the 17th of March 2025, it did $12 million in notional volume. But the price remained sideways below $130 amid broader weak sentiment. Similarly, the XRP CME Futures launch on the 19th May 2025 saw $19 million in notional volume, but the altcoin’s price dipped afterward. As such, similar muted market reactions may play out for Cardano [ADA] , LINK, or XLM, especially if the current risk-off environment extends to the launch date. What’s next for ADA and LINK? Meanwhile, whales were jumping on ADA as the price slipped lower to $0.2. Whale wallets holding 1 million to 10 million ADA, and those holding 100 million ADA, have been adding positions over the past few weeks. Source: Santiment LINK also showed structural strength, with overall selling pressure, as indicated by Supply on Exchanges, remaining relatively low around 119 million LINK. This was comparable to selling pressure in late 2025, signalling a measured dump. Source: Santiment If the altcoin season momentum flips back to positive, the fundamentals could lift LINK and ADA. That said, ADA was down 8.5% in the past 24 hours while LINK traded at $9 after shedding 8%. XLM also posted 8% loss as the crypto rout deepened. Final Thoughts CME Futures’ expansion to ADA, LINK, and XLM underscored deepening institutional exposure to altcoins. However, the February 9 launch may be met with less market optimism amid a broader risk-off environment.db:T45c,Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies highlights that Bitcoin has entered a bearish reversal phase, signaled by a breakdown below the Ichimoku cloud, marking a significant shift from its previous uptrend. Despite the current extreme bearish sentiment and high volatility driven by thin liquidity, these conditions often coincide with market lows, suggesting that downside risk is being assessed rather than implying a guaranteed bounce. Stockton notes that while stochastic indicators may take months to recover from oversold territory, volatility itself presents trading opportunities for those navigating the market carefully.

Looking ahead, Stockton maintains a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum, predicting it will eventually outperform Bitcoin despite the latter's temporary stability in a risk-off environment. She emphasizes that technical analysis remains highly effective in the crypto space due to global liquidity and trading patterns. Furthermore, she suggests that Bitcoin’s current basing phase could preserve the potential for a secular bull trend to resurface once market conditions stabilize.dc:T225c,Bitcoin's bearish reversal hints at a potential market low amid rising volatility and shifting sentiment. Key Takeaways Technical analysis is particularly effective in crypto markets due to their global trading and liquidity. The recent uptrend in Bitcoin has reversed, indicating a significant change in market conditions. The Ichimoku model is used to gauge primary trends and potential support and resistance levels in price. Bitcoin has entered a bearish reversal phase as indicated by the breakdown below the Ichimoku cloud. Historically, when the stochastic oscillator reaches oversold territory, it can take months to recover. A combination of indicators is essential for making informed trading decisions in volatile markets. Current bearish sentiment in Bitcoin could indicate a potential low point for the market. Thin liquidity in crypto markets can lead to dramatic price movements. Bitcoin’s volatility has its own cycles influenced by macroeconomic conditions and political headlines. Ethereum is poised to outperform Bitcoin in the long term despite Bitcoin’s current stability. The market is likely to experience further downside volatility before bottoming out. Support levels serve as gauges of potential downside risk rather than acting as magnets for price. Cryptocurrencies are among the first assets to be penalized when market sentiment turns negative. Guest intro Katie Stockton, CMT, is Founder and Managing Partner of Fairlead Strategies, LLC, an independent research firm and registered investment advisor based in Greenwich, Connecticut, that specializes in technical analysis. She previously served as Chief Technical Strategist at BTIG and Chief Market Technician at MKM Partners. Katie is recognized as a CNBC Contributor for her coverage of US equities and bitcoin. Why technical analysis thrives in crypto markets “Cryptocurrencies have been lending themselves very well to technical analysis” – Katie Stockton Technical analysis is effective due to the global trading and liquidity of crypto markets. Support and resistance levels are key areas of buying and selling pressure on the charts. “The uptrend that we could draw back to the $20.22 low has certainly reversed itself” – Katie Stockton Reversal of Bitcoin’s uptrend indicates a significant change in market conditions. The Ichimoku model is popular internationally for gauging primary trends. “We saw the bottom boundary of the so-called cloud taken out” – Katie Stockton Breakdown below the Ichimoku cloud signals a bearish reversal in Bitcoin. Understanding the Ichimoku model and its implications The Ichimoku model helps gauge primary trends and potential support and resistance levels. “It’s derived from midpoints of price” – Katie Stockton Breakdown below the Ichimoku cloud indicates a bearish reversal in Bitcoin. “We saw that breakdown below the cloud” – Katie Stockton The model is popular internationally and provides a comprehensive view of market trends. Knowledge of the Ichimoku cloud is essential for understanding trend analysis. The model’s components are used to assess market conditions and predict price movements. “The Ichimoku model is designed to gauge the primary trend” – Katie Stockton Trading opportunities in a bearish market “It’s not to say that within that framework we won’t have opportunities to trade Bitcoin” – Katie Stockton Volatility in bear cycles can present trading opportunities. Counter-trend trading from a shorter-term perspective is possible. “There are still trading opportunities in Bitcoin even during a bear cycle” – Katie Stockton Awareness of market volatility is key to identifying trading opportunities. “Historically, when the stochastic oscillator reaches oversold territory, it can take months to recover” – Katie Stockton The stochastic oscillator’s oversold condition can indicate potential trading opportunities. “It took months and even at times more than just months to get out of that oversold condition” – Katie Stockton The role of sentiment and indicators in market predictions “The sentiment data is pretty extremely bearish” – Katie Stockton Bearish sentiment can indicate a potential low point for the market. Sentiment analysis influences market predictions and trading strategies. “That would be conducive to a low” – Katie Stockton A combination of indicators is essential for making informed trading decisions. “We use a combination of indicators” – Katie Stockton The weight of the evidence approach evaluates market conditions before adding exposure. “We don’t have the weight of the evidence right now to give us confidence to add exposure” – Katie Stockton Navigating market volatility with technical analysis “Thin liquidity in crypto markets can lead to dramatic price movements” – Katie Stockton Market conditions can influence price volatility, crucial for traders and investors. Support levels in crypto are not precise points but rather areas. “Support levels don’t act as magnets really” – Katie Stockton “They are more just gauges of potential downside risk” – Katie Stockton Understanding the dynamics of liquidity and price movements is essential. “A bounce could be very dramatic in the same way that the downdraft was dramatic” – Katie Stockton Market participant variability affects support levels in technical analysis. Long-term trends and the future of Ethereum “Bitcoin’s volatility has its own cycles” – Katie Stockton Bitcoin’s price movements and volatility are influenced by macroeconomic conditions. Ethereum is poised to outperform Bitcoin in the long term. “The longer-term trend does indeed favor ETH” – Katie Stockton Bitcoin’s current stability in a risk-off environment is temporary. “That to me in a way preserves the potential for the secular bull trend to resurface” – Katie Stockton Understanding the factors influencing Bitcoin’s price movements is crucial. “It has the ability to almost maybe move into a basing phase” – Katie Stockton The impact of sentiment on market stabilization “We may see some stabilization in the market due to extremely bearish sentiment readings” – Katie Stockton The fear and greed index reflects current market sentiment. “We certainly wouldn’t be surprised to see some stabilization” – Katie Stockton Extremely bearish sentiment can lead to market stabilization. “Looking at the Bitcoin fear and greed index” – Katie Stockton Sentiment analysis is crucial for investors seeking potential entry points. “Very extremely bearish sentiment reading” – Katie Stockton Understanding market sentiment is key to predicting potential price movements. Bitcoin’s role as a proxy for altcoin trading Altcoins generally follow Bitcoin’s price movements. “You can spend the most time understanding Bitcoin and that can inform your bias” – Katie Stockton Bitcoin is a useful proxy for trading smaller coins. Altcoins tend to bottom and top around the same time as Bitcoin. “They tend to bottom right around the same time and top right around the same time” – Katie Stockton Using Bitcoin as a top-down proxy for smaller coins is the best approach for now. “Using Bitcoin as sort of the top-down proxy for these smaller coins is the way to go” – Katie Stockton Understanding the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins is crucial for trading. The influence of technical indicators on trading strategies “Technical indicators can help navigate market sentiment” – Katie Stockton Indicators improve trading probabilities by assessing market conditions. “They will at least put more probabilities in our favor” – Katie Stockton Technical indicators are inherently lagging but help eliminate noise. “Most technical indicators are lagging” – Katie Stockton Understanding the role of technical indicators is crucial for trading strategies. “They can help us eliminate some of the noise” – Katie Stockton Indicators identify meaningful trends and improve trading decisions. The cyclical nature of markets and investment opportunities “The current market may be an off year for certain trends” – Katie Stockton Off years present potential buying opportunities in the future. “We can ultimately have a great buying opportunity to take advantage of” – Katie Stockton Understanding market cycles is crucial for strategic investments. “The pullbacks in silver and gold may indicate the start of a new cycle” – Katie Stockton Pullbacks can signal the beginning of new market cycles. “The pullbacks do look like the start of this kind of newer cycle” – Katie Stockton Recognizing market trends helps identify investment opportunities.dd:Tddd,In brief Major digital asset treasuries are massively down on their investments, according to data from Artemis. Leading firms Strategy and BitMine hold the biggest paper losses of $9.2 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. Even firms stacking Solana (SOL), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and BNB are posting sizable unrealized losses. Prominent digital asset treasuries (DATs), including Bitcoin behemoth Strategy (MSTR) and leading Ethereum firm BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), are now well down on their crypto investments, according to data gathered by blockchain analytics firm Artemis. The losses are growing among firms that are primarily focused on amassing cryptocurrency, with BMNR down around $8.4 billion on its Ethereum purchases as Strategy holds $9.2 billion in paper losses on its consistent Bitcoin buys. The unrealized losses have quickly multiplied on account of the top crypto assets slide in the last week. BTC, which is down 13% in the last 24 hours, has fallen 24% in the last seven days to change hands around $63,708. Meanwhile, Ethereum has fared even worse, dropping almost 34% in the last seven days and falling to its lowest mark since last May, recently changing hands around $1,867. The Artemis data does not include crypto-centric firms that have a primary business focus outside of buying and holding assets—such as exchange Coinbase and mining firm Riot Platforms—or companies with a core business outside of crypto that have amassed a position in digital assets (like Tesla and GameStop). Despite a major drop in prices for the asset, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor remains undeterred, recently telling followers on X that there are only two rules related to Bitcoin. “1. Buy Bitcoin. 2. Don’t sell Bitcoin,” he posted earlier this week . While selling Bitcoin would invalidate those rules, the firm’s chairman changed his tune near the end of last year as it relates to the practicalities of his BTC business, saying that he needed to “dispel the notion” that the firm “couldn't or wouldn't” sell BTC to fund its dividends product. With the losses mounting, predictors on Myriad’s prediction market believe it’s more likely that Strategy may sell some of its BTC holdings sometime this year. In the last week, odds of the firm selling any of its 713,502 BTC have jumped to around 32%. It’s not just the leading treasuries or those stacking BTC or ETH that are hurting, though. The Artemis dashboard accounts for more than $25 billion in losses, including around $1 billion in unrealized losses for Solana treasury firm Forward Industries and more than $100 million in paper losses for firms stacking Hyperliquid (HYPE) and BNB. The DAT unwind has led to scrutiny from traditional financial analysts, with Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg taking a shot at the premise on Thursday via an X post : "It's hard not to think that the explosion of DAT companies last year, where various crypto holders exchanged their tokens for inflated equity, was a big last gasp for this industry." Crypto-natives have been critical too, with some prodding Lee and Saylor on social media about their firms. Last year, interim CEO of Solana business and treasury firm SOL Strategies, Michael Hubbard, told Decrypt he believed there was “no sustainable market for digital asset treasuries,” adding that staking ETFs would ultimately “eat their lunch.” Daily Debrief Newsletter Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.de:T1176,Key takeawys: Bitcoin fell below $63,000 as weak US job data and concerns over AI industry investments fueled investor risk aversion. Options markets show a 6% chance of Bitcoin returning to $90,000 by March. Bitcoin ( BTC ) slid below $63,000 on Thursday, hitting its lowest level since November 2024. The 30% drop since the failed attempt to break $90,500 on Jan. 28 has left traders skeptical of any immediate bullish momentum. The current bearish sentiment is fueled by weak US job market data and rising concerns over massive capital expenditure within the artificial intelligence sector. Regardless of whether Bitcoin’s slump was triggered by macroeconomic shifts, options traders are now pricing in just 6% odds of BTC reclaiming $90,000 by March. Deribit March BTC options pricing on Thursday. Source: Deribit / Cointelegraph On Deribit exchange, the right to buy Bitcoin at $90,000 on March 27 (a call option) traded at $522 on Thursday. This pricing suggests investors see little chance of a massive rally. According to the Black-Scholes model, these options reflect less than 6% odds of Bitcoin reaching $90,000 by late March. For context, the right to sell Bitcoin at $50,000 (a put option) for the same date traded at $1,380, implying a 20% probability of a deeper crash. Quantum computing risks and forced liquidation fears drive Bitcoin selling Market participants have reduced crypto exposure due to emerging quantum computing risks and fears of forced liquidations by companies that built Bitcoin reserves through debt and equity. In mid-January, Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, removed a 10% Bitcoin allocation from his model portfolio, citing the risk of quantum computers reverse-engineering private keys. Bitcoin holdings from public companies, USD. Source: bitcontreasuries.net Strategy (MSTR US), the largest publicly listed company with onchain BTC reserves, recently saw its enterprise value dip to $53.3 billion, while its cost basis sat at $54.2 billion. Japan’s Metaplanet (MPJPY US) faced a similar gap, valued at $2.95 billion against a $3.78 billion acquisition cost. Investors are worried that a prolonged bear market might force these companies to sell their positions to cover debt obligations. External factors likely contributed to the rise in risk aversion, and even silver, the second-largest tradable asset by market capitalization, suffered a 36% weekly price drop after reaching a $121.70 all-time high on Jan. 29. Bitcoin/USD vs. Thomson Reuters, PayPal, Robinhood, Applovin and Silver/USD. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Bitcoin’s 27% weekly decline closely mirrors losses seen in several billion-dollar listed companies, including Thomson Reuters (TRI), PayPal (PYPL), Robinhood (HOOD) and Applovin (APP). US employers announced 108,435 layoffs in January, up 118% from the same period in 2025, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The surge marked the highest number of January layoffs since 2009, when the economy was nearing the end of its deepest downturn in 80 years. Related: Next Bitcoin accumulation phase may hinge on credit stress timing–Data Market sentiment had already weakened after Google (GOOG US) reported on Wednesday that capital expenditure in 2026 is expected to reach $180 billion, up from $91.5 billion in 2025. Shares of tech giant Qualcomm (QCOM US) fell 8% after the company issued weaker growth guidance, citing that supplier capacity has been redirected toward high-bandwidth memory for data centers. Traders expect investments in artificial intelligence to take longer to pay off due to rising competition and production bottlenecks, including energy constraints and shortages of memory chips. Bitcoin’s slide to $62,300 on Thursday reflects uncertainty around economic growth and US employment, making a rebound toward $90,000 in the near term increasingly unlikely.

The crypto industry has reportedly proposed sharing stablecoin reserves with community lenders as it steps up efforts to win over skeptical banks. The move aims to preserve the stalled crypto market structure bill that could significantly alter the financial system. Deposit Fears and the Search For Compromise A Bloomberg report revealed that crypto firms have spent weeks trying to win over doubtful banks by offering new concessions focused on stablecoins, which have become the central point of disagreement. According to sources cited in the report, the latest ideas include giving community banks a larger role in the stablecoin ecosystem. One proposal would require issuers to hold a portion of their reserves at these financial institutions. Another recommendation would make it easier for these firms to issue their own dollar-pegged digital assets. However, the two sides have not agreed on any resolution, and it remains unclear whether the proposals would go far enough to address fears of customers moving deposits out of the banking system. A separate report from analyst Geoff Kendrick had warned that stablecoins could lead to the exit of as much as $500 billion in bank deposits across industrialized nations by the end of 2028. This comes as the overall digitalized dollar market continues to experience notable growth, with the total supply in circulation having risen by roughly 40% over the past year. Digital Asset Firms Remain Divided On the other hand, not all crypto companies are aligned with the suggestions. One of the biggest points of contention is whether platforms like Coinbase should be allowed to pay users rewards for holding stablecoins. Traditional financial institutions also argue that these payouts could pull customers away from checking and savings accounts, which threatens a major source of deposits for them.

Despite the friction, the development is still being viewed as a positive sign that the market-structure bill will keep moving in Congress. This is after the legislation was passed by the House of Representatives last year, but has since slowed in the Senate due to unresolved disagreements between the two sectors. Meanwhile, in a recent interview with Fox News, Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, expressed his optimism about finding a compromise. “We can protect consumers and community banks while still allowing innovation and competition to lower prices and expand access,” the senator said. “Both sides are working toward a compromise that keeps innovation here in America.” SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer).

This rotation rather than exit strategy suggests ARK remains committed to the crypto sector but is adjusting its investments toward companies it believes have better growth potential during the current market weakness, which has seen Bitcoin drop toward $60,000 and exchange trading volumes slow significantly.","aiSummaryThai":"ARK Invest ภายใต้การนำของ Cathie Wood ได้ขายหุ้น Coinbase มูลค่าประมาณ 17 ล้านดอลลาร์ หลังจากที่ราคาหุ้นดิ่งลงกว่า 40% ในช่วงเดือนที่ผ่านมา นี่ถือเป็นการเปลี่ยนแปลงกลยุทธ์ที่สำคัญ เนื่องจาก ARK เคยซื้อหุ้น Coinbase มาตลอดเมื่อราคาตกต่ำก่อนหน้านี้ บริษัทได้โอนเงินเข้าไปลงทุนใน Bullish ซึ่งเป็นแพลตฟอร์มการซื้อขายสินทรัพย์ดิจิทัลสำหรับสถาบัน โดยซื้อหุ้นมูลค่าประมาณ 17.8 ล้านดอลลาร์ แม้ว่า Bullish เองก็กำลังดิ้นรน (ราคาหุ้นลดลง 60% ตั้งแต่เข้าตลาดและรายงานขาดทุนไตรมาสที่ 4 อย่างหนัก)\n\nแม้จะขายหุ้น Coinbase ไปบางส่วน แต่ ARK ยังคงถือหุ้น Coinbase ในมูลค่าประมาณ 312 ล้านดอลลาร์ในกองทุน ETF ของตน การหมุนเวียนการลงทุนแทนที่จะถอนตัวออกจากตลาดนี้ ชี้ให้เห็นว่า ARK ยังคงภักดีต่อภาคส่วน crypto แต่กำลังปรับการลงทุนไปยังบริษัทที่เชื่อว่ามีศักยภาพการเติบโตที่ดีกว่าในช่วงที่ตลาดอ่อนแอ ซึ่ง Bitcoin ได้ตกลงมาใกล้ระดับ 60,000 ดอลลาร์ และปริมาณการซื้อขายในตลาดลดลงอย่างมีนัยสำคัญ","keyPoints":["ARK Invest sold $17M in Coinbase stock after its 40%+ price drop","The firm bought $17.8M in Bullish stock despite its own struggles","ARK still maintains a large $312M position in Coinbase","This represents a strategy rotation rather than exit from crypto","The move comes as Bitcoin drops toward $60,000 and trading volumes slow"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":517,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T13:05:38.977Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T13:05:38.977Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T14:20:40.590Z","__v":0},{"_id":"6985e72251f3090f7cf86e2e","guid":"https://watcher.guru/news/?p=230949","slug":"dogecoin-dips-below-10-cents-buy-before-musks-moon-mission","title":"Dogecoin Dips Below 10 Cents: Buy Before Musk’s Moon Mission?","link":"https://watcher.guru/news/dogecoin-dips-below-10-cents-buy-before-musks-moon-mission","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:03:00.000Z","content":"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price has fallen below the 10-cent mark for the first time since September 2024.

Additionally, the sector faces pressure from high-profile exits and platform closures, including Nike selling RTFKT, and Nifty Gateway and Rodeo ceasing operations.","aiSummaryThai":"มูลค่าตลาดรวมของ NFT ได้ตกต่ำลงเหลือน้อยกว่า 1.5 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ซึ่งกลับไปอยู่ในระดับเดียวกับก่อนเกิดความฮือฮาในปี 2021 การถอยตัวครั้งนี้เกิดขึ้นพร้อมกับตลาด crypto ที่ซบเซาโดยรวม ขณะที่ราคา Bitcoin (BTC) และ Ethereum (ETH) ปรับตัวลงอย่างมาก ซึ่งส่งผลกระทบต่อปริมาณการซื้อขาย NFT บนเครือข่ายทั้งสอง\n\nการหดตัวของตลาดได้รับแรงกดดันจากความไม่สมดุลระหว่างอุปทานที่เพิ่มขึ้นกับความต้องการที่ลดลง แม้ว่าปริมาณ NFT ในตลาดจะเพิ่มขึ้น 25% ในปี 2025 แต่ยอดขายรวมลดลง 37% เมื่อเทียบเป็นรายปี นอกจากนี้ ภาคส่วนนี้ยังได้รับผลกระทบจากการถอนตัวของบริษัทใหญ่และการปิดตัวของแพลตฟอร์ม เช่น Nike ที่ขาย RTFKT, Nifty Gateway และ Rodeo ที่ประกาศยุติการดำเนินงาน","keyPoints":["NFT market cap drops below $1.5 billion, hitting early 2021 levels.","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices slid, contributing to the market downturn.","NFT supply rose 25% in 2025 while sales fell 37%, causing an oversupply issue.","Major entities like Nike (RTFKT), Nifty Gateway, and Rodeo are exiting the market."],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":438,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T13:05:35.972Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T13:05:35.974Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T14:20:35.605Z","__v":0},{"_id":"6985e84a51f3090f7cf87038","guid":"4e7da9bc-7ee5-4fed-a89f-747b826c9bbb","slug":"xrp-at-center-as-ripple-lays-out-institutional-defi-blueprint-for-xrpl","title":"XRP at center as Ripple lays out institutional DeFi blueprint for XRPL","link":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/ripple-lays-out-institutional-defi-blueprint-for-xrpl-with-xrp-at-center","pubDate":"2026-02-06T12:54:09.000Z","content":"Ripple and XRPL developers say recent mainnet upgrades and upcoming features position the XRP Ledger as a hub for regulated, real-world finance.","author":"Shaurya Malwa","enclosure":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f542c898be63947a6f84e0efbf5107286dec9a07-3840x2160.png?fm=jpg&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","source":"CoinDesk","sourceCategory":"general","category":"defi","categories":["defi","altcoins"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"XRP อยู่ในจุดสำคัญขณะที่ Ripple วางแผนธุรกิจ DeFi ระดับสถาบันสำหรับ XRPL","translatedContent":"Ripple และนักพัฒนา XRPL ระบุว่าการอัปเกรดเมนเน็ตล่าสุดและคุณสมบัติที่จะเกิดขึ้น ทำให้ XRP Ledger กลายเป็นศูนย์กลางสำหรับการเงินโลกแบบครบวงจรภายใต้การกำกับดูแล","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$23","aiSummary":"Ripple and XRPL developers are positioning the XRP Ledger as a hub for regulated, institutional DeFi by integrating compliance features directly into the protocol layer.

The memecoin's price trajectory is closely following Bitcoin (BTC), which has fallen to the $62,000 mark, with some analysts predicting BTC could drop further to $38,000.\n\nThe market-wide downturn is attributed to tighter Federal Reserve policies, a shrinking liquidity crisis, macroeconomic worries, and geopolitical tensions. While there's a slight market rebound, it remains uncertain if this signals a bottom. As a memecoin, SHIB carries higher risks and may take longer to recover than other cryptocurrencies.

Despite some investors buying the dip below $70, with over $7 billion worth of SOL flowing out of exchanges in a sign of spot accumulation, sellers remain in control.

shift in global commerce. This historic achievement underscores the bloc's growing influence as economic growth accelerates through strategic expansion and deeper trade integration among member states including Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and newer members like UAE, Ethiopia, Iran, and Egypt. The record-breaking trade figures reflect the unique economic complementarity and strategic integration between these nations. The economic dominance within BRICS is led by China, which accounts for approximately 64% of the bloc's overall exports, while India achieved total external trade of US$825.25 billion and Russia's trade with China exceeded US$200 billion for the third consecutive year.

Structural concerns include Bitcoin trading below its estimated electrical cost of $77k, making mining less profitable and increasing capitulation risks. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoin bear markets typically experience 70% drops from all-time highs, which would point to a potential bottom around $38k.

While there may be support levels that could trigger reversals, the current technical and on-chain indicators suggest further pain ahead for ZRO holders.","aiSummaryThai":"ZRO token ของ LayerZero ลดลง 10% ในรอบ 24 ชั่วโมงที่ผ่านมา ในช่วงที่ตลาด altcoin กำลังขาลงอย่างหนัก โดยสูญเสียมูลค่าไปถึง 15% ในรอบสัปดาห์ การวิเคราะห์ทางเทคนิคชี้ว่า ZRO ได้เบรกลงต่ำกว่าระดับ Fibonacci retracement ที่สำคัญ ซึ่งบ่งชี้ว่าอาจมีแนวโน้มลดลงต่อไป การลดลงของราคานี้ถูกเร่งให้รุนแรงขึ้นโดยการขายของ retail traders บน DEX platforms เช่น Uniswap โดยมีการสั่งซื้อขนาดเล็กระหว่าง $10-$100 อย่างหนัก\n\nข้อมูลพื้นฐานของเครือข่ายก็ไม่น่าไว้ใจเช่นกัน โดยจำนวน transactions ลดลงมากกว่า 70% ในเวลาเพียง 3 สัปดาห์ นักวิเคราะห์ตลาดอย่าง Benjamin Cowen คาดการณ์ว่าแนวโน้มการขาลงนี้อาจดำเนินต่อไปตลอดปี 2026 โดย Bitcoin จะลากตลาดใหญ่ลงไปด้วย แม้จะมีแนวรับที่อาจทำให้เกิดการกลับตัว แต่ตัวชี้วัดทางเทคนิคและ on-chain ในปัจจุบันชี้ว่า ZRO holders อาจเผชิญกับความเจ็บปวดเพิ่มเติมในอนาคต","fullContent":"$81","keyPoints":["ZRO dropped 10% in 24 hours and 15% weekly","Technical analysis shows bearish outlook with potential for further decline","Retail traders selling heavily on DEX platforms","Network activity declined by over 70% in three weeks","Analyst predicts bear market may continue through 2026"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":568,"slug":"zro-down-10-after-retail-sells-hard-but-are-more-losses-next"},{"_id":"69859dfa38f2116917c2894b","guid":"https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1428048","__v":0,"author":"Wayne Jones","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Santiment says extreme fear after Bitcoin's $60K drop helped trigger a rebound, with a potential push toward $70K.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T07:53:30.744Z","enclosure":"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitcoin_Fear.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T07:53:30.744Z","link":"https://cryptopotato.com/santiment-crowd-fear-triggers-bitcoin-bounce-70k-rally-in-focus/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T07:52:59.000Z","sentiment":"bullish","source":"CryptoPotato","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"Santiment ชี้ว่าความกลัวสุดขั้วหลังบิทคอยน์ร่วงถึง $60K ช่วยกระตุ้นการดีดตัวกลับ","title":"Santiment: Crowd Fear Triggers Bitcoin Bounce, $70K Rally in Focus","translatedContent":"Santiment ระบุว่าความกลัวในระดับสูงสุดหลังจาก Bitcoin ปรับตัวลงถึง 60,000 ดอลลาร์ ได้ช่วยกระตุ้นให้เกิดการดีดตัวกลับ โดยมีแนวโน้มที่จะขยับขึ้นสู่ 70,000 ดอลลาร์","translatedTitle":"Santiment: ความกลัวของมวลชนกระตุ้นการดีดตัวกลับของ Bitcoin มุ่งสู่การปรับตัวเพิ่มขึ้น 70,000 ดอลลาร์","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T14:20:38.342Z","aiSummary":"$82","aiSummaryThai":"$83","fullContent":"$84","keyPoints":["Bitcoin dropped to $60,000 before rebounding toward $65,000 after its largest daily drop of over $10,000","Extreme social media fear often precedes short-term price rebounds according to Santiment","Market divided on whether this is a temporary technical reaction or setup for a $70,000 recovery","$$2.2 billion in long liquidations occurred, with mixed signals from \"smart money\" shorts and whale longs","BTC down nearly 9% in 24 hours and over 21% for the week, with downturn developing faster than 2022 bear market"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":578,"slug":"santiment-crowd-fear-triggers-bitcoin-bounce-70k-rally-in-focus"},{"_id":"69859d4238f2116917c25c11","guid":"https://watcher.guru/news/?p=230922","__v":0,"author":"Paigambar Mohan Raj","categories":["altcoins"],"category":"altcoins","content":"Ripple’s XRP token fell to $1.22 earlier today, Feb. 6, 2026.

Multi-strategy hedge funds are engaging in aggressive selling to satisfy internal risk models, causing a capitulation in the market. With roughly one-third of Bitcoin ETF shares owned by institutional players and hedge funds comprising half of that portion, the 'fast money' deployed in delta-hedged or relative value trades is quickly exiting the market. Bitcoin's implied volatility spiking to 75% (its highest level since the 2024 ETF launch) has triggered this extreme forced selling, particularly as it now exceeds gold volatility. Despite the current downturn, Park maintains a bullish medium-term outlook, viewing this as a necessary process to clear out leverage and weak hands before a 'fast melt-up' occurs.","aiSummaryThai":"เจฟ พาร์ก ที่ปรึกษาจาก Bitwise อธิบายว่าการที่ Bitcoin และตลาดคริปโตฯ ร่วงลงอย่างหนักล่าสุดเป็นผลมาจากการบริหารความเสี่ยงของสถาบัน โดยเฉพาะเฮดจ์ฟันด์ที่ใช้กลยุทธ์หลายรูปแบบซึ่งกำลังขายในวงกว้างเพื่อให้สอดคล้องกับแบบจำลองความเสี่ยงภายใน ประมาณหนึ่งในสามของหุ้น Bitcoin ETF ถูกถือโดยนักลงทุนสถาบัน ซึ่งเฮดจ์ฟันด์ถือครองอยู่ประมาณครึ่งหนึ่ง และเงินทุนเหล่านี้เป็น 'fast money' ที่ลงทุนในการเทรดแบบ delta-hedged หรือ relative value มากกว่าการลงทุนระยะยาว ความผันผวนโดยนัยของ Bitcoin ที่พุ่งสูงถึง 75% (สูงสุดนับตั้งแต่การเปิดตัว ETF ในปี 2024) ได้กลายเป็นตัวเร่งสำคัญของการขายแบบบังคับ แม้จะมีสภาพตลาดที่ตกต่ำแต่พาร์กยังคงมองโลกในแง่ดีระยะกลางถึงยาว โดยมองว่าสถานการณ์ปัจจุบันเป็นกระบวนการที่จำเป็นเพื่อกำจัดเลเวอเรจและนักลงทุนที่อ่อนแอก่อนที่จะเกิด 'fast melt-up' ขึ้น","fullContent":"$86","keyPoints":["Institutional risk management and hedge funds caused the crypto crash","Bitcoin ETF institutional ownership is roughly one-third, with hedge funds comprising half","Bitcoin's implied volatility reached 75%, triggering forced selling","Bitcoin volatility now exceeds gold volatility for the first time","Park remains bullish medium-term, expecting a 'fast melt-up' after leverage clears"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":429,"slug":"bitwise-advisor-explains-enormous-crypto-crash"},{"_id":"6985990e38f2116917c1647d","guid":"d10ea856-adb2-49b9-b44d-9f16012f85b8","__v":0,"author":"Sam Reynolds","categories":["regulation"],"category":"regulation","content":"Bank says institutional de-risking continues, but resilient network activity and growing TradFi adoption could lift revenue-linked assets over time","createdAt":"2026-02-06T07:32:30.311Z","enclosure":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c11c9abe9010ceaa61014a311262a6d680871b7d-1920x1080.jpg?fm=jpg&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T07:32:30.312Z","link":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/jefferies-sees-few-signs-of-a-crypto-bottom-yet-flags-upside-for-tokens-with-fundamentals","pubDate":"2026-02-06T07:30:59.000Z","sentiment":"neutral","source":"CoinDesk","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"Jefferies มองว่าตลาดคริปโตยังไม่ถึงจุดต่ำสุด แต่มองโ","title":"Jefferies sees few signs of a crypto bottom yet flags upside for tokens with fundamentals","translatedContent":"ธนาคารกล่าวว่าสถาบันการเงินยังคงดำเนินการลดความเสี่ยงต่อไป แต่กิจกรรมเครือข่ายที่ยังคงมีความยืดหยุ่นและการนำ TradFi มาใช้ที่เพิ่มขึ้นอาจช่วยผลักดันสินทรัพย์ที่เชื่อมโยงกับรายได้ให้เพิ่มขึ้นในระยะยาว","translatedTitle":"Jefferies มองว่ายังมีสัญญาณน้อยที่ราคาคริปโตจะถึงจุดต่ำสุด แต่เน้นว่าโทเคนที่มีพื้นฐานทางการเงินที่ดีมีโอกาสขาขึ้น","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T14:20:35.385Z","aiSummary":"Jefferies reports that despite Bitcoin and Ethereum trading near historically attractive levels, the crypto market shows few signs of an imminent bottom.

Bitcoin trades near $64,800 (47% below its October 2025 peak), while Ether hovers around $1,900 (down nearly 60% from cycle highs).\n\nThe bank attributes the weakness to broader risk-off sentiment in global markets and rotation away from growth assets, with $2 billion in long liquidations amplifying volatility. Near-term headwinds include selling from large Bitcoin holders and spot ETF net outflows. However, Jefferies notes that smaller and mid-sized holders are maintaining positions, and trading volumes have stabilized.

The downturn was fueled by over $2.6 billion in liquidations, which forced more than 500,000 traders out of their positions, highlighting the severity of the leverage unwind.\n\nUnlike previous crashes driven by specific systemic shocks, this decline resulted from a technical breakdown and waning market confidence. Bitcoin decisively lost the critical $65,000–$62,000 support zone and dropped below key moving averages, triggering stop-loss cascades.

This sharp decline from 42 just a month ago came as bitcoin's recent drop below $60,000 triggered market-wide deleveraging and defensive positioning among traders. The index, which combines multiple indicators including volatility, momentum, and search trends, shows how quickly sentiment has shifted from caution to outright fear.\n\nWhile bitcoin's subsequent bounce toward $65,000 suggests some opportunistic buying at psychological levels, the broader market remains in defensive mode with a \"sell first, ask questions later\" approach. Historically, extreme fear readings have often coincided with market bottoms as leveraged positions get flushed out, but analysts note the index is better understood as a stress measure rather than a timing tool for predicting price movements.","aiSummaryThai":"ดัชนีความกลัวและความโลภในตลาดคริปโตร่วงลงถึง 9 จุด ซึ่งเป็นระดับ \"ความกลัวขั้วสุด\" ที่ไม่เคยเห็นมาตั้งแต่การล่มสลายของ FTX สะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความรู้สึกเชิงลบในตลาดที่เสื่อมถอยลงอย่างรวดเร็ว การร่วงหล่นนี้จากระดับ 42 เมื่อหนึ่งเดือนก่อน เกิดขึ้นหลังจากการที่ราคาบิตคอยน์ตกลงต่ำกว่า 60,000 ดอลลาร์ ทำให้เกิดการปรับลดตำแหน่งเงินทุนและการถือโพซิชันป้องกันความเสี่ยงในตลาดทั่วไป ดัชนีนี้ซึ่งรวมตัวชี้วัดหลายอย่างรวมถึงความผันผวน โมเมนตัม และแนวโน้มการค้นหา แสดงให้เห็นว่าความรู้สึกในตลาดเปลี่ยนจากความระมัดระวังเป็นความกลัวอย่างชัดเจนแค่ไหน\n\nแม้ว่าการดีดตัวกลับของบิตคอยน์สู่ระดับ 65,000 ดอลลาร์จะบ่งบอกถึงการซื้อในราคาต่ำที่ระดับทางจิตวิทยาบางส่วน แต่ตลาดโดยรวมยังคงอยู่ในโหมดป้องกันตัวด้วยแนวทาง \"ขายก่อนถามภายหลัง\" ในอดีต ระดับความกลัวขั้วสุดมักจะสอดคล้องกับจุดต่ำสุดของตลาด เนื่องจากโพซิชันที่ใช้เลเวอเรจจะถูกปรับออก แต่นักวิเคราะห์ชี้ให้เห็นว่าดัชนีนี้ควรเข้าใจเป็นตัววัดความเครียดมากกว่าเครื่องมือกำหนดเวลาสำหรับทำนายการเคลื่อนไหวของราคา","fullContent":"$b1","keyPoints":["The Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped to 9, reaching \"extreme fear\" levels not seen since the FTX collapse","Bitcoin's sharp fall below $60,000 triggered market-wide deleveraging and rapid sentiment deterioration","While extreme fear has historically coincided with market bottoms, the index is better viewed as a stress measure than a timing tool"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":321},{"_id":"69856e9c38f2116917b7a8db","guid":"https://beincrypto.com/?p=455799","__v":0,"author":"Aaryamann Shrivastava","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin (BTC) registered their largest single-day falls this year, bringing the latter to $64,500.

He compares the two assets to a mouse and an elephant, noting that gold's massive market cap makes short-term price divergence irrelevant to its long-term thesis. Bitcoin's recent underperformance is attributed more to position unwinds and a liquidity squeeze than to a collapse in its fundamental value as an inflation hedge. The October 10 deleveraging event further highlighted the divergence between Bitcoin, which is trading as collateral, and altcoins, which are trading as bets on exchange governance.

แม้ว่าตลาดจะมีความรู้สึกเชิงลบอย่างรุนแรงและความผันผวนสูงจากสภาพคล่องที่ต่ำ แต่สภาวะเหล่านี้มักเกิดขึ้นพร้อมกับจุดต่ำสุดของตลาด บ่งชี้ว่าระดับการสนับสนุนทำหน้าที่เป็นเกจวัดความเสี่ยงมากกว่าจะเป็นแม่เหล็กดึงดูดราคา อย่างไรก็ตาม ความผันผวนเหล่านี้ยังคงสร้างโอกาสในการเทรดสำหรับผู้ที่มีความระมัดระวัง\n\nในมุมมองระยะยาว Stockton ยังคงมองโลกในแง่ดีต่อ Ethereum โดยคาดการณ์ว่าจะแข็งแกร่งกว่า Bitcoin ในท้ายที่สุด แม้ว่า Bitcoin จะแสดงความมั่นคงได้ดีในบางช่วงเวลา เธอเน้นย้ำว่าการวิเคราะห์ทางเทคนิคยังคงมีประสิทธิภาพสูงในตลาดคริปโตเนื่องจากความเป็นสากลและรูปแบบการซื้อขาย นอกจากนี้ 她还เชื่อว่าการรวมตัวของราคา (basing phase) ของ Bitcoin

This decline, which represents a 30% drop from January highs, has left traders skeptical of a near-term recovery. Options markets on Deribit reflect this bearish sentiment, pricing in only a 6% probability that Bitcoin will reclaim the $90,000 mark by late March.\n\nFurther market pressure stems from fears regarding quantum computing risks and potential forced liquidations by companies holding large Bitcoin reserves, such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet. As these firms see their enterprise values dip below their acquisition costs, investors worry that a prolonged bear market could force them to sell assets to cover debts. Consequently, the market is increasingly uncertain, with a put option at $50,000 implying a significant chance of even deeper losses.","aiSummaryThai":"ราคา Bitcoin ดิ่งลดต่ำกว่า $63,000
