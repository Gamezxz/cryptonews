71:T6e8,S&P 500 return over last 5 years before dividends: +80% (closer to 90% counting dividends).
 BTC total return over last 5 years: +62%.
 In fact, BTC has even underperformed the conservative Dow Jones over the last 5 years now, and it's been absolutely demolished by gold's +153% return. Could any long term holder imagine BTC getting less than half the return of a yellow rock, despite having max drawdowns 5x as large?
 This is the first time it has underperformed the S&P 500 over a 5 year period. Each cycle produces worse risk-adjusted returns as the new ATH becomes a smaller multiple of the old ATH, yet the drops remain nearly as large as before.
 2012 - 2013: ~600x returns followed by -87% decline
 2015-2017: ~125x returns followed by -84% decline
 2018-2021: ~22x returns followed by -77% decline
 2023-2025: ~8x returns followed by -50% decline (so far)
 Or expressed as multiples of the prior ATH:
 2017 high was 17x 2013 high
 2021 high was 3.5x 2017 high
 2025 high was 1.8x 2021 high
 The current bear market in crypto should not surprise or worry anyone, as it's right on time given crypto's history. What should worry folks is that the magnitude of the rallies in between bear markets are shrinking much faster than the magnitude of the bear market drawdowns. This pattern indicates that BTC has become a much worse investment from a risk/reward perspective.
 Edit: Oddly people are debating the basic facts of this post. Bitcoin closed at $39k exactly 5 years ago, check Trading View, CoinMarketCap, or whatever your favorite daily price history source is. Today it's at $63k. It's not that hard to look up the daily price history and do basic division.

72:T42b,I accumulated 1.18 more and bought a total of 1.60 BTC today. I had been patiently waiting for a pullback in the $66,000–$70,000 range, and the opportunity finally presented itself.
 If the market corrects further, I’m prepared to add more around the $53,000 level as well.
 This is a personal, well-considered decision aligned with my financial position. Even in an extreme downside scenario, it would not materially impact me. I’m not recommending this to anyone—cryptocurrency remains highly volatile and risky. This approach is only suitable for those who can tolerate significant risk and are financially comfortable even in the event of a loss.
 Despite widespread bearish predictions ranging from $16K to $10K, I’m sticking to my own strategy and long-term conviction. Having already achieved returns far exceeding my current investment through futures and forex, I’m comfortable taking this calculated exposure. Staying disciplined, focused, and patient.
 Good luck to everyone. HODL.

73:T59f,This is my 3rd bear market so far. These are the things that I learned the hard way. 
 -BTC will always go lower than you think it will. 
 - leverage is not bad if you only use 10% or less of your stack and are willing to cough up another 10% to not get liquidated. 
 - there are relief rallies along the way down. Just ignore them and please don’t buy into them. 
 - pick up a hobby like running, swimming, maybe even traveling. This helps clear the cortisol and reduce stress. It works. 
 -Don’t listen to social media, X, or your favorite YouTuber. Everyone at this moment is wrong and knows absolutely nothing. Instead enjoy art, food, family time, fitness, music, movies. 
 -Remember why you invested in Bitcoin in the first place. This is not a 2,5,10 year investment, I plan to leave my coinage to my children I’m thinking 50-60 years. 
 -Remember to buy what you can when you can at new 52 week lows. It might still fall lower but at least you didn’t buy into tops or fake outs. 
 - move in silence. 
 Hope this helps. I’m stacking from $80k down. My first buy was $4,000 and I have bought all the way up to $110,000. I take out BTC backed loans and use margin. It’s scary but don’t let greed take over have a plan write it down and stick to it. Don’t allow the little voice in your head to act on greed just be smart and everything will work out.

 And yet, there still is hundreds of millions of unrealized profit in just the Bitcoin, ETH and SOL.
 Altcoins too and by now, even most Silver and Gold Shorts are turning green.
 Biggest Bitcoin Short that's still open:
 0x1b526ff54f9f66c777fd34b7a802bb8d216ed41b 800.5 BTC, entered ~92k, 17 Million UPnL
 Biggest ETH:
 0x20c2d95a3dfdca9e9ad12794d5fa6fad99da44f5 ~17k ETH, entry at 3115, ~ 18 Million Dollars UPnL
 Biggest SOL:
 0x06cecfbac34101ae41c88ebc2450f8602b3d164b ~88k SOL entry at an insane 172$! UPnL 7 Million, note this one already cashed out millions. That's just what's left. This one also has BTC and ETH Shorts, still around 10 million to cash out on.
 There is also a 35 Million Silver Short 0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05 though it closed most of it's position overnight, still around 1 million profit left. Entry was 83$

75:T47d,Crypto analyst and creator of the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model PlanB, has discussed four possible outcomes for Bitcoin’s current bear market. The analysis follows a sharp drawdown of over 40% from Bitcoin’s all-time high of above $126,000
 Scenario One: 80% Correction From the Peak
 The first scenario assumes Bitcoin repeats its deepest historical declines. An 80% drop from the $126,000 high would push the price toward $25,000.
 Scenario Two: Return to Long-Term Averages
 The second scenario targets a move down to the 200-week moving average and realized price. These levels currently sit between $50,000 and $60,000.
 Scenario Three: Support Above the Prior Cycle High
 The third path assumes a shallow bear market. Under this view, Bitcoin holds just above the previous cycle’s all-time high near $69,000, placing a potential floor around $70,000.
 Scenario Four: Local Bottom Already Formed
 The fourth scenario suggests Bitcoin may have already bottomed. Price briefly touched $72,900 earlier this week, which PlanB said could mark a local low if the bear market remains shallow.
