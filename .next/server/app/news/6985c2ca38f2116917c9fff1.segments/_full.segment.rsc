STORY CONTINUES BELOW IREN secured $3.6 billion of GPU financing for its Microsoft contract which together with a $1.9 billion customer prepayment is expected to cover around 95% of GPU related capex. Tech giant Amazon (AMZ) also missed expectations on EPS but beat on revenue , according to investing.com. Investor focus shifted to management’s plan to spend around $200 billion on capex in 2026, primarily AI related. Amazon shares are down 10%.

The bold strategy was seen as risky at one point, as the leading cryptocurrency is known for its extreme volatility. While using money from your own account is one thing, taking personal loans takes it to a whole different level. Bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted, as a crash can erase all profits in a jiffy. I n a recent Reddit post, the user highlighted that he purchased BTC using personal loans at an average price of $35,000 over four years. In total, the trader accumulated 4.75 BTC using this innovative method. However, he continued to repay the loans with funds from his day job. Also Read: Bitcoin Fell To $15k In 2022, Then Hit $100k In 2024: A Pattern? Is the Brave Bitcoin Trader in Profit or Regretting His Decision Now? Source: Shutterstock / In Green, modified by Blockworks At the time of the Reddit post, Bitcoin was trading at $76,000 level on Thursday and began attracting attracting bearish sentiments. Moreover, the trader’s wallet had ballooned to $356,000 early February 2026. That’s an unrealized profit of approximately 113% in just four years. This makes the risk worth it as his investment has more than doubled in value. The investor also revealed that he’ll be throwing in more money each month if Bitcoin dips below $70,000. He called it the perfect buying opportunity again, despite still paying off his personal loans to acquire BTC. The risk-to-reward ratio is extremely high in this scenario, but it has paid off handsomely. BTC experienced a major crash on Friday falling to the $65,000 level. The trader also revealed that he plans to take another $50,000 in personal loans if Bitcoin falls further in value. “In the meantime, I’m throwing everything I can at it each month while we’re in the $70-80k range with earned income from my job. I’ve been stacking this whole time while paying down the loans,” he wrote. Note: The post was made on Reddit, and Watcher Guru could not independently verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin holder.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985c2ca38f2116917c9fff1","guid":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-record-10k-drop-model-93-5k-only-return-2028","__v":0,"author":"Cointelegraph by William Suberg","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Bitcoin fell by more than $10,000 in a single day for the first time, with BTC price bear market analysis warning that a rebound could take several years.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T10:30:34.211Z","enclosure":"https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/528_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjYtMDIvMDE5YzMyMjMtN2U5ZS03NDEwLThmOTQtMzM0NmRlZDc5ZGM2LmpwZw==.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T10:30:34.212Z","link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-record-10k-drop-model-93-5k-only-return-2028?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound","pubDate":"2026-02-06T10:20:22.000Z","sentiment":"bearish","source":"Cointelegraph","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"Bitcoin sees record $10K drop as model says  $93.5K may only return in 2028","translatedContent":"Bitcoin ร่วงลงมากกว่า 10,000 ดอลลาร์ในเวลาเพียงวันเดียวเป็นครั้งแรก โดยการวิเคราะห์ตลาดหมีของราคา BTC เตือนว่าการฟื้นตัวอาจใช้เวลาหลายปี","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin ร่วงลง 10,000 ดอลลาร์สถิติใหม่ หลังโมเดลคาดว่า 93,500 ดอลลาร์อาจกลับมาได้ในปี 2028","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:30:36.171Z","aiSummary":"Bitcoin experienced its largest single-day drop in history, falling over $10,000 and liquidating $2.6 billion in crypto positions.
