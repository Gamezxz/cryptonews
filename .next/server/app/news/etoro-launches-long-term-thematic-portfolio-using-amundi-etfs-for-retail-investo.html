In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

and investing platform eToro has partnered with\nasset manager Amundi to launch a new investment portfolio focused on long-term\nglobal themes.\nThe new product is called the Key Themes \u0026 Convictions\nPortfolio. It is built using Amundi exchange-traded funds and is designed for\nretail investors seeking diversified exposure to global equity markets.\nThe launch follows eToro’s\nmove last month to add 250 UCITS-structured exchange-traded funds to its\nEuropean platform. That expansion was aimed at strengthening its long-term\ninvestment offering for retail clients. \nThe additions came as European\ninvestors continue to favor UCITS products for regulatory protection and\ntransparency. They also come amid rising competition from larger brokerages\noffering similar ETF access.\neToro Offers Portfolio Following Global Trends\nGil Shapira, Chief Investment Officer at eToro, said\ninvesting is about “anticipating what will shape” markets. He added that the\npartnership allows users to access a portfolio that follows broad market trends\nwhile focusing on long-term themes.\nMost of the portfolio is allocated to broad equity exposure.\nThis allocation reflects Amundi’s strategic and tactical views on global\nmarkets. The remaining portion is invested in selected ETFs linked to three\nlong-term themes identified by Amundi.\nPortfolio Targets Environment, Social, Technology Themes\nThese themes include environment and resources, social and\ndemographic change, and technology. Related sub-themes cover areas such as\nalternative energy, healthcare, aging populations, artificial intelligence, and\nrobotics.\n\n🚨 BREAKING: 🇪🇺 Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, has launched the first tokenized money-market fund.Invest with traditional shares or on-chain via blockchain: full transparency, instant orders, 24/7 access.EUROPE IS ALL IN ON RWA 🔥 pic.twitter.com/ITGWDTgFop\n— Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) November 27, 2025\nAlongside the portfolio launch, eToro has added 120 Amundi\nETFs to its platform. These products cover multiple asset classes, including\nequities, fixed income, and commodities.\nUsers Track Performance Through Platform Tools\nThe portfolio is part of eToro’s Smart Portfolios range.\nThese products are intended for long-term investing rather than short-term\ntrading. The minimum investment required is $500.\nUsers can track performance using eToro’s tools and charts.\nUpdates related to the portfolio and its underlying themes are shared through\nthe platform’s social feed.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
