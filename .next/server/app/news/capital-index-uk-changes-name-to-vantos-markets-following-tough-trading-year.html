We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error. We close with a practical question: how retail investors can actually use AI without falling into common traps.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Index UK Limited, a UK-based CFD broker, has changed\nits legal name to Vantos Markets UK Limited, according to filings published by\nCompanies House.\nThe rebrand follows a period of financial

Capital\nIndex UK reduced its losses in 2024, returning to a pre-tax profit\nposition, although it remained loss-making after tax amid a challenging retail\ntrading environment.\nCompanies House Confirms Broker Name Change\nThe name change was registered today (Thursday), following a\nspecial resolution passed by the company’s members a day earlier. The company\nremains incorporated in England and Wales as a private company limited by\nshares and continues to operate under the same company number.\nCompanies House issued a new certificate of incorporation\nreflecting the updated name under the Companies Act. The filing indicates that\nthe change was authenticated electronically by the Registrar of Companies and\ndoes not reference any amendments to the firm’s corporate structure or\nownership.\nCFD Broker Rebrands Without Regulatory Changes\nCapital Index has operated as an FCA-regulated provider of\ncontracts for difference, offering leveraged trading across multiple asset\nclasses. The Companies House documents do not suggest that the rebrand is\naccompanied by changes to the firm’s regulatory permissions or business\nactivities.\nThe company has not publicly disclosed the rationale behind\nthe rebranding, and no further details were provided in the filing.\nUK CFD Broker Reports Net Loss\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024, the company reported a\npre-tax profit of £23,678, compared with a pre-tax loss of £207,006 a year\nearlier. However, it still recorded a net loss of £18,247 after tax, marking a\nsecond consecutive year without net profitability. \nTurnover declined by more\nthan 17% year-on-year, while administrative costs continued to outweigh gross\nprofit, with directors citing cost-of-living pressures and weaker client\nactivity in the UK market.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
