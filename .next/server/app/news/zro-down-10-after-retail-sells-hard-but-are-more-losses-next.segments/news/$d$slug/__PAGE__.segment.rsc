4:Td56,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 The altcoin market has been crashing hard since last week. In fact, major altcoins from different sectors have graced the list of the market’s biggest losers over the last 24 hours. On this front, LayerZero has led the way, losing 10% of its valuation during this period. Activity across its network has not only influenced this loss, but also the altcoin’s numerical outlook. ZRO eyes 50% Fibonacci retracement level According to the altcoin’s daily chart, ZRO had faked a breakout above the 0.786 Fibonacci Retracement level only to close below it. The retracement was deduced from 10 October’s crash that saw ZRO create a flash low of $0.315. This suggested that bears had controlled this market for more than three months. LayerZero’s drop for the day extended the weekly losses to 15%. This figure put the altcoin behind only Ripple (XRP) and ZCash (ZEC) in terms of daily losses at press time. Momentum in favour of more downside seemed to be increasing too – A sign that sellers were willing to pull the price further down. The MACD bars, becoming denser as the signal lines crossed over on the downward side, confirmed this observation. This outlook suggested a potential revisit to the 50% retracement level, which coincided with a previous resistance zone. Here, things could change as bulls could come in and view this as a retest for the area. So, caution may be warranted here. Source: ZRO/USDT on TradingView Staying below $1.718 would heighten the chances of a drop to $1.45 or lower. However, these targets could also be viewed as potential reversal points, as they house both major bulls and bears. However, one question must be answered here – Is ZRO declining only because of its weak technical outlook? Retail traders may be selling hard… No. In fact, its on-chain activity has been giving similar vibes. As per data from Etherscan, ZRO has been dropping because of intense selling from retail traders too. A sea of orders worth between $10 and slightly above $100 has been flooding DEX platforms like Uniswap (UNI) . At press time, only a few trades were long – Insignificant in number compared to shorts. Source: Etherscan These findings are evidence of sell pressure from retail traders. Even though their volume has been usually small, they represent the sentiment of the general market. This might explain why the price of ZRO fell on the charts. Transaction activity on LayerZero sliding too! Finally, the transaction activity dipped below noticeable levels too. The number of transaction counts dropped by more than 70% in about three weeks – Down from 3,479 to 981. Additionally, the number of transaction amounts fell from 27.735 million ZRO to 8.137 million ZRO over the same period. Together, these observations suggested that activity has been sliding, accelerating the price drop. Source: Etherscan Here, it’s worth noting that according to popular analyst Benjamin Cowen, the near-term outlook for the market is bearish. What about the rest of the year though? Well, the analyst expects the same for Bitcoin (BTC). He claimed , “BTC goes down and drags the rest of the market with it. Good chance this process ends later this year, so stay tuned!” Final Thoughts ZROs price crashed by 10% on the back of a bear market structure and a fall in network activity. Some analysts expect the bear market to last through 2026.0:{"buildId":"kLRWuWAJNisV6lJ7sV3o6","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69859f9d38f2116917c2e8a3","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=567938","__v":0,"author":"Lennox Gitonga","categories":["general"],"category":"general","content":"Can ZRO's market decline last through 2026?","createdAt":"2026-02-06T08:00:29.028Z","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lennox-1-1.png","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T08:00:29.028Z","link":"https://ambcrypto.com/zro-down-10-after-retail-sells-hard-but-are-more-losses-next/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T08:00:16.000Z","sentiment":"bearish","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"ZRO ลดลง 10% หลังจากการขายอ","title":"ZRO down 10% after retail sells hard, but are more losses next?","translatedContent":"การที่ตลาด ZRO ปรับตัวลงนั้นจะดำเนินต่อไปจนถึงปี 2026 หรือไม่?","translatedTitle":"ZRO ลดลง 10% หลังจากขายหนักในตลาด retail แต่มีการสูญเสียเพิ่มเติมหรือไม่?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T13:20:44.795Z","aiSummary":"LayerZero's ZRO token has fallen 10% in the last 24 hours amid a broader altcoin market crash, with weekly losses reaching 15%. Technical analysis indicates that ZRO has broken below a key Fibonacci retracement level, suggesting further downside potential. The price drop has been exacerbated by intense retail selling on DEX platforms like Uniswap, with transaction volumes showing predominantly small orders between $10-$100.\n\nThe network's fundamental metrics are also concerning, with transaction counts plummeting by over 70% in just three weeks. Market analyst Benjamin Cowen predicts the bearish trend could continue through 2026, with Bitcoin's performance likely to drag down the broader market. While there may be support levels that could trigger reversals, the current technical and on-chain indicators suggest further pain ahead for ZRO holders.","aiSummaryThai":"ZRO token ของ LayerZero ลดลง 10% ในรอบ 24 ชั่วโมงที่ผ่านมา ในช่วงที่ตลาด altcoin กำลังขาลงอย่างหนัก โดยสูญเสียมูลค่าไปถึง 15% ในรอบสัปดาห์ การวิเคราะห์ทางเทคนิคชี้ว่า ZRO ได้เบรกลงต่ำกว่าระดับ Fibonacci retracement ที่สำคัญ ซึ่งบ่งชี้ว่าอาจมีแนวโน้มลดลงต่อไป การลดลงของราคานี้ถูกเร่งให้รุนแรงขึ้นโดยการขายของ retail traders บน DEX platforms เช่น Uniswap โดยมีการสั่งซื้อขนาดเล็กระหว่าง $10-$100 อย่างหนัก\n\nข้อมูลพื้นฐานของเครือข่ายก็ไม่น่าไว้ใจเช่นกัน โดยจำนวน transactions ลดลงมากกว่า 70% ในเวลาเพียง 3 สัปดาห์ นักวิเคราะห์ตลาดอย่าง Benjamin Cowen คาดการณ์ว่าแนวโน้มการขาลงนี้อาจดำเนินต่อไปตลอดปี 2026 โดย Bitcoin จะลากตลาดใหญ่ลงไปด้วย แม้จะมีแนวรับที่อาจทำให้เกิดการกลับตัว แต่ตัวชี้วัดทางเทคนิคและ on-chain ในปัจจุบันชี้ว่า ZRO holders อาจเผชิญกับความเจ็บปวดเพิ่มเติมในอนาคต","fullContent":"$4","keyPoints":["ZRO dropped 10% in 24 hours and 15% weekly","Technical analysis shows bearish outlook with potential for further decline","Retail traders selling heavily on DEX platforms","Network activity declined by over 70% in three weeks","Analyst predicts bear market may continue through 2026"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":568,"slug":"zro-down-10-after-retail-sells-hard-but-are-more-losses-next"},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6985e72251f3090f7cf86ebc","slug":"cathies-ark-invest-sells-17m-coinbase-stock-buys-bullish-shares","title":"Cathie’s ARK Invest Sells $17M Coinbase Stock, Buys Bullish Shares","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:03:05.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"general","translatedTitle":"ARK Invest ของ Cathie ขายหุ้น Coinbase มูลค่า 17 ล้านดอลลาร์ ซื้อหุ้น Bullish"},{"_id":"6985e27151f3090f7cf85e5d","slug":"stablecoin-inflows-jump-from-51b-to-102bis-smart-money-preparing-to-buy-the-dip","title":"Stablecoin Inflows Jump From $51B to $102B—Is Smart Money Preparing to Buy the Dip?","pubDate":"2026-02-06T12:43:12.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"general","translatedTitle":"Stablecoin Inflows เพิ่มขึ้นจาก 51 พันล้านเป็น 102 พันล้านดอลลาร์—Smart Money กำลังเตรียมตัวซื้อจุดต่ำไหม?"},{"_id":"6985e60551f3090f7cf868e5","slug":"is-google-stealing-your-traffic-an-interview-with-alena-afanaseva-founder-and-ce","title":"Is Google Stealing Your Traffic?
