4:Tc89,Journalist Posted: February 7, 2026 Recent MYX Finance [MYX] momentum has shifted focus toward a potential breakout zone. MYX swept liquidity within the $4.58–$4.63 zone, triggering a sharp rebound as bids reacted at the range floor. Price then advanced, yet repeated rejection near $6.20–$6.40 capped upside, sustaining consolidation. Each pullback held above $4.63, signaling firm spot demand and persistent order-book support. Wicks in the sweep zone suggested absorption rather than panic selling. Source: TradingView As price rotated between support and supply, structure remained range-bound, not trend-decisive. Liquidation clusters around the lows appeared partially cleared, reducing immediate downside fuel. Still, failure to reclaim $6.40 kept momentum contained, leaving accumulation versus reactive dip-buying unresolved within the current range. THIS overhead supply restrains breakout structure MYX advanced into the $6.20–$6.40 resistance band multiple times, yet each attempt met firm sell-side pressure. Price printed sharp upper wicks near $6.30, reflecting active distribution rather than sustained acceptance. As rallies stalled, pullbacks rotated price toward the $5.16 pivot, preserving range structure instead of breakout continuation. Volume expanded during rejection phases, signaling sellers absorbed upside liquidity rather than exhausting supply. Meanwhile, MACD momentum began flattening after earlier expansion. Source: TradingView Histogram bars compressed toward neutral, indicating slowing upside strength. This alignment suggested momentum cooled as supply dominated overhead. Sell-side absorption remained limited, with supply refilling on each resistance test. For bullish continuation, the price required decisive, high-volume acceptance above $6.40. Until then, the persistent supply overhang continued suppressing upside extension and kept MYX locked within a capped trading range. Decoding MYX’s structural liquidity formation MYX Finance’s Perpetual Volume grew rapidly from very low levels into a steady $250 million to $300 million daily base, signaling strong derivatives adoption. Spikes near $450 million to $500 million appeared at intervals, reflecting short bursts of speculative positioning rather than purely organic flow. Source: DeFiLlama After this expansion, volume stabilized instead of falling, indicating sustained platform usage. Wider market data supported this trend. Total Perp Volume reached $70.45 billion in 24 hours, at press time, while 30-day activity exceeded $1.06 trillion, alongside $13.1 billion in Open Interest. Source: DeFiLlama This alignment pointed to broader derivatives market growth, not isolated platform activity. However, stabilization within the mid-range suggested balanced two-way trading rather than strong directional conviction. Sustained turnover reflected regular usage, while periodic spikes highlighted tactical leverage deployment within an expanding liquidity environment. Final Thoughts A break above $6.40 will determine whether the liquidity sweep evolves into a sustained bullish expansion. Sustained perp volume strength positions MYX for volatility expansion once directional conviction returns.0:{"buildId":"rPzjts34cPPlDL88LESzh","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986659a38f2116917d3f701","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=568164","__v":0,"aiSummary":"MYX Finance [MYX] recently swept liquidity in the $4.58–$4.63 zone, triggering a rebound that indicates firm spot demand. However, the price remains trapped in a consolidation phase as it faces repeated rejection at the $6.20–$6.40 resistance level. While downside risks have reduced due to cleared liquidation clusters, the inability to reclaim $6.40 leaves the market undecided between accumulation and reactive dip-buying, with technical indicators like the MACD showing flattening momentum.\n\nOn the fundamental side, MYX's Perpetual Volume has stabilized at a steady base of $250 million to $300 million daily, reflecting robust derivatives adoption. This aligns with broader market growth, where total perp volume exceeded $1 trillion over 30 days.
