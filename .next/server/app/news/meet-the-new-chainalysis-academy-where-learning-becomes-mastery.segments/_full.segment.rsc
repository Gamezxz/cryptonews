10:T23b1,Crypto doesn’t wait for your next scheduled course Crypto and crime are moving faster than most training programs can keep up with. In 2025 alone, global crypto scams reached a record $17 billion , powered by AI-generated personas, cross-chain obfuscation, and ever-more creative laundering routes. The teams on the front lines are expected to keep up with all of it, often with training that still treats “What is a blockchain?” as a big revelation. As a result, we decided to change how training works. Rather than treating training as one-off, pay-per-seat courses, we’ve built a continuous learning model that matches the pace and complexity of the work, and helps both individuals and institutions keep growing. Train with the experts who built the industry standard On 21 January, we launched the new Chainalysis Academy as part of Chainalysis Digital Asset Programs (CDAP) , bringing together two ways to learn: on-demand Academy content included with your software license, plus the option of live instructor‑led Private Training when your team needs more interactive, context-specific guidance. If you look behind many of the world’s most consequential investigations, disruptions, and recoveries, you’ll see a common thread: people trained with Chainalysis. More than 41,000 professionals across 1,500+ institutions and government agencies have earned our certifications. CDAP is how we make that expertise accessible to more teams, with Academy providing an always-on learning experience that stays current as crypto evolves and helps teams build expertise and real-world impact faster. Inside the new Academy When you log into the new Academy, you’ll see a few important shifts in how you learn: Role-based, progressive pathways Everyone now has a clear path from first exposure to real mastery. We’ve introduced two distinct learning domains — Investigations and Compliance — each with progressive tiers. You’ll start with Chainalysis Digital Asset Fundamentals (CDAF), our enhanced version of Chainalysis Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Certification (CCFC), as the prerequisite to unlocking more advanced levels over time, so you always know what “next” looks like for your role. Modular, on-demand training Training is broken into bite-sized, self-paced modules you can complete in short bursts. You can work through a full certification end-to-end or jump into specific modules when a case, audit, or project demands it, making complex topics easier to absorb, fit into your day, and actually finish. Refreshed certifications with new cases Every certification has been refreshed with case studies that reflect today’s digital asset ecosystem, threat landscape, and product capabilities. Think pig-butchering scams , AI-enabled fraud schemes , transnational money laundering networks, and other typologies you’ve seen in the headlines — all broken down into workflows and frameworks you can apply immediately. Inclusive access so everyone can learn Academy learning paths are included with every Chainalysis software subscription, with no per-user fees, and role-based access ensures learners see the courses and certifications most relevant to their work. Members of your organization can still access foundational and other learning content, so more teams can build crypto literacy together. Why Chainalysis Academy is different It’s not all theory Every certification is grounded in real cases and live examples, built by industry experts who have supported landmark investigations and designed effective compliance programs, so that you get practical playbooks, shortcuts, and judgement from the field beyond textbook definitions. Interactive quizzes, video content, and light gamification keep learning engaging and focused, instead of feeling like just another tab to ignore. It doesn’t stop at the basics Your journey starts with CDAF, then, depending on your role, you’ll build your base with Chainalysis Certified Investigator (CCI) or Chainalysis Certified Compliance Analyst (CCCA), and progress over time toward Advanced and Elite levels. Specialist courses, such as the Chainalysis Asset Seizure Certification (CASC) for government professionals, remain available as an add-on for building niche, mission-critical skills. It fits how you work Refreshed modules are short, focused, and on-demand with clear tracks across Fundamentals, Compliance, and Investigations so learners can find their starting points quickly. An investigator can brush up on a tracing technique between case steps, and a compliance lead can quickly dive into a regulatory update before meeting with supervisors or auditors. Stretch your training budgets Because Academy access is now embedded in your Chainalysis subscription, you’re not re‑buying the basics every time someone new joins or wants to level up. Existing training budgets can be used more strategically, for specialist courses like CASC, Private Training or advanced enablement through other service offerings like Ask Chain and Advanced Case Engagement to address specific gaps or high‑priority cases. What’s coming next Over the coming months, you’ll see: More roles and levels Deeper level tracks across Investigations and Compliance, including Chainalysis Certified Advanced Investigator (CCAI) and, later this year, Chainalysis Certified Elite Investigator (CCEI) — a capstone credential for complete mastery, designed for practitioners who want to operate at the very highest standard in this field. New domains such as Tax as the digital asset ecosystem matures and new specialties emerge. More languages Expanded localization with up to 19 additional languages, rolling out first across major markets like German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Korean, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Arabic, with more European and Asia-Pacific languages to follow. More specializations New specialist and product enablement courses for Hexagate, Alterya and other parts of the Chainalysis suite, so your team can quickly learn how to use more of the platform in practice. Join the 2,000 who have already started Since we went live, approximately 2,000 professionals have already begun their new certifications. If you’d also like to refresh core skills and prepare to earn advanced credentials, you can get started right now. For existing learners If you’re a Chainalysis customer outside the U.S. Government, log in to academy.chainalysis.com with your existing credentials to access the new Academy. If you’re a U.S. Government customer, continue accessing your training via the existing Chainalysis Government Solutions (CGS) Academy: training.chainalysis-gov.com . The enhanced training academy will be introduced in April 2026. Reach out to your account team with any questions. For training coordinators Work with your Chainalysis account team to make sure you have admin permissions and the right people have access. If you need to go beyond what’s available on-demand in the Academy — for example, with live Private Training or deeper support from our experts — your representative can help you plan the right approach for your team. For the curious public and early career professionals Explore basic training content , including reports and webinars, to get a feel for our approach and what our certifications cover. When your organization is ready to go deeper, we’re here to support that journey. There are many other options in the market, but most still treat training as something bolted-on with per-user certification fees or programs that sit apart from day-to-day product use. We’ve deliberately taken the opposite path: training is part of your Chainalysis value, not an afterthought, so you unlock greater capability at no extra cost. If you lead a team, ask a harder question: “What would it look like if every investigator or compliance analyst here worked to the standard of our very best people?”. The new Chainalysis Academy is our answer to that question — always current, available anytime, and designed to meet you exactly where you are.
