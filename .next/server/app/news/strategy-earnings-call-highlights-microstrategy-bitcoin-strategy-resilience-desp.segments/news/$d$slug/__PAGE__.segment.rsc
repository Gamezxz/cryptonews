4:T452,Strategy reported a net loss of $12.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings as prices fell below the company's average acquisition cost. Despite the significant loss and a recent market sell-off, CEO Phong Le reassured investors that the company's balance sheet is resilient enough to handle extreme volatility. He noted that Bitcoin would need to crash to $8,000 and remain at that level for five to six years before the firm faced a genuine risk regarding its ability to service convertible debt.

Executive Chairman Michael Saylor reiterated the company's commitment to a long-term accumulation strategy, emphasizing that the firm is built to withstand short-term price fluctuations. Addressing concerns about quantum computing, Saylor dismissed immediate fears as "FUD," suggesting a realistic threat is at least a decade away. Consequently, Strategy announced the launch of a new Bitcoin Security program aimed at collaborating with the global cybersecurity community to prepare future quantum-resistant upgrades for the Bitcoin network.5:Tafa,Strategy รายงานขาดทุนสุทธิมูลค่า 12.6 พันล้านดอลลาร์ในไตรมาสที่ 4 ปี 2024 ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่เป็นผลมาจากการบันทึกผลขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดจริงจากการถือครอง Bitcoin เนื่องจากราคาลดลงต่ำกว่าต้นทุนการซื้อเฉลี่ยของบริษัท แม้จะประสบกับความสูญเสียครั้งใหญ่และแรงขายในตลาด แต่ CEO Phong Le ยืนยันว่างบดุลของบริษัทมีความแข็งแกร่งเพียงพอที่จะรับมือกับความผันผวนที่รุนแรงได้ เขาชี้ให้เห็นว่าราคา Bitcoin จะต้องดิ่งลงเหลือ 8,000 ดอลลาร์และอยู่ที่ระดับนั้นเป็นเวลา 5 ถึง 6 ปี บริษัทจึงจะเริ่มเผชิญกับความเสี่ยงอย่างจริงจังเกี่ยวกับความสามารถในการชำระหนี้แปลงสภาพ

ประธานกรรมการบริหาร Michael Saylor ย้ำยันว่าบริษัทยังคงมุ่งมั่นในกลยุทธ์การสะสมในระยะยาว โดยเน้นว่าบริษัทได้รับการออกแบบมาเพื่อทนทานต่อการเปลี่ยนแปลงของราคาในระยะสั้น ในการตอบสนองความกังวลเรื่อง Quantum computing Saylor มองว่าความกลัวในปัจจุบันคือ "FUD" และคาดการณ์ว่าภัยคุกคามที่แท้จริงจะเกิดขึ้นในอีก 10 ปีข้างหน้า ตามมาด้วยการประกาศเปิดตัวโปรแกรม Bitcoin Security program ใหม่ของ Strategy เพื่อร่วมมือกับชุมชนความปลอดภัยไซเบอร์ทั่วโลกในการเตรียมการอัปเกรดความปลอดภัยที่ต้านทาน Quantum สำหรับเครือข่าย Bitcoin ในอนาคต6:T1a63,During a turbulent week for digital assets, Strategy executives argued that the companys reliance on microstrategy bitcoin holdings remains sustainable even under extreme downside scenarios. Summary Balance sheet stress test and bitcoin downside scenario Fourth-quarter loss and long-term strategy Quantum computing risks, FUD, and bitcoin resilience Bitcoin Security program and future outlook Balance sheet stress test and bitcoin downside scenario Strategy CEO Phong Le told investors on the fourth-quarter 2024 financial results webinar that the companys balance sheet can absorb heavy volatility in Bitcoin . However, he warned that a truly severe drawdown would eventually strain its ability to service existing obligations. Le explained that bitcoin would need to fall to $8,000 and stay there for five to six years before the firm faced a genuine risk to servicing its convertible debt . In that extreme case, the value of the companys bitcoin reserve would roughly match its net debt , limiting its capacity to repay bondholders using crypto holdings alone . In his words, a roughly 90% decline in the bitcoin price to $8,000 would mark the point where the reserve equals net debt and Strategy could no longer retire its convertibles purely with its Bitcoin reserve . At that stage, the firm would likely explore options such as restructuring , issuing new equity, or raising additional debt to manage its capital structure. The comments came during Strategy's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday , where leadership fielded questions about the impact of the recent crypto market downturn on the companys finances. Moreover, executives emphasized that their capital planning already incorporates these stress-test assumptions. Fourth-quarter loss and long-term strategy Strategy, widely recognized as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin , reported a net loss of $12.6 billion for the quarter. The result was driven largely by unrealized losses on its digital asset portfolio as bitcoins price slid below the firms average acquisition cost. Strategy CFO Andrew Kang said the figures were “obviously driven by the quarter-end decline in bitcoin s for value under our mark-to-market accounting.” However, Kang underscored that the firm remains committed to a long-horizon accumulation strategy and continues to execute despite sharp market moves. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor echoed that focus on duration. He noted that quarter-to-quarter swings “can be sharp” and “unsettling,” yet argued that the companys approach is built to withstand short-term price volatility. Moreover, he framed the current environment as consistent with Strategy's historical willingness to hold through “short-term extreme conditions.” The call took place on a day of heavy selling across crypto markets . On Thursday , bitcoin traded down about 9% over 24 hours to roughly $64,833 . At the same time, Strategy's MSTR stock fell 17.12% to close near $106.9 , erasing much of its prior rally. It is down 72% over the past six months, highlighting the equitys leverage to the underlying asset. Despite the sell-off, Saylor urged investors to focus on supportive fundamentals, including what he described as constructive shifts in U.S. regulation around digital assets. That said, he acknowledged that equity performance will remain tightly linked to swings in the Bitcoin market. Quantum computing risks, FUD, and bitcoin resilience The discussion also addressed long-running microstrategy bitcoin quantum concerns, which have circulated among critics of the network's long-term security . During the call, Saylor pushed back strongly on the narrative that quantum breakthroughs pose an imminent existential risk. He characterized many of the claims as part of a “parade of horrible FUD” targeting bitcoin . According to Saylor, the consensus among experts is that it will likely take 10 or more years before quantum computers could mount a realistic threat to the cryptographic primitives used by today's financial and security systems. Moreover, he described quantum as a “promising” but still “nascent” technology. Saylor stressed that any future quantum-capable machines would endanger not just Bitcoin , but also the broader finance and defense sectors that rely on similar cryptography. However, he noted that large-scale investment is already flowing into quantum-resistant protocols, and that Bitcoin's open-source design allows for upgrades through global consensus when needed. “Bitcoin is upgradable, and bitcoin can be upgraded to be stronger,” Saylor said, arguing that developers and institutions will respond to credible threats in a coordinated way. He added that he is optimistic humanity will confront such challenges rationally and improve critical infrastructure ahead of any widespread disruption. Bitcoin Security program and future outlook To help coordinate work on future defenses, Saylor announced that Strategy plans to launch a new Bitcoin Security program . The initiative aims to connect with global cybersecurity , crypto , and bitcoin security communities in order to support appropriate consensus and technical solutions for potential quantum-resistance upgrades. Strategy aims for the program to serve as a hub for information-sharing among researchers, protocol developers, and institutional holders. Moreover, Saylor suggested that collaborative efforts of this kind will be essential as digital assets become increasingly integrated into mainstream financial infrastructure over the coming years. Summarizing the companys position, Saylor said Strategy is “well managed, well collateralized, and responsibly structured” to endure difficult months or even multi-year cycles. He argued that the firm has already demonstrated its ability to weather previous downturns and remains prepared to do so again if the market faces further stress. In essence, Strategy's leadership used the earnings call to reassure investors that the company can handle severe price shocks, drawn-out volatility, and emerging technological risks while maintaining its core bitcoin-focused strategy.
