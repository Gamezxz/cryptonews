f:T401,The cryptocurrency market experienced a massive crash with Bitcoin plummeting from $77,000 to $60,000 in just 24 hours, resulting in $2.6 billion in liquidated positions and affecting nearly 600,000 traders. This crash erased months of gains and brought prices back to pre-US election levels from late 2024. According to analysis from the Kobeissi Letter, this appears to be part of a structural market shift that began on October 10, when $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out, fundamentally breaking market sentiment that has not recovered.

The analysts note that Bitcoin's market depth remains more than 30% below its October peak, similar to levels seen after the FTX crash in 2022, and suggest a large institutional player may have been liquidated during this violent trading session. While the market continues to suffer, analysts believe we may be approaching a bottom when "structural liquidity is restored," which will require capitulation in both price and leverage alongside maximum bearish sentiment.10:T10cd,Analysts explain what took place in the crypto markets in the past 24 hours or so, and whether the worst is behind us. It’s safe to say that this is no longer a bull phase. After all, BTC dumped by more than 50% since its October all-time high and plummeted to around $60,000 late on Thursday. But in this article, we will focus more on the events that took place yesterday than on the overall decline over the past several months. In the span of just 24 hours, the cryptocurrency plummeted from $77,000 to $60,000 in one of its worst single-day trading performances since its inception. Multiple altcoins registered even more profound losses of up to 20%, as was the case with XRP. The total value of wrecked positions in just one day shot up to $2.6 billion, according to Coinglass data. Nearly 600,000 traders were liquidated. Despite bouncing off local lows, BTC and the altcoins erased months and years of gains, returning to levels last seen before the US presidential elections at the end of 2024. During and after similar calamities, the most obvious question is why. Here’s a breakdown through the eyes of the Kobeissi Letter. What Happened? First things first, the analyst reassured that although bitcoin has plummeted by over $30,000 in the past couple of months, the “fundamental picture for crypto” has remained “vastly unchanged.” They added that the answer to why the asset class is tanking lies in the October 10 crash, when over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out . They believe “something structural” changed on that day. The answer to this question requires going back to October 10th. The most recent TOP in crypto came on October 6th, just 4 days before the -$19.5 billion record liquidation. Something structural appears to have shifted on October 10th. And, markets never truly recovered. pic.twitter.com/l07mKRBAbQ — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 5, 2026 Although BTC remained entirely rangebound for two months between November 15 and January 15, the analysts said there were brief periods of liquidation with “gaps” in both directions, which were another sign of the market’s structural collapse. They noted that sentiment is “all that matters” during crypto cycles, and it was broken after the October crash.

Analysts Explain Why BTC Just Crashed to $65K and Where the Bottom Lies “The result is a massive virtuous cycle, shifting from liquidations to sentiment deterioration, and back. Since January 24th, we have seen $10 billion worth of levered positions liquidated. That’s ~55% of the record amount seen on October 10th. It’s a structural decline.” The analysts offered more evidence showing the nature of the structural collapse, including the spread of selling pressure into other asset classes, and that BTC’s market depth, the capital available to absorb large orders, is still more than 30% below its October peak. The latest time it hit such numbers was after the FTX crash in 2022. Lastly, the Kobeissi Letter indicated that a large player, perhaps an institution, sold or was liquidated during the violent trading session, given BTC’s rapid and massive correction. Today’s decline was particularly noteworthy as Bitcoin fell over -$9,000 and selling pressure was constant. At times, Bitcoin would fall $2,000+ in a matter of minutes. It seems that a large player, perhaps an institutional investor, sold/liquidated during today’s session. pic.twitter.com/EWnLxUT1Vl — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 5, 2026 When Bottom? The second popular question after a crypto market collapse is whether we have bottomed out or if there is more pain ahead. The analysts answered that bitcoin would bottom once “structural liquidity is restored.” “This will be a combination of both capitulation in price and leverage, as well as maximum bearish sentiment.” The good news is that they added, “we seem to be somewhat near that point.” SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer). Tags:11:T689,Several Ethereum whales are at risk of major liquidations as ETH trades near $1,900. Trend Research leads with 356,000 ETH ($671 million) vulnerable between $1,562 and $1,698, followed by Joseph Lubin with 293,000 ETH ($553 million) and the “7 Siblings” group with 287,000 ETH ($541 million) exposed near $1,029 to $1,075. Trend Research recently sold 170,000 ETH ($322 million) and repaid $344 million in loans, reducing exposure. If ETH prices drop further, forced liquidations could trigger sell-offs, though adding collateral may help whales avoid wipeouts.

Feb 6, 2026, 11:14 a.m. IREN (IREN) earnings showed weaker than expected headline results, with the company missing consensus on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as it accelerates its transition from bitcoin mining to AI Cloud. Financially, Q2 revenue declined to $184.7 million, missing expectations and down from $240.3 million in Q1, while the company reported a net loss of $155.4 million, also below consensus. STORY CONTINUES BELOW IREN secured $3.6 billion of GPU financing for its Microsoft contract which together with a $1.9 billion customer prepayment is expected to cover around 95% of GPU related capex. Tech giant Amazon (AMZ) also missed expectations on EPS but beat on revenue , according to investing.com. Investor focus shifted to management’s plan to spend around $200 billion on capex in 2026, primarily AI related. Amazon shares are down 10%. Pre-market update Bitcoin rebounded from around $60,000 to $66,000, driving a broad rally across crypto exposed equities. Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, rose 7% in pre-market trading, mirroring a 7% gain for Galaxy (GLXY) and MARA Holdings (MARA) while Coinbase (COIN) increased by 6%.13:T673,Cardano founder and former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson revealed in a livestream called Red Days that his crypto holdings have lost over 3 billion dollars as Bitcoin fell below 66,000 and ADA dropped to 0.25, down 92 percent from its 2021 peak. Hoskinson stressed his commitment to blockchain technology over profit, saying money is not his motivation, and he would stay dedicated even after such losses. He highlighted his clean record compared to scandals like FTX and urged the community to keep building despite market volatility.

The bold strategy was seen as risky at one point, as the leading cryptocurrency is known for its extreme volatility. While using money from your own account is one thing, taking personal loans takes it to a whole different level. Bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted, as a crash can erase all profits in a jiffy. I n a recent Reddit post, the user highlighted that he purchased BTC using personal loans at an average price of $35,000 over four years. In total, the trader accumulated 4.75 BTC using this innovative method. However, he continued to repay the loans with funds from his day job. Also Read: Bitcoin Fell To $15k In 2022, Then Hit $100k In 2024: A Pattern? Is the Brave Bitcoin Trader in Profit or Regretting His Decision Now? Source: Shutterstock / In Green, modified by Blockworks At the time of the Reddit post, Bitcoin was trading at $76,000 level on Thursday and began attracting attracting bearish sentiments. Moreover, the trader’s wallet had ballooned to $356,000 early February 2026. That’s an unrealized profit of approximately 113% in just four years. This makes the risk worth it as his investment has more than doubled in value. The investor also revealed that he’ll be throwing in more money each month if Bitcoin dips below $70,000. He called it the perfect buying opportunity again, despite still paying off his personal loans to acquire BTC. The risk-to-reward ratio is extremely high in this scenario, but it has paid off handsomely. BTC experienced a major crash on Friday falling to the $65,000 level. The trader also revealed that he plans to take another $50,000 in personal loans if Bitcoin falls further in value. “In the meantime, I’m throwing everything I can at it each month while we’re in the $70-80k range with earned income from my job. I’ve been stacking this whole time while paying down the loans,” he wrote. Note: The post was made on Reddit, and Watcher Guru could not independently verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin holder.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985a50938f2116917c428a7","guid":"https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1428049","__v":0,"author":"Jordan Lyanchev","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Analysts explain what took place in the crypto markets in the past 24 hours or so, and whether the worst is behind us.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T08:23:37.588Z","enclosure":"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bitcoin_Red_Decline.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T08:23:37.588Z","link":"https://cryptopotato.com/2-6-billion-thursday-wipeout-what-triggered-the-latest-bitcoin-and-altcoin-crash/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T08:20:10.000Z","sentiment":"bearish","source":"CryptoPotato","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"ตลาดคริปโตพบการ","title":"$$2.6 Billion Thursday Wipeout: What Triggered the Latest Bitcoin and Altcoin Crash?","translatedContent":"นักวิเคราะห์อธิบายสิ่งที่เกิดขึ้นในตลาดคริปโตในช่วง 24 ชั่วโมงที่ผ่านมา และว่าช่วงเวลาที่เลวร้ายที่สุดผ่านพ้นไปแล้วหรือไม่","translatedTitle":"การชำระล้างมูลค่า 2.6 พันล้านดอลลาร์ในวันพฤหัส: อะไรคือสาเหตุของการตกลงของ Bitcoin และ Altcoin ครั้งล่าสุด?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:30:38.195Z","aiSummary":"$f","aiSummaryThai":"ตลาด cryptocurrency ประสบกับการทรุดตัวอย่างรุนแรงเมื่อ Bitcoin ร่วงลงจาก $77,000 เป็น $60,000 ภายในเพียง 24 ชั่วโมง ส่งผลให้มีตำแหน่งที่ถูก liquidate มูลค่า $2.6 พันล้านดอลลาร์ และส่งผลกระทบต่อนักเทรดเกือบ 600,000 ราย การทรุดตัวครั้งนี้ลบล้างกำไรที่สะสมมาเป็นเดือนและพาราคากลับไปสู่ระดับก่อนการเลือกตั้งสหรัฐในปลายปี 2024 ตามการวิเคราะห์จาก Kobeissi Letter สิ่งนี้ดูเหมือนเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของการเปลี่ยนแปลงโครงสร้างตลาดที่เริ่มขึ้นเมื่อวันที่ 10 ตุลาคม เมื่อตำแหน่งที่ใช้เลเวอเรจมูลค่า $19 พันล้านถูกทำลาย ซึ่งทำลายความรู้สึกเชิงบวกของตลาดอย่างร้ายแรงและยังไม่ฟื้นตัว\n\nนักวิเคราะห์ชี้ให้เห็นว่าความลึกของตลาด Bitcoin ยังคงต่ำกว่า 30% เมื่อเทียบกับจุดสูงสุดในเดือนตุลาคม ซึ่งใกล้เคียงกับระดับที่เคยเกิดขึ้นหลังจากการล่มสลายของ FTX ในปี 2022 และมีข้อสังเกตว่าผู้เล่นรายใหญ่อาจเป็นสถาบันที่ถูก liquidate ระหว่างช่วงการเทรดที่รุนแรงนี้ แม้ตลาดจะยังคงประสบปัญหา นักวิเคราะห์เชื่อว่าเราอาจกำลังใกล้ถึงจุดพื้นตลาด เมื่อ \"สภาพคล่องโครงสร้างกลับคืนมา\" ซึ่งจะต้องมีการขายทิ้งทั้งในด้านราคาและเลเวอเรจ พร้อมกับความรู้สึกเชิงลบที่สูงสุด","fullContent":"$10","keyPoints":["Bitcoin plummeted from $77,000 to $60,000 in 24 hours, liquidating $2.6 billion in positions","Analysts point to October 10 as the start of a structural market shift when $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out","Market sentiment remains broken with Bitcoin's market depth still 30% below October peak","A large institutional player may have been liquidated during the crash","Analysts suggest we may be approaching a market bottom when structural liquidity is restored"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":682},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6985d0df38f2116917cacaa4","guid":"https://coinpedia.org/?p=541908","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Ethereum whales are facing significant liquidation risks as ETH trades near $1,900, with over $1.7 billion in potential liquidations at stake.
