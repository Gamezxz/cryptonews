4:Td75,Precious metals hit new highs this week. Bitcoin meanwhile plunged to a two-month low. The cryptocurrency’s “digital gold” narrative is again being tested. Gold touched a new all-time high this week while Bitcoin slumped to its lowest level since November. Despite gold experiencing more volatility and plunging on Friday, it has still outperformed Bitcoin over the past five years, which begs the question: What exactly is happening with so-called digital gold? Bitcoin was trading for $83,926 just after 3:00 pm in New York after dropping 7% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko. Over the past year, the leading cryptocurrency is down 20%. “Bitcoin has never been a consistent safe haven, it’s much more volatile than gold with multiple double digit drawdowns,” Nansen research analyst Jake Kennis told DL News. Bitcoin in the past has been described as digital gold: a safe haven asset to go to at times of uncertainty. And it has — albeit rarely — played that role. The digital gold narrative Bitcoiners have frequently described the digital asset as digital gold because it has a finite supply. Indeed, over the long-run, it has worked as a long-term store of value: Over the past five years, it has risen by over 150% relative to the US dollar. And there have been instances when the oldest cryptocurrency has moved in tandem with the precious metal: During the 2023 US banking crisis , for example, investors flocked to both gold and Bitcoin. But Bitcoin’s correlation with gold is generally rare, and most of the time, the cryptocurrency performs like other volatile assets, particularly tech stocks. “It shows occasional safe-haven characteristics in specific scenarios but remains fundamentally a risk asset, not ‘digital gold’, as of yet,” added Kennis. Another factor, according to experts, is related to liquidity. “The divergence between gold and Bitcoin might seem to shake the ‘digital gold’ narrative, but the issue lies in asynchronous pricing logic,” Tim Sun, senior researcher at HashKey Group, said. He added that traders investing in the precious metal are focused on long-term macro imbalances and sovereign credit risk, while Bitcoin buyers are a different breed. Bitcoin remains a “liquidity-sensitive macro asset,” Sun said — that is, it’s sensitive to leveraged, high-frequency buyers, rather than those hedging against issues in the world economy. Highs then lows And it was leveraged trades that battered Bitcoin in October when, not long after breaking a new high of $126,080, a $19 billion wave of liquidations sent the coin’s price plunging. It has since struggled to regain ground following the brutal crash — the biggest in crypto’s history — trading mostly well below the $100,000 mark. Despite traders last year touting Bitcoin as a key part of the so-called debasement trade — hedging against a currency’s devaluation — the coin has failed to perform this week, while precious metals soared off the back of the dollar’s dip . Still, some experts have said the asset is in a class of its own and, while not quite “digital gold,” will benefit from looser monetary policy this year. By 2035, Bitcoin will capture a whopping one-third of the global store-of-value market, analysts from research firm CF Benchmarks said last month.

Despite Bitcoin's long-term rise of over 150% relative to the US dollar over five years, gold has recently outperformed it, raising questions about Bitcoin's status as a safe haven asset. Experts note that Bitcoin's correlation with gold is generally rare, with the cryptocurrency typically behaving like other volatile assets, particularly tech stocks. The divergence is attributed to different investor motivations and liquidity dynamics, as Bitcoin remains sensitive to leveraged, high-frequency trading rather than being driven by macroeconomic hedging concerns.","aiSummaryThai":"บทบาท 'ทองคำดิจิทัล' ของ Bitcoin กำลังถูกท้าทายใหม่ เนื่องจากโลหะมีค่า โดยเฉพาะทองคำ สามารถทำสถิติสูงสุดใหม่ในขณะที่สกุลเงินดิจิทัลตกต่ำถึงระดับต่ำสุดในสองเดือน แม้ Bitcoin จะมีมูลค่าเพิ่มขึ้นกว่า 150% ในระยะ 5 ปี แต่ทองคำก็ยังแซงหน้าไปได้ ทำให้เกิดคำถามเกี่ยวกับสถานะของ Bitcoin เป็นสินทรัพย์ปลอดภัย ผู้เชี่ยวชาญชี้ว่า Bitcoin มีความสัมพันธ์กับทองคำน้อยมาก และโดยทั่วไปมักทำหน้าที่เหมือนสินทรัพย์ที่ผันผันอื่นๆ โดยเฉพาะหุ้นเทคโนโลยี ความแตกต่างนี้เกิดจากแรงจูงใจและปัจจัยเศรษฐศาสตร์ที่แตกต่างกันระหว่างทองคำและ Bitcoin","keyPoints":["Gold reaches new highs while Bitcoin plummets to two-month low","Bitcoin's 'digital gold' narrative questioned as gold outperforms it over five years","Bitcoin shows rare correlation with gold, typically behaves like volatile tech stocks","Different investor motivations and liquidity dynamics between gold and Bitcoin","Bitcoin battered by leveraged trades in October, struggling to recover","Some analysts still believe Bitcoin will benefit from looser monetary policy"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":550,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.962Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.962Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T00:37:15.655Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"698689ef38f2116917d5b388","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:28:01.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-selloff-sparks-hedge-fund-speculation-around-blackrock-etf","source":"The Defiant","title":"Bitcoin Selloff Sparks Hedge Fund Speculation Around BlackRock ETF","translatedTitle":"การขาย Bitcoin ทำให้เกิดการคาดเดาเกี่ยวกกองทุนเฮดจ์ฟันด์ของ BlackRock ETF"},{"_id":"6986841238f2116917d57493","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:01:00.000Z","slug":"crypto-market-review-500000000-in-xrp-buying-volume-shiba-inu-shib-surprisingly-","source":"U.Today","title":"Crypto Market Review: $500,000,000 in XRP Buying Volume, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Surprisingly Bullish, Will Bitcoin (BTC) Be Saved Before $50,000?","translatedTitle":"รีวิวตลาดคริปโต: ปริมาณการซื้อ XRP ครั้งใหญ่ 500 ล้านดอลลาร์, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ทำกำไรได้น่าตื่นเต้น, Bitcoin (BTC) จะหลบหลีกจากการตกลงถึง 50,000 หรือไม่?"},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c32","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:00:01.000Z","slug":"hardware-wallets-and-secure-elements-what-are-you-really-trusting","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Hardware Wallets And Secure Elements: What Are You Really Trusting?","translatedTitle":"วอลเล็ตฮาร์ดแวร์และ Secure Elements: คุณสามารถวางใจได้อย่างแท้จริง?"},{"_id":"69867be538f2116917d4edf5","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T23:37:52.000Z","slug":"ethereum-lets-go-of-the-rollup-story-here-are-the-6-tokens-that-benefit","source":"Unchained","title":"Ethereum Lets Go of the Rollup Story.
