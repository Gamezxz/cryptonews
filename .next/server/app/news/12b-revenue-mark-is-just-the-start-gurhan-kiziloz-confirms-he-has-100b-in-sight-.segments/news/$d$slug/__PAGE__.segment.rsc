Nexus International hits $1.2 billion revenue as billionaire Gurhan Kiziloz sets sights on $100 billon long-term growth. Summary Nexus International hits $1.2b revenue as founder Gurhan Kiziloz targets $100b without outside investors. After five bankruptcies, Gurhan Kiziloz has built a $1.2b revenue empire while retaining full ownership. Spartans.com’s casino-only strategy powers Nexus growth, avoiding dilution while competing with Stake and bet365. Gurhan Kiziloz , the self-made billionaire behind Nexus International, is not one to celebrate mid-journey. His company just crossed $1.2 billion in annual revenue for 2025, triple its 2024 performance, and yet he’s already thinking ten steps ahead. “We’re not calling $1.2 billion a milestone,” Kiziloz said in a recent interview. “There’s much more scale to build. I’d call $100 billion a turning point. That’s where we’re going .” For most founders, that kind of revenue would signal a peak. For Kiziloz, it barely registers as a checkpoint. The entrepreneur who once faced five bankruptcies is now the sole owner of a company that competes with billion-dollar operators, without raising a single dollar in venture capital. And he’s openly stating that $100 billion is the number that will define his long-term ambition. The numbers are clear. In 2024, Nexus International reported $400 million in revenue. By the end of 2025, that number hit $1.2 billion. The 200% year-on-year increase marks the largest single-period growth in the company’s history and puts it firmly in the league of mid-sized global operators. But what makes Nexus different isn’t just the scale, it’s the structure. The company has no external investors. Every dollar used for growth comes from retained earnings. Kiziloz has maintained full ownership of the parent company throughout this expansion, bypassing the equity dilution that usually follows hypergrowth. The biggest contributor to Nexus’s revenue explosion is Spartans.com, a casino-only gaming platform that goes head-to-head with names like Stake and bet365. Unlike most competitors, Spartans.com doesn’t combine casino and sportsbook offerings. It’s intentionally focused, designed to dominate the casino niche rather than spread thin across multiple verticals. In 2025 alone, Spartans.com absorbed $200 million in platform reinvestment, every cent funded internally. This operational discipline has become a hallmark of the Nexus playbook: scale only when the existing product is cash-generative, and never dilute ownership to fuel expansion. The remaining portfolio includes Megaposta, a licensed Latin American brand, and Lanistar, a platform tailored for Europe. While both contribute to the overall structure, Spartans remains the driving force behind the company’s financial ascent. What makes Kiziloz’s model unique isn’t just that he avoided venture funding. It’s how he used that constraint as a structural advantage. Without external capital, there’s no boardroom politics, no investor timelines, and no incentive to inflate short-term metrics for the sake of fundraising optics. Decisions are made fast, costs are tightly controlled, and accountability rests entirely with Kiziloz and his internal team. The numbers reflect that clarity. The company reinvested $200 million in 2025 into tech, compliance, and platform architecture, without tapping into credit lines or private equity. That’s rare in a sector where expansion is almost always debt- or dilution-fueled. It’s easy to misread Kiziloz’s $100 billion target as bravado. But for him, it’s about building a durable model that doesn’t depend on narrative cycles or temporary hype. The $1.2 billion revenue mark is a milestone, yes, but it’s not the story. The story is that he got there without giving up ownership, without artificial growth, and without compromising execution standards. “I think the future of high-scale businesses will look more like this,” he said. “You don’t need to raise to grow. You need to build things that work and keep control while doing it.” That approach stands in contrast to most of today’s unicorns, many of which are propped up by billions in funding with no clear path to profitability. Nexus has already crossed the profitability line. And it’s doing so with a product-first, capital-efficient mindset that remains rare, especially in online gaming. Nexus has not issued public guidance for 2026, nor has it broken down revenue by platform or geography. Kiziloz’s philosophy is not to speculate forward but to let operational output speak for itself. But if past performance is any indication, Nexus International is not slowing down. With Spartans.com driving volume, and Megaposta continuing to benefit from early market entry in Brazil, the company’s momentum is clear. And unlike its competitors, Nexus doesn’t have to wait for board approvals or capital calls to deploy that momentum. The result is a structure that moves faster, adapts more precisely, and scales without compromise. Gurhan Kiziloz’s story isn’t clean or conventional. He went bankrupt five times before finding the formula that stuck. That formula was simple: eliminate what doesn’t work, double down on what does, and keep ownership at all costs. Today, with a $1.7 billion personal net worth and a business generating $1.2 billion annually, the math proves that approach works. But for Kiziloz, it’s still early. Because the goal was never just survival. The goal, as he says, is to reach the turning point. And that number is $100 billion. This article was prepared in collaboration with BlockDAG.
