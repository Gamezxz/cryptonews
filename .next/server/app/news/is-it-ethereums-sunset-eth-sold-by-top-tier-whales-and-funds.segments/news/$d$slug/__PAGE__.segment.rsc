Ethereum is going through one of its most aggressive sell-off periods in recent memory as funds, ecosystem insiders and major holders all try to limit their exposure. As volatility increases and ETH moves closer to the psychologically crucial $2,000 zone, on-chain data now reveals a wave of forced selling and liquidation avoidance from some of the largest market players. Large holders start selling The founder of Aave, Stani Kulechov, sent out the most recent signal just hours ago when he sold 4,503 ETH for about $8.36 million at about $1,857. These actions by prominent ecosystem players are rarely ignored and frequently heighten market anxieties, particularly in times of unstable markets. ETH/USDT Chart by TradingView Large amounts of ETH are still being sold by Trend Research to exchanges at the moment. In an effort to sell and lessen its exposure to debt, the fund recently sent Binance 20,000 Ethereum, or $38.6 million. With $343.77 million in debt and liquidation thresholds ranging from $1,509 to $1,800, Trend Research currently has 416,149 ETH on Aave valued at almost $791 million. HOT Stories That is not the end of the pressure. Additional reports indicate that wallets may be connected to Konstantin Lomashuk, a well-known ETH user and cofounder of P2P.org and cyber. His fund transferred 12,458 stETH and 2,566 ETH, or about $29 million, to Wintermute. This is usually a sign that market sales or liquidity operations are about to begin.
