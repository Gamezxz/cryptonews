4:T8b5,Bitcoin rises past $68,000, extending bounce from Thursday's crash Strategy, MARA Holdings and Galaxy Digital are among crypto-related stocks posting double-digit percentage gains early Friday. Feb 6, 2026, 3:18 p.m. Crypto markets are adding to overnight gains in U.S. morning trade on Friday, with bitcoin BTC $65,998.81 climbing above $68,000, up about 13% since hitting $60,000 late yesterday. Even with the bounce, bitcoin remains down 2% over the past 24 hours. Ether ETH $1,926.58 is lower by 3% and solana SOL $81.57 by 5%. Outperforming is XRP XRP $1.3696 , which has climbed to $1.47, now higher by 8% over the last day. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Crypto-related stocks are seeing major upside moves Friday after plunging in the previous session. Strategy (MSTR) — which reported a $14.2 billion fourth-quarter loss late Thursdy — is higher by 14%, though at $122, still lower by 22% year-to-date. Galaxy Digital (GLXY) is up 15% and bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) is up 12%. Underperforming on Friday is bitcoin miner-turned AI infrastructure provider IREN (IREN), down 1.8% after disappointing earnings results Thursday night. Saylor gets serious about Quantum Those looking for bottom signals are pointing to last night's Strategy earnings call in which Michael Saylor pledged a commitment to leading a Bitcoin security program that will address the quantum threat. Some in crypto have argued that bitcoin's security model faces a serious threat from quantum computing — a threat so imminent that many investors are either selling or refusing to allocate to bitcoin at all. "Saylor’s announcement tells me prices have finally gotten the Bitcoin community to acknowledge and address quantum risk," wrote Quinn Thompson . Poised for technical bounce Paul Howard, director at crypto trading firm Wincent, noted that bitcoin is now back at price levels last seen 14 months ago — a technical setup that often invites at least a short-term bounce. "It would be odd if we did not see at least some short term reversion here," he said, especially with RSI flashing oversold conditions. He added that trading volumes in BTC and ETH have surged to their highest in over two years — more than double 2024–25 levels0:{"buildId":"nyNMduq-QDcIzXqHG9EwS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"698606d0bd1d672632b596a2","guid":"6979983a-2f05-41f4-85c3-7f6e03502d4f","slug":"bitcoin-rises-past-68000-extending-bounce-from-thursdays-crash","title":"Bitcoin rises above $70,000, extending bounce from Thursday's crash","link":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/bitcoin-rises-to-usd70-000-extending-bounce-from-thursday-s-crash","pubDate":"2026-02-06T15:18:08.000Z","content":"Strategy, MARA Holdings and Galaxy Digital are among crypto-related stocks posting double-digit percentage gains early Friday.","author":"Stephen Alpher","enclosure":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d79c21764d6309c55ad6f450bc4a450283db356e-1900x1172.png?fm=jpg&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","source":"CoinDesk","sourceCategory":"general","category":"bitcoin","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin พุ่งทะลุ $68,000 ขยายการฟื้นตัวหลังจากการดิ่งลงเมื่อวันพฤหัสบดี","translatedContent":"Strategy, MARA Holdings และ Galaxy Digital ต่างอยู่ในกลุ่มหุ้นที่เกี่ยวข้องกับ crypto ที่ปรับตัวขึ้นเป็นเปอร์เซ็นต์สองหลักในช่วงเช้าวันศุกร์","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$4","aiSummary":"Bitcoin rebounded to climb past $68,000, extending a recovery from Thursday's sharp decline, though it remains down 2% over the last 24 hours.
