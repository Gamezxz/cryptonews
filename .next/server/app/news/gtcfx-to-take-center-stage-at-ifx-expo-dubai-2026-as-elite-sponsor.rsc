A Partnership-Driven Brokerage Model

 GTCFX has built its business around long-term collaboration, offering multi-tier partnership models, flexible rebate structures, and regional business support that enable partners to scale with confidence.
This partnership-first strategy has helped GTCFX grow to nearly one million clients worldwide, supported by strong regulatory governance and a clear commitment to transparency and trust.
Institutional-Grade Liquidity Designed for Scale

The brokerage provides:
• Deep global liquidity pools

Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
