4:Td6b,Bitcoin spirals toward $60,000, heading to worst one-day drawdown since FTX blowup One analyst points to the 200-day moving average — currently around $58,000 to $60,000 — as a potential support level to watch. Updated Feb 5, 2026, 8:51 p.m. Published Feb 5, 2026, 8:00 p.m. Bitcoin BTC $69,746.73 tumbled to $63,000 during early afternoon U.S. hours as this week's crypto selloff accelerated into a bloodbath on Thursday. The largest cryptocurrency fell more than 10% over the past 24 hours to a session low a few dollars above $63,000, according to CoinDesk data , the weakest level since October 2024 and below the 2021 peak. It's now lower by 50% from its record high just above $126,000 hit in early October. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Feb. 5 could be one of the worst days in bitcoin's history. BTC is on track to suffer its steepe one-day drawdown — 10.5% since midnight UTC at current prices — since Nov. 8, 2022, when the collapse of crypto exchange FTX sent BTC below $16,000 after a 14.3% drop on the day. Crypto wasn't the only asset class under relentless selling pressure. Silver also plunged 14% during the day, and is now almost 40% below its record high just a week ago. Gold also fell more than 2% to $4,850, but that selloff wasn't as bad as silver. The precious metal is now trading about 15% below its record last week. Software stocks, often moving in lockstep with bitcoin, continued to selloff, with the thematic iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) declining more than 3% and down 24% year to date. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were also 1% lower. Crypto stocks weren't spared either. Coinbase (COIN), Galaxy (GLXY), Strategy MSTR) and BitMine (BMNR) tumbled more than 10%, while several crypto miners, including Bitfarms (BITF), CleanSpark (CLSK), Hut 8 (HUT), and Mara (MARA), saw similar losses. "One big factor is just very thin liquidity,” said Adrian Fritz, chief investment strategist at 21shares. "If there is a bit of a sell pressure, it usually triggers a lot of liquidations.” In a fragile market environment with only a few buy and sell orders to cushion trades, even modest sell-offs can trigger a large price reaction, in turn triggering further liquidations. While some have said the worst is over for weeks now, Fritz believes otherwise. “There's still no signal that we bottomed out. I think it's too early. There's no confirmed turnaround,” he said. He points to the 200-moving-day average — currently around $58,000 to $60,000 — as a key support level to watch. That level also aligns with bitcoin's "realized price," or the average cost basis of all bitcoin holders, which he believes could serve as a strong, multi-year support.

Almost all CoinDesk index prices , including major tokens and memecoins, are down by more than 10% over the last 24 hours. Crypto price as of 6:29 pm UTC (CoinDesk data) XRP, which fell 19% over the same 24-hour period, underperformed most other large-cap cryptos. While Fritz said he believes there's no specific trigger that puts extra pressure on the token, he said that "from a technical point of view, there's not a lot of support levels for XRP."
