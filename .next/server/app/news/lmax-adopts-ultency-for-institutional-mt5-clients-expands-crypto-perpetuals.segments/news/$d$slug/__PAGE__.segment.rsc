4:Td88,LMAX Group
has integrated MetaQuotes' Ultency Matching Engine into its trading
infrastructure, giving institutional clients faster execution and tighter
connectivity across its MetaTrader 5 offering.
The
London-based cross-asset exchange handles over $40 billion in daily spot FX and
digital asset flow. Brokers accessing that liquidity through MT5 will now route
orders through Ultency, MetaQuotes' low-latency aggregation and matching
system.
LMAX also
expanded its digital asset derivatives in recent months, and the Ultency
integration arrives as the firm adds 19 new tokens to its perpetual futures
lineup. The exchange initially launched 100x
leverage crypto perpetuals in September targeting institutional demand for leveraged digital
asset exposure.
“Integrating
MetaQuotes' Ultency Matching Engine enhances the existing seamless
functionality our broker and institutional clients expect across our trading
venues,” said Jenna Wright, Managing Director of Digital Assets at LMAX
Group.
[#highlighted-links#] 
“It
strengthens execution quality, improves performance and enables clients to
trade effortlessly across the full suite of LMAX products, including our
expanding range of perpetual futures, offering a substantial market opportunity
for institutions,” she explained.
Execution Speed Becomes
Competitive Factor
Ultency
functions as a built-in matching engine within MetaTrader 5, eliminating the
need for brokers to maintain separate liquidity bridges. MetaQuotes
introduced Ultency at
FMLS:25, positioning it as an alternative to third-party bridge providers that
have historically connected MT5 brokers to external liquidity sources.
Order
processing speed matters for firms trading perpetual futures, where funding
rates reset every eight hours and price movements can trigger rapid position
adjustments. LMAX clients trading through MT5 will route executions through
Ultency's aggregation layer rather than external middleware.
“Their
reputation for delivering transparent, high‑performance liquidity aligns
perfectly with our commitment to advancing institutional‑grade trading
technology,” Renat Fatkhullin, CEO of MetaQuotes, added. “This
integration enables MT5 participants to access faster execution, deeper
liquidity and greater operational resilience.”
Perpetual Futures Offering
Expands
LMAX also
has added Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, Solana, TRON, Dogecoin, Cardano,
Uniswap, Chainlink, Aave, Aptos, BNB, Toncoin, Sui, Avalanche, Polkadot,
Internet Computer, Hedera, and Near to its perpetual futures contracts. The
exchange started with Bitcoin and Ethereum pairs when it entered the perpetuals
market last September.
GMG Prime
adopted Ultency in
January to connect institutional liquidity to MT5, becoming one of the first
liquidity providers to implement MetaQuotes' matching technology. LMAX follows
a similar path, though it operates regulated execution venues rather than
serving purely as a liquidity provider.
The firm's
infrastructure includes FCA and CySEC-regulated brokers, an FCA-regulated
multilateral trading facility, and a Gibraltar-licensed digital asset venue.
LMAX secured 150
million dollars from Ripple in January to support RLUSD stablecoin trading and cross-asset CFD
products.
LMAX
operates matching centers in London, New York, Tokyo, and Singapore, serving
funds, banks, and brokerages in more than 100 countries.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
