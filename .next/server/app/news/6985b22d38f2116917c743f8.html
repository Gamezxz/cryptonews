In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

a contracts for differences (CFD) broker focused on emerging markets, has entered motor racing, but not through the usual Formula 1 deals. Instead, it has become a multi-year sponsor of the Prima Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team.\nIs MotoGP Going to Be the Next F1 for CFD Brokers?\nAlthough a handful of other retail brokers have marketed their brands around top two-wheeler racing, it has yet to become mainstream like Formula 1. This also suggests that brokers can secure MotoGP sponsorship deals at a much lower cost than Formula 1 ones.\nAlthough none of the Formula One teams or the brokers have officially revealed the financial terms of their deals, Libertex’s Chief Marketing Officer, Marios Chailis, said that the lowest-tier F1 sponsorship deal costs about $5 million.\nRead more: “Official Fintech Partner” - FX Firms Found Value in Sports Beyond Just Branding\n“Partnering with Prima Pramac Yamaha allows us to connect our brand with a sport that reflects how modern trading works: fast-moving, data-driven, and powered by innovation,” said Tien Ching, CEO of ACCM, in a statement. This also highlights how the target customers of CFD brokers often align with motor racing fans.\nGetting Exposure Is the Goal\nACCM operates under regulatory licences in Australia and South Africa, along with offshore licences in Seychelles and Vanuatu. According to SimilarWeb data, most of the brokerage’s website traffic comes from Vietnam and Thailand.\nThe latest sponsorship deal has made the broker the MotoGP team’s “Official Partner”, allowing it to place its branding across team assets and digital platforms. The broker will also gain access to a “range of other significant rights”.\nThe Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team also has a large social media following, with 560,000 followers on Instagram and another 560,000 on Facebook, meaning any promotion of the broker would reach a wide audience worldwide.\nIn addition, sponsor brands can gain visibility on MotoGP’s wider channels if placed well. These channels have more than 17.9 million followers on Instagram and over 7 million subscribers on YouTube.\nWhile football and Formula 1 remain the top sports marketing choices for CFD brokers, many are now turning to niche local sports to better target their key markets. The number of broker deals with individuals and teams in mixed martial arts, cricket, rugby, and other niche sports continues to grow.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

While BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced a record trading volume of $10 billion alongside a 13% price drop, analysts are divided about whether the market has reached its bottom. Chris Burniske expects further downside to levels around $58K or $50K, while Bitfinex analysts suggest that without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any upward movement might only represent a lower high in a fragile market.12:Taef,กองทุน Bitcoin ETF ในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้แสดงความยืดหยุ่นอย่างน่าทึ่งแม้ในช่วงที่ราคา Bitcoin ลดลงกว่า 50% ตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2025 ตามที่ Eric Balchunas นักวิเคราะห์ ETF จาก Bloomberg ระบุ ปริมาณ Bitcoin ที่ถือโดยกองทุนเหล่านี้ลดลงเพียงประมาณ 7% เท่านั้น จาก 1.362 ล้านเหรียญเป็น 1.272 ล้านเหรียญ การถือครอง Bitcoin ETF ทั่วโลกก็แสดงความแข็งแกร่งในทำนองเดียวกัน โดยลดลงเพียง 4.8% จาก 1.50 ล้านเป็น 1.428 ล้านเหรียญ ซึ่งชี้ให้เห็นว่านักลงทุน ส่วนใหญ่เป็น \"ผู้สูงอายุ\" ยังคงถือหุ้นอย่างมั่นคงแม้ในช่วงที่ตลาดผันผวน\n\nBitcoin เพิ่งลดลงสู่ระดับ $60K เป็นครั้งแรกนับตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2024 แม้ว่าจะฟื้นตัวกลับมาเล็กน้อยสู่ระดับ $65K ในขณะที่เขียนข่าว แม้ว่ากองทุน Bitcoin ETF ของ BlackRock จะมีมูลค่าการซื้อขายสูงสุดในรอบวันที่ $10 พันล้าน พร้อมกับการลดราคา 13% นักวิเคราะห์ยังคงแบ่งความเห็นเกี่ยวกับว่าตลาดได้ผ่านจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือไม่ Chris Burniske คาดการณ์ว่าจะมีการปรับตัวลดลงต่อไปยังระดับประมาณ $58K หรือ $50K ในขณะที่นักวิเคราะห์จาก Bitfinex ชี้ให้เห็นว่าหากไม่มีความต้องการในการซื้อขายและกระแสเงินทุนจากกองทุน ETF ที่แข็งแกร่งขึ้น การเคลื่อนไหวขาขึ้นใดๆ อาจเป็นเพียงจุดสูงสุดที่ต่ำกว่าในตลาดที่อ่อนแอ13:Tb48,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively resilient despite the crypto asset’s +50% price decline. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the overall BTC held by the ETFs dropped by only about 7%. He viewed the holders, mainly boomers, as ‘diamond hands.’ “Bitcoin’s price is down 44% from October high, but the amount of BTC held by the ETFs is only down 6.6%. Boomer strong.” Source: X Before the October crash, the U.S spot BTC ETFs held a record high of 1.362 million BTC. This stash had since dropped to 1.272 million BTC by the 4th of February. Can ETFs withstand the pressure? When zoomed out to the global holdings of BTC ETFs (covering offerings in the U.S, E.U., Asia, and others), the same picture emerged. Over the same period, global BTC ETF holdings dropped by only 72,400 BTC from October’s high of 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC. That’s only a 4.8% drop in BTC holdings. Source: BOLD report Put differently, the market fears and outflows in the past few weeks have not led to a massive drop in BTC held by ETFs. However, the asset extended its price decline over the past 24 hours, tagging $60K for the first time since October 2024. Although BTC price had moved up slightly to $65K at press time, there was still uncertainty about whether it had reached its final market bottom. Source: Bloomberg That said, the latest dump saw BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) post its record daily trading volume of $10 billion and its second-worst price drop 13%. For Balchunas , this was ‘brutal,’ further raising questions about the ETF buyers’ ability to remain resilient if markets go lower. Is $60K the market bottom? Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a VC partner at Placeholder and former Ark Invest crypto lead, said the sub-$60K levels were of ‘interest’ but expected an extra downside. “Watching with interest, but not buying yet. Expect a bounce, but doubt the bloodletting is done.” Chris nailed the October market top and the ensuing drawdown. He had projected that the market could bottom near $58K or $50K (levels that aligned with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and on-chain cost basis. For their part, Bitfinex analysts appeared hopeful that the market was not in a better position to form a bottom after the price dropped below the previous cycle peak of $69K. But they also echoed Burniske’s caution, “Order books show most demand under $66k as support bids were hit or pulled. That can set up a relief bounce, but without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any move risks being just a lower high in a fragile market.” Source: Bitfinex Final Thoughts BTC held by U.S spot ETFs has dropped by only 7% despite BTC’s +50% price decline since October 2025 Despite the extended dip to $60K-$65K zone, analysts appeared cautiously optimistic for a potential BTC bottom."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:Tc01,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"In brief Polymarket has filed U.S. trademark applications for POLY and $POLY tied to digital token and crypto trading services. Executives previously confirmed plans to Decrypt for a POLY token and a possible airdrop focused on “true utility.” The move comes as Polymarket faces fresh legal challenges, with traders seeing low odds of a token launch before May. Polymarket has filed trademark applications for \" POLY \" and \" $POLY \" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, signaling concrete steps toward launching its long-anticipated native token , even as the prediction market faces mounting regulatory challenges. The filings, submitted Thursday by Polymarket's parent company Blockratize Inc., cover trademark protection for “cryptocurrency services, financial trading platforms, and blockchain-based payment systems.” Both applications describe services for \"providing a digital currency or digital token for use by members of an on-line community via a global computer network\" and list cryptocurrency trading, financial exchange services, and portfolio management among their intended uses. Polymarket’s token plans The trademark applications offer the first formal public paper trail tied to Polymarket’s token plans. Polymarket CMO Matthew Modabber confirmed plans for a POLY token and airdrop in October, telling Degenz Live, a show from Decrypt's sister company, Rug Radio, that the company wants the token to have \"true utility\" and \"longevity.\" CEO Shayne Coplan teased the token in October by tweeting a \"POLY\" ticker alongside Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and BNB . Sources familiar with the matter previously told Decrypt that Polymarket does not plan to launch its token until it has regained a foothold in the U.S. market. The company moved closer to that goal in November, when it received CFTC approval to operate domestically, nearly four years after paying a $1.4 million fine and exiting the U.S. market. On prediction market Myriad , owned by Decrypt ’s parent company Dastan, users place just a 30% chance on Polymarket announcing its token before May. Prediction markets face challenges The trademark filings come at a critical juncture for Polymarket as it treads through U.S. market reentry while facing state-level legal challenges that threaten its core business model. But the path forward has grown more complicated as, most recently, the Nevada state court issued a temporary restraining order blocking Polymarket from offering event-based contracts in the state, finding its activities likely violate Nevada gaming law. The platform subsequently removed the case to federal court, claiming the state action conflicts with federal law, according to Daniel Wallach, founder and principal of Wallach Legal LLC, a law firm specializing in sports wagering and gaming law. The trademark applications await examination by the USPTO. Polymarket did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
