4:Ta8a,Startale Group and SBI Holdings have launched a
blockchain that provides exchange infrastructure for tokenized
securities and real-world asset (RWA) trading in Asia. 
Dubbed Strium, the new platform is built to support
trading and settlement of tokenized equities and RWA-linked instruments in both
spot and derivatives markets. 
It plans to operate 24/7 and focuses on
securities-linked products rather than crypto-native perpetual contracts. Strium
also separates its exchange architecture from direct asset issuance or custody
to stay compatible with existing financial systems.
Exchange Layer for Tokenized Securities
The venture builds on a partnership between Startale
and SBI last year that targeted the growing market for tokenized assets and
onchain capital markets. With Strium, the partners aim to position the network
as a core exchange layer for Asia’s onchain securities market.
“Building on the August 2025 partnership announcement,
which positioned the alliance at the forefront of the $18.9 trillion tokenized
asset market opportunity, Strium addresses a fundamental shift now
underway in institutional and professional markets,” Startale announced.

The launch of the Strium brand comes alongside proofs
of concept that test the network’s exchange architecture, settlement efficiency
and interoperability. The PoC work focuses on performance under high-load
conditions and connectivity with traditional financial infrastructure and other
blockchain networks.
The two firms earlier collaborated to develop a fully
regulated yen‑denominated stablecoin aimed at global settlement use. The
project seeks to merge traditional financial infrastructure with
blockchain‑based payment systems.

It includes the creation of a tokenized yen
tailored for enterprise applications and cross‑border transactions. The
initiative aligns with Japan’s push for digital currency frameworks.
SBI Steps Up US Push
SBI recently acquired a minority stake in US brokerage Clear Street through its American subsidiary, SBI Holdings USA, in a $50
million deal. The investment represents less than 1% of the New
York-based firm, which is preparing for an initial public offering on Nasdaq.
Alongside the capital injection, SBI and Clear Street
agreed to pursue a partnership that will establish a joint venture in Japan.
The new entity will initially concentrate on asset management services, with
plans to expand into equities trading, prime brokerage, and digital
asset-related businesses as the collaboration evolves.
