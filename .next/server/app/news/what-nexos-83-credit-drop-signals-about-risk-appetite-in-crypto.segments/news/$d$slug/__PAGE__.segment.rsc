4:T43b,NEXO's retail credit data from 2025 through early 2026 reveals a distinct cycle of aggressive leverage followed by deleveraging, mirroring broader risk appetite shifts in the crypto market. After peaking at $136.63 million in January 2025, credit withdrawals plummeted to $22.04 million by November as volatility and stalled upside forced traders to reduce risk. This trend was paralleled by Ethereum borrowing on Aave, which surged to 1.2 million ETH at mid-2025 before collapsing to near 300,000 ETH by early 2026, signaling a widespread liquidity reset.

Although credit flows stabilized at historically low levels around $24 million in late 2025 and early 2026, suggesting a potential bottoming of demand, NEXO's price action remains bearish. The token has broken below key support levels at $0.901 and $0.947, currently trading near $0.73 with technical indicators like the RSI showing persistent weakness. This divergence indicates that while excess leverage is being cleared, market sentiment remains risk-off, requiring a significant price reclaim to stabilize the downtrend.5:Tb62,ข้อมูลการถอนเครดิตปลีกของ NEXO ตั้งแต่ปี 2025 ถึงต้นปี 2026 เผยให้เห็นวงจรของการใช้เลเวอเรจอย่างก้าวร้าวตามด้วยการลดขนาดพอร์ต (Deleveraging) ซึ่งสะท้อนการเปลี่ยนแปลงของความอยากรับความเสี่ยงในตลาดคริปโต หลังจากพุ่งขึ้นสูงสุดที่ 136.63 ล้านดอลลาร์ในเดือนมกราคม 2025 การถอนเครดิตตกต่ำเหลือเพียง 22.04 ล้านดอลลาร์ในเดือนพฤศจิกายน เมื่อความผันผวนและการขาดแรงขับเคลื่อนของราคาบังคับให้นักเทรดลดความเสี่ยง แนวโน้มนี้สอดคล้องกับการยืม Ethereum บน Aave ที่พุ่งถึง 1.2 ล้าน ETH กลางปี 2025 ก่อนจะดิ่งลงเหลือเพียง 300,000 ETH ในต้นปี 2026 ซึ่งส่งสัญญาณการปรับฐานสภาพคล่องอย่างกว้างขวาง

แม้ว่าการไหลเวียนของเครดิตจะเริ่มมั่นคงที่ระดับต่ำประมาณ 24 ล้านดอลลาร์ในช่วงปลายปี 2025 ถึงต้นปี 2026 ซึ่งบ่งชี้ว่าความต้องการอาจอยู่ในช่วงจุดต่ำสุด แต่ราคาของ NEXO ยังคงมีทิศทางลง (Bearish) เหรียญดังกล่าวหลุดจากแนวรับสำคัญที่ $0.901 และ $0.947 และปัจจุบันอยู่ที่ระดับ $0.73 พร้อมด้วยตัวชี้วัดทางเทคนิคอย่าง RSI ที่ยังแสดงความอ่อนแอ ความแตกต่างนี้บ่งชี้ว่าแม้จะมีการลดภาระเลเวอเรจออกไปแล้ว แต่บรรยากาศตลาดโดยรวมยังคงเลี่ยงความเสี่ยง (Risk-off) และจำเป็นต้องมีการดึงราคากลับขึ้นมาสูงกว่าจุดสำคัญเพื่อเสถียรภาพแนวโน้มลดลง6:Td6a,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 Retail credit withdrawals on NEXO [NEXO] opened in January 2025 at an elevated $136.63 million. This reflected aggressive leverage deployment during strong market conditions. As volatility rose, withdrawals fell to $85.3 million in February and $54.4 million in March, signaling forced balance-sheet tightening rather than organic demand cooling. This early deleveraging implied that retail participants began reducing risk as liquidity conditions shifted. Activity was then rebuilt. April climbed to $75.2 million, followed by $79.8 million in May and a local peak at $95.8 million in June, while MoM turned positive. This rebound suggested traders re-engaged leverage into recovering price momentum, using credit to re-enter risk assets. Source: CryptoQuant/ X However, the second half showed structural fatigue. Withdrawals fell to $67 million in July, hovered at $70 million in August, then slid to $48.5 million in September as market upside stalled. The decline later accelerated to $22.04 million by November, reflecting risk aversion, thinner liquidity, and reduced speculative appetite. This sustained deleveraging implied balance sheet resets while excess leverage cleared, and marginal buyers retreated. Withdrawals stabilize in December 2025 and January 2026 at $23.957 million and $23.965 million, respectively, holding close to their lowest levels. That flattening suggests credit demand may be bottoming, often a precursor to gradual market reaccumulation once confidence rebuilds. Credit growth meets liquidity stress Ethereum[ETH] borrowing on Aave [AAVE] began in 2024, subdued near 150,000 to 200,000 ETH , with rates around 2.5–3% amid stabilizing markets. Demand built steadily, reaching 400,000 ETH by October 2024 as traders increased leveraged positioning. Momentum accelerated into early 2025; utilization approached 800,000 ETH while rates spiked near 3.5%. Source: CryptoQuant/ X This signaled crowded leverage and rising collateral demand during strengthening ETH price trends. Borrowing peaked in mid-2025 near 1.2 million Ethereum [ETH], marking maximum speculative exposure. Thereafter, borrowing fell toward 600,000 ETH as deleveraging pressures emerged. By early 2026, utilization neared 300,000 ETH, and rates eased toward 1.5–2%, reflecting cooling risk appetite and leverage reset. Key support failure extends NEXO’s downtrend NEXO extended its downtrend as the price slipped below the $0.901 and $0.947 resistance bands, reinforcing the bearish structure. Selling pressure accelerated, driving the price into the $0.80 demand zone, where support briefly emerged. However, momentum weakened further as candles pierced the zone, pushing the price toward $0.73. Source: TradingView Moving averages trended downward and compressed above price, signaling sustained downside control. RSI hovered near 26, reflecting oversold conditions and weak reversal strength. This alignment showed persistent distribution rather than capitulation. As the breakdown structure held, market sentiment tilted risk-off, with bulls requiring a reclaim above $0.90 to stabilize the near-term price structure. Final Thoughts Leverage expanded sharply across credit markets before compressing, signaling a broad liquidity reset as risk appetite weakened. Credit flows stabilized, yet NEXO price continued falling, showing market sentiment remained risk-off despite leverage cooling.0:{"buildId":"J-5ZVPn6A93od_1TUxTCt","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853abb38f2116917acb68a","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=567867","__v":0,"author":"Muriuki Lazaro","categories":["defi"],"category":"defi","content":"Credit contraction deepens across Nexo and Aave as speculative positioning unwinds.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:03.934Z","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lazaro-68.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:03.934Z","link":"https://ambcrypto.com/what-nexos-83-credit-drop-signals-about-risk-appetite-in-crypto/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T00:30:57.000Z","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"NEXO ยอดสินเชื่อลด 83% สะท้อนความอยากเสี่ยงในตลาดคริปโตที่ซบเซา การเก็บกำไรและการปรับสถานะเชิง speculative ทำให้แพลตฟอร์มประกันสินเชื่อ Aave ก็ประสบการหดตัวเช่นกัน","title":"What NEXO’s 83% credit drop signals about risk appetite in crypto","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T15:00:35.854Z","translatedTitle":"สิ่งที่การลดลง 83% ของเครดิต NEXO ส่งสัญญาณเกี่ยวกับความอยากรับความเสี่ยงในตลาดคริปโต","slug":"what-nexos-83-credit-drop-signals-about-risk-appetite-in-crypto","aiSummary":"$4","aiSummaryThai":"$5","fullContent":"$6","keyPoints":["NEXO retail credit withdrawals dropped by 83% from January 2025 to November 2025, signaling a shift from aggressive leverage to risk aversion due to stalled market upside.","Ethereum borrowing on Aave peaked at 1.2 million ETH in mid-2025 before deleveraging to ~300,000 ETH by early 2026, reflecting a broader liquidity reset.","Credit demand stabilized at low levels in early 2026, but NEXO price remains bearish after breaking below $0.901 support, indicating persistent risk-off sentiment."],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":474},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69865fc238f2116917d3abb9","category":"defi","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:36:40.000Z","slug":"inside-defi-003-insidedefi-003-crypto-in-crisis-defi-doomerism","source":"Protos","title":"Inside DeFi 003: 🛸 InsideDeFi 003: Crypto in crisis, DeFi doomerism","translatedTitle":"Inside DeFi 003: 🛸 InsideDeFi 003: Crypto อยู่ในวิกฤต, DeFi doomerism"},{"_id":"698658b738f2116917d34770","category":"defi","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:02:13.000Z","slug":"ripple-integrating-hyperliquid-into-its-prime-brokerage-platform-to-broaden-inst","source":"ZyCrypto","title":"Ripple Integrating Hyperliquid Into Its Prime Brokerage Platform To Broaden Institutional DeFi Access Fails To Bump XRP Bulls","translatedTitle":"Ripple ผนวก Hyperliquid เข้ากับแพลตฟอร์ม Prime Brokerage เพื่อขยายการเข้าถึง DeFi สำหรับสถาบัน แต่ก็ไม่สามารถกระตุ้น XRP ขึ้นได้"},{"_id":"698650a74007f0a6ec7f68b7","slug":"bitcoin-slips-deeper-into-bear-territory-cryptoquant-analysis-shows","title":"Bitcoin Slips Deeper Into Bear Territory, Cryptoquant Analysis Shows","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:30:37.000Z","source":"Bitcoin.com","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin ถอยลงลึกเข้าสู่ Bear Territory ตามการวิเคราะห์ของ Cryptoquant"},{"_id":"69853ade38f2116917acbabc","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:07:13.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","title":"Here’s what happened in crypto today","translatedTitle":"นี่คือสิ่งที่เกิดขึ้นในวงการ crypto วันนี้","slug":"heres-what-happened-in-crypto-today"}]}],"$L7"],["$L8"],"$L9"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
