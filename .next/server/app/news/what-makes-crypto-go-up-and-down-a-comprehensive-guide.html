If you’re new, you may be asking yourself, “What makes crypto prices go up and down?” What exactly affects crypto prices to make them notoriously volatile, increasing or decreasing in price daily? The truth is that there are identifiable factors that explain the factors influencing the value of cryptocurrencies. This article describes “why does crypto go up and down,” what drives the fluctuations, and how prices are determined. What Makes Crypto Go Up and Down? Unlike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies primarily serve as fully digitalized and decentralized currencies without backing from central authorities or governments. As they take the financial world by storm, many investors jumping onto the bandwagon ask, “How does crypto have value?” That’s because crypto market volatility is a double-edged sword, with prices soaring and plummeting without notice. So what exactly causes cryptocurrencies to rise and fall? First is the appeal of a non-government-controlled currency that separates them from the reliance and control of centralized authorities. This disintermediation deprives crypto assets of the stability that dependence on a central authority gives traditional fiat currencies. In the absence of this governmental backing, cryptocurrencies do not trade in the traditional, more stable manner of fiat currencies. Maybe you’re wondering “why is crypto going up” all of a sudden and down the next moment. The answer could lie in the presence of whales, referring to large investors holding significant amounts of a cryptocurrency. Whales have the power to affect market manipulation by selling or buying large quantities of crypto at once. Such actions can cause the price of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to crash or spike. Market manipulation is illegal in traditional finance, but is difficult to detect or regulate in the crypto market. Lastly, many other factors can explain the fluctuations in crypto prices. They range from macroeconomic factors, supply and demand, technical analysis, and market sentiment. Moreover, the fact that most commercial entities don’t yet accept cryptocurrencies makes them more like speculative assets than fiat currencies. By understanding the factors that drive crypto value, investors can navigate the ups and downs and be prepared for volatility. What affects the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Several factors cause cryptocurrencies to rise and fall. Whether it’s economic events, wars, fluctuations in bond and stock markets, or many others, they all have an effect. Unlike fiat currencies whose value is influenced by the government’s monetary policies, cryptocurrencies are fully decentralized. This means the value depends on how much investors are willing to pay. Among the most prominent factors affecting crypto prices are the following: 1. Supply and Demand Supply and demand are essential bases in determining the price of cryptocurrencies. The value of assets like Bitcoin with a maximum supply increases as demand rises. The hard cap of 21 million coins creates scarcity, giving investors the confidence that promotes ongoing demand. On the other hand, an increase in market supply can suppress prices, which dilute the value of a token. 2. Market Sentiment Individuals generally assign value to a product or service based on the item’s market perception. In most cases, the value of an item increases whenever more people are willing to pay its price. For example, the cost of Bitcoin rose to its all-time high of $65K in 2021 following the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. On the flipside, the value of cryptocurrency can go down whenever it loses a positive perception due to adverse events. This can range from unethical behavior from their leaders, bad publicity, or security breaches. 3. Utility Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, utility means the real-world practical application or functionality of a digital asset. Cryptocurrencies with practical use cases always attract more investors and users, thereby increasing their demand and value. For example, an increase in demand and reduced circulation can lead to higher prices. A cryptocurrency with greater utility makes the network more secure and robust, attracts more participants, and increases demand for the token. 4. Competition As of 2025, there are between 17,000 and 24,000 different types of cryptocurrencies promising different technological advancements and use cases. Leading projects face rival platforms offering lower fees, more scalability, and increased use cases. The ongoing rapid evolution and an influx of new coins keep the cryptocurrency ecosystem healthy, but bring additional volatility. 5. Tokenomics The tokenomics of a cryptocurrency can influence its value based on the supply and demand dynamics. Some important factors include the token’s utility, scarcity, burning mechanism, and distribution model. The side mechanics of a token, such as token burns or limited maximum supply, have the potential to create scarcity and boost the price. However, effective distribution strategies and strong utility can drive its demand and create long-term value. 6. Governance and Regulations Regulation is one of the key factors affecting the present value and future of a cryptocurrency. Developments like legalizing crypto trade or governments offering regulatory clarity can instill investor confidence and price gains. On the other hand, announcements about harsh restrictions and bans can curtail demand and quickly lead to a selloff. Policy shifts keep investors on edge, causing prices to react downwards or upwards based on rumors or updates from lawmakers. 7. Liquidity Liquidity influences investor behavior, price stability, and trading efficiency, and can impact crypto prices. High liquidity facilitates fast, stable, and cost-effective trading while low liquidity causes slippage, higher costs, and greater volatility. Factors associated with liquidity, like market depth, trade volume, and market makers, play a role in ensuring market stability or its absence. How Does Cryptocurrency Gain or Lose Value? The fundamental economic principle of supply and demand explains how cryptocurrency gains or loses value. The price increases whenever demand for a cryptocurrency exceeds its supply. On the other hand, a cryptocurrency loses value during times of high supply and low demand. Other factors that can influence crypto prices include positive or negative media coverage, fraud, security breaches, and regulatory actions. How does crypto make money? Cryptocurrency can generate returns by selling or buying crypto and making a profit from price increases through supply and demand. However, there are other methods, including: Investing: Buy and hold onto a crypto asset, hoping the value will increase over time. Passive Income Streams such as: Staking : Staking or locking up a cryptocurrency to secure a blockchain network and earn rewards. Lending : Lend your idle crypto assets via a DeFi platform and earn interest Mining: Use computers to mine crypto by solving mathematical puzzles to verify blockchain transactions and get rewarded with newly minted coins. Yield Farming: Offer liquidity to DeFi platforms and earn rewards and fees. Affiliate Programs: Earn commissions by referring new users to crypto exchanges and platforms. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs): Investing in new cryptocurrency projects before they become widely available and get high returns if they succeed. Airdrops : Receive free tokens to promote a crypto project’s platform. What causes cryptocurrency to fail? Several factors can cause cryptocurrency to fail, including: Regulatory crackdowns : Whenever governments ban trading or implement increased oversight, it can sap market confidence. Also, when exchanges are shut down or a cryptocurrency is classified as illegal. The same applies to security issues, exchange breaches, high-profile hacks, and a blockchain’s security flaws leading to eroded trust. Market sentiment shifts : Critical comments from mainstream media, influential figures, or warnings from regulators that create widespread fear and panic selling. Supply surges: Releasing a large amount of tokens for project rewards or early investor selloffs can be detrimental. This can make the market unable to absorb the supply and lead to price drops. Technological Failures: Failed upgrades, poor scalability, slow transaction speeds, and bugs can undermine a token’s reputation and cause investors to lose confidence. Can Cryptocurrencies Be Overbought or Oversold? Overbought and oversold are extreme crypto market conditions that occur under different circumstances and impact future price movements. The truth is that just like traditional assets, cryptocurrencies can be oversold or overbought. Overbought : This is a scenario where a cryptocurrency is bought aggressively over a short period. The result is pushing the price to an unsustainable level. The situation is caused chiefly by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and leads to inflated prices. Oversold : This refers to when an asset is sold aggressively and drives the price below its market value. The phenomenon is mainly caused by panic selling. How accurate are cryptocurrency price predictions? The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable, making accurately predicting the future performance of an asset rather difficult. Factors like technological advancement, regulatory changes, or social media trends can have a significant impact on their value. As a result, making accurate price predictions in this dynamic environment is a tricky balancing act. The accuracy of crypto price predictions can vary widely based on the economic theory used, research, and analysis. It is worth noting that in some cases, predictions rely on personal biases and speculation. While evaluating the credibility of the methodology and resources used, remember that even the most accurate price prediction can fail. As the cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, unforeseen circumstances and new developments could disrupt the most well-founded predictions. You must understand the risks and limitations associated with price predictions to make informed investment decisions. It’s also essential to remain updated and adaptable with a critical mindset as you’re dealing with speculative assets. How market cycles affect cryptocurrency prices Different cryptocurrency market cycles drive the process through at least four phases, namely Accumulation, Markup, Distribution, and Markdown. The four phases of the cryptocurrency market cycle are: Accumulation : After a significant price drop, savvy investors buy and wait for the next uptrend. Markup: Price rise as more investors join the market with the growing optimism and positive news leading to bull runs. Distribution: Early investors sell during the peak, take profits, and cause a price fluctuation. This phase comes just before a downturn as sellers outnumber buyers. Markdown: The negative sentiment spreads and causes panic selling, leading to a bear market. Some of the key factors influencing crypto market cycles include macroeconomic factors, investor sentiment, and supply and demand dynamics. The recurring shifts can cause price surges during bullish markets or downturns when sentiment changes and investors panic. Tips for Beginner Investors to Predict Crypto Price Movements Predicting the price movements of cryptocurrencies can be a challenge, especially for new investors. Price fluctuations are swift and unpredictable, and can lead to potential profits or losses overnight. Having insights on what to look for is essential to invest in crypto effectively. Analyze Market Trends: Your first step is to carefully analyze historical price charts and identify short-term, mid-term, and long-term trends. Locate existing patterns and potential turning points that could predict future price movements. You can use technical analysis and tools like the Relative Strength Index and Moving Averages. You can also analyze Moving Average Convergence Divergence to predict future price directions. Sentiment Analysis: You can predict potential price movements through news outlets, social media, and other related forums. You may derive insights from trending news and community thoughts within crypto communities. Stay updated on technological breakthroughs, trend-setting announcements, and word from influential crypto personalities. Fundamental Analysis: Cryptocurrencies don’t have intrinsic value based on earnings and dividends like traditional assets. Key factors in the basic analysis within the crypto space depend on team composition, technology, adoption rates, and network strength. Read project whitepapers and consider their utility, scalability, and partnerships or market trends to evaluate their future potential. Quantitative Analysis: There are quantitative methods that use mathematical models and statistical data to predict future crypto prices. Use quantitative analysis tools and create algorithms to identify patterns that indicate probable predictions based on trade volumes and historical data. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming increasingly popular for quantitative analysis. External Factors and News: Stay updated on external news events, such as geopolitical events and regulatory developments that can impact cryptocurrency prices. Stay abreast with news, legal announcements, and significant updates within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion Understanding “why is crypto going up” or down is essential in helping you make informed investment choices. Due to the unique characteristics of crypto assets, they are notoriously volatile and can be subject to market manipulation. The key factors affecting the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are supply and demand, as well as other market dynamics. Users, especially new ones, must endeavor to conduct proper research on “how crypto has value before investing their cash. Alternatively, you can follow the advice of a qualified expert to stay ahead of the curve in this unpredictable market. As the crypto asset market continues to evolve, staying adaptable is the best way to remain abreast with crypto prices. FAQs The three key factors that drive the rise and fall of crypto are supply &amp; demand, competition, and market perception. Most crypto assets implement mechanisms that limit their circulating supply to prevent inflation. Market perception closely affects market value, meaning the higher the perception, the greater the asset’s value. Several factors, like economic conditions, company news, and network factors, are primarily responsible for the price swings. Understanding what drives crypto price variations is essential before you consider investing. The limited supply of some cryptocurrencies creates a condition where an increase in demand puts upward pressure on price. Bitcoin, with its maximum supply cap of 21 million coins, is the perfect example. Studies have also shown that investors mostly turn to cryptocurrencies during uncertain times, while some news headlines also impact the market. The price of Bitcoin changes because of its scarcity, market demand, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the cost associated with producing Bitcoin through mining can also influence its price. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, there’s no physical asset or government policy that backs Bitcoin. Instead, BTC is supported by a new system using incentives, decentralization, cryptography, and energy. Yes, other financial markets can affect the value of cryptocurrency. However, the degree of the correlation and effects can vary over time based on the particular cryptocurrency. Factors like economic health, fiat currency exchange rates, interest rates, and stock market prices are correlated with crypto prices.</p></div></section><div class="article-source-link"><a

price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appears unpredictable and mysterious, especially for beginners. If you’re new, you may be asking yourself, “What makes crypto prices go up and down?” What exactly affects crypto prices to make them notoriously volatile, increasing or decreasing in price daily? The truth is that there are identifiable factors that explain the factors influencing the value of cryptocurrencies. This article describes “why does crypto go up and down,” what drives the fluctuations, and how prices are determined. What Makes Crypto Go Up and Down? Unlike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies primarily serve as fully digitalized and decentralized currencies without backing from central authorities or governments. As they take the financial world by storm, many investors jumping onto the bandwagon ask, “How does crypto have value?” That’s because crypto market volatility is a double-edged sword, with prices soaring and plummeting without notice. So what exactly causes cryptocurrencies to rise and fall? First is the appeal of a non-government-controlled currency that separates them from the reliance and control of centralized authorities. This disintermediation deprives crypto assets of the stability that dependence on a central authority gives traditional fiat currencies. In the absence of this governmental backing, cryptocurrencies do not trade in the traditional, more stable manner of fiat currencies. Maybe you’re wondering “why is crypto going up” all of a sudden and down the next moment. The answer could lie in the presence of whales, referring to large investors holding significant amounts of a cryptocurrency. Whales have the power to affect market manipulation by selling or buying large quantities of crypto at once. Such actions can cause the price of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to crash or spike. Market manipulation is illegal in traditional finance, but is difficult to detect or regulate in the crypto market. Lastly, many other factors can explain the fluctuations in crypto prices. They range from macroeconomic factors, supply and demand, technical analysis, and market sentiment. Moreover, the fact that most commercial entities don’t yet accept cryptocurrencies makes them more like speculative assets than fiat currencies. By understanding the factors that drive crypto value, investors can navigate the ups and downs and be prepared for volatility. What affects the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Several factors cause cryptocurrencies to rise and fall. Whether it’s economic events, wars, fluctuations in bond and stock markets, or many others, they all have an effect. Unlike fiat currencies whose value is influenced by the government’s monetary policies, cryptocurrencies are fully decentralized. This means the value depends on how much investors are willing to pay. Among the most prominent factors affecting crypto prices are the following: 1. Supply and Demand Supply and demand are essential bases in determining the price of cryptocurrencies. The value of assets like Bitcoin with a maximum supply increases as demand rises. The hard cap of 21 million coins creates scarcity, giving investors the confidence that promotes ongoing demand. On the other hand, an increase in market supply can suppress prices, which dilute the value of a token. 2. Market Sentiment Individuals generally assign value to a product or service based on the item’s market perception. In most cases, the value of an item increases whenever more people are willing to pay its price. For example, the cost of Bitcoin rose to its all-time high of $65K in 2021 following the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. On the flipside, the value of cryptocurrency can go down whenever it loses a positive perception due to adverse events. This can range from unethical behavior from their leaders, bad publicity, or security breaches. 3. Utility Within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, utility means the real-world practical application or functionality of a digital asset. Cryptocurrencies with practical use cases always attract more investors and users, thereby increasing their demand and value. For example, an increase in demand and reduced circulation can lead to higher prices. A cryptocurrency with greater utility makes the network more secure and robust, attracts more participants, and increases demand for the token. 4. Competition As of 2025, there are between 17,000 and 24,000 different types of cryptocurrencies promising different technological advancements and use cases. Leading projects face rival platforms offering lower fees, more scalability, and increased use cases. The ongoing rapid evolution and an influx of new coins keep the cryptocurrency ecosystem healthy, but bring additional volatility. 5. Tokenomics The tokenomics of a cryptocurrency can influence its value based on the supply and demand dynamics. Some important factors include the token’s utility, scarcity, burning mechanism, and distribution model. The side mechanics of a token, such as token burns or limited maximum supply, have the potential to create scarcity and boost the price. However, effective distribution strategies and strong utility can drive its demand and create long-term value. 6. Governance and Regulations Regulation is one of the key factors affecting the present value and future of a cryptocurrency. Developments like legalizing crypto trade or governments offering regulatory clarity can instill investor confidence and price gains. On the other hand, announcements about harsh restrictions and bans can curtail demand and quickly lead to a selloff. Policy shifts keep investors on edge, causing prices to react downwards or upwards based on rumors or updates from lawmakers. 7. Liquidity Liquidity influences investor behavior, price stability, and trading efficiency, and can impact crypto prices. High liquidity facilitates fast, stable, and cost-effective trading while low liquidity causes slippage, higher costs, and greater volatility. Factors associated with liquidity, like market depth, trade volume, and market makers, play a role in ensuring market stability or its absence. How Does Cryptocurrency Gain or Lose Value? The fundamental economic principle of supply and demand explains how cryptocurrency gains or loses value. The price increases whenever demand for a cryptocurrency exceeds its supply. On the other hand, a cryptocurrency loses value during times of high supply and low demand. Other factors that can influence crypto prices include positive or negative media coverage, fraud, security breaches, and regulatory actions. How does crypto make money? Cryptocurrency can generate returns by selling or buying crypto and making a profit from price increases through supply and demand. However, there are other methods, including: Investing: Buy and hold onto a crypto asset, hoping the value will increase over time. Passive Income Streams such as: Staking : Staking or locking up a cryptocurrency to secure a blockchain network and earn rewards. Lending : Lend your idle crypto assets via a DeFi platform and earn interest Mining: Use computers to mine crypto by solving mathematical puzzles to verify blockchain transactions and get rewarded with newly minted coins. Yield Farming: Offer liquidity to DeFi platforms and earn rewards and fees. Affiliate Programs: Earn commissions by referring new users to crypto exchanges and platforms. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs): Investing in new cryptocurrency projects before they become widely available and get high returns if they succeed. Airdrops : Receive free tokens to promote a crypto project’s platform. What causes cryptocurrency to fail? Several factors can cause cryptocurrency to fail, including: Regulatory crackdowns : Whenever governments ban trading or implement increased oversight, it can sap market confidence. Also, when exchanges are shut down or a cryptocurrency is classified as illegal. The same applies to security issues, exchange breaches, high-profile hacks, and a blockchain’s security flaws leading to eroded trust. Market sentiment shifts : Critical comments from mainstream media, influential figures, or warnings from regulators that create widespread fear and panic selling. Supply surges: Releasing a large amount of tokens for project rewards or early investor selloffs can be detrimental. This can make the market unable to absorb the supply and lead to price drops. Technological Failures: Failed upgrades, poor scalability, slow transaction speeds, and bugs can undermine a token’s reputation and cause investors to lose confidence. Can Cryptocurrencies Be Overbought or Oversold? Overbought and oversold are extreme crypto market conditions that occur under different circumstances and impact future price movements. The truth is that just like traditional assets, cryptocurrencies can be oversold or overbought. Overbought : This is a scenario where a cryptocurrency is bought aggressively over a short period. The result is pushing the price to an unsustainable level. The situation is caused chiefly by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and leads to inflated prices. Oversold : This refers to when an asset is sold aggressively and drives the price below its market value. The phenomenon is mainly caused by panic selling. How accurate are cryptocurrency price predictions? The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable, making accurately predicting the future performance of an asset rather difficult. Factors like technological advancement, regulatory changes, or social media trends can have a significant impact on their value. As a result, making accurate price predictions in this dynamic environment is a tricky balancing act. The accuracy of crypto price predictions can vary widely based on the economic theory used, research, and analysis. It is worth noting that in some cases, predictions rely on personal biases and speculation. While evaluating the credibility of the methodology and resources used, remember that even the most accurate price prediction can fail. As the cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, unforeseen circumstances and new developments could disrupt the most well-founded predictions. You must understand the risks and limitations associated with price predictions to make informed investment decisions. It’s also essential to remain updated and adaptable with a critical mindset as you’re dealing with speculative assets. How market cycles affect cryptocurrency prices Different cryptocurrency market cycles drive the process through at least four phases, namely Accumulation, Markup, Distribution, and Markdown. The four phases of the cryptocurrency market cycle are: Accumulation : After a significant price drop, savvy investors buy and wait for the next uptrend. Markup: Price rise as more investors join the market with the growing optimism and positive news leading to bull runs. Distribution: Early investors sell during the peak, take profits, and cause a price fluctuation. This phase comes just before a downturn as sellers outnumber buyers. Markdown: The negative sentiment spreads and causes panic selling, leading to a bear market. Some of the key factors influencing crypto market cycles include macroeconomic factors, investor sentiment, and supply and demand dynamics. The recurring shifts can cause price surges during bullish markets or downturns when sentiment changes and investors panic. Tips for Beginner Investors to Predict Crypto Price Movements Predicting the price movements of cryptocurrencies can be a challenge, especially for new investors. Price fluctuations are swift and unpredictable, and can lead to potential profits or losses overnight. Having insights on what to look for is essential to invest in crypto effectively. Analyze Market Trends: Your first step is to carefully analyze historical price charts and identify short-term, mid-term, and long-term trends. Locate existing patterns and potential turning points that could predict future price movements. You can use technical analysis and tools like the Relative Strength Index and Moving Averages. You can also analyze Moving Average Convergence Divergence to predict future price directions. Sentiment Analysis: You can predict potential price movements through news outlets, social media, and other related forums. You may derive insights from trending news and community thoughts within crypto communities. Stay updated on technological breakthroughs, trend-setting announcements, and word from influential crypto personalities. Fundamental Analysis: Cryptocurrencies don’t have intrinsic value based on earnings and dividends like traditional assets. Key factors in the basic analysis within the crypto space depend on team composition, technology, adoption rates, and network strength. Read project whitepapers and consider their utility, scalability, and partnerships or market trends to evaluate their future potential. Quantitative Analysis: There are quantitative methods that use mathematical models and statistical data to predict future crypto prices. Use quantitative analysis tools and create algorithms to identify patterns that indicate probable predictions based on trade volumes and historical data. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming increasingly popular for quantitative analysis. External Factors and News: Stay updated on external news events, such as geopolitical events and regulatory developments that can impact cryptocurrency prices. Stay abreast with news, legal announcements, and significant updates within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion Understanding “why is crypto going up” or down is essential in helping you make informed investment choices. Due to the unique characteristics of crypto assets, they are notoriously volatile and can be subject to market manipulation. The key factors affecting the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are supply and demand, as well as other market dynamics. Users, especially new ones, must endeavor to conduct proper research on “how crypto has value before investing their cash. Alternatively, you can follow the advice of a qualified expert to stay ahead of the curve in this unpredictable market. As the crypto asset market continues to evolve, staying adaptable is the best way to remain abreast with crypto prices. FAQs The three key factors that drive the rise and fall of crypto are supply \u0026 demand, competition, and market perception. Most crypto assets implement mechanisms that limit their circulating supply to prevent inflation. Market perception closely affects market value, meaning the higher the perception, the greater the asset’s value. Several factors, like economic conditions, company news, and network factors, are primarily responsible for the price swings. Understanding what drives crypto price variations is essential before you consider investing. The limited supply of some cryptocurrencies creates a condition where an increase in demand puts upward pressure on price. Bitcoin, with its maximum supply cap of 21 million coins, is the perfect example. Studies have also shown that investors mostly turn to cryptocurrencies during uncertain times, while some news headlines also impact the market. The price of Bitcoin changes because of its scarcity, market demand, and competition from other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the cost associated with producing Bitcoin through mining can also influence its price. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, there’s no physical asset or government policy that backs Bitcoin. Instead, BTC is supported by a new system using incentives, decentralization, cryptography, and energy. Yes, other financial markets can affect the value of cryptocurrency. However, the degree of the correlation and effects can vary over time based on the particular cryptocurrency. Factors like economic health, fiat currency exchange rates, interest rates, and stock market prices are correlated with crypto prices."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"5:[[\"$\",\"header\",null,{\"className\":\"site-header\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"container\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"header-inner\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$Le\",null,{\"href\":\"/\",\"className\":\"header-brand\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"header-logo\",\"children\":\"C\"}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"header-text\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"children\":[\"Cryptonews\",[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"children\":\".in.th\"}]]}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"children\":\"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator\"}]]}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"header-status\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"className\":\"status-dot\"}],[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"children\":\"Live Feed Active\"}]]}]]}]}]}],[\"$\",\"$Lf\",null,{\"article\":{\"_id\":\"698640074007f0a6ec7f1837\",\"guid\":\"https://nftevening.com/?p=160786\",\"slug\":\"what-makes-crypto-go-up-and-down-a-comprehensive-guide\",\"title\":\"What Makes Crypto Go Up and Down: A Comprehensive Guide\",\"link\":\"https://nftevening.com/what-makes-crypto-go-up-and-down/?utm_source=rss\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=what-makes-crypto-go-up-and-down\",\"pubDate\":\"2026-01-14T17:27:22.000Z\",\"content\":\"The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appears unpredictable and mysterious, especially for beginners.
