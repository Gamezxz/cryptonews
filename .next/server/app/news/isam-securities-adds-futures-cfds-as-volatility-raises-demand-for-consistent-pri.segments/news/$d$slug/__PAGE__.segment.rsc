4:Ta93,iSAM Securities has launched CFDs on futures to meet
what it describes as growing client demand for futures-style exposure with
simpler handling. 
The CFDs include an auto-rolling feature that aims to remove
the need for clients to monitor and switch contracts at expiry while keeping
continuous exposure to the underlying futures market.
More CFD brokers are showing interest in the futures
space. Recently, NinjaTrader expanded its futures offering into Europe through Payward Europe Digital Solutions, a MiFID-regulated investment firm, initially
covering the Netherlands and Germany.
The brokers are increasingly adding futures
and options in what is seen as a response to tighter regulatory restrictions on over-the-counter
derivatives. A survey by Acuiti for CME Group indicating that four in five
firms not currently offering listed products are planning or evaluating such a
move.
Integration with Existing Infrastructure
iSAM Securities says this structure offers exposure to
futures prices while keeping the operational model in a familiar CFD format for
brokers and professional traders. The futures CFDs sit alongside iSAM Securities’
current liquidity and execution services, which use in-house pricing
technology.
According to the company, the online trading firm positions the new instruments as an extension
of its existing liquidity suite. Clients can access the CFDs on futures through
their current accounts, so they do not need additional operational setups to
trade the product.
The firm offers CFDs through entities regulated by the
Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission in the United States, as well as a Cayman Islands Monetary
Authority registered entity.
The firm has in parallel invested in risk and
analytics tools, including its RADAR real-time risk dashboard and Surge
analytics platform, which it distributes directly and through integrations such
as the cTrader link with Spotware. 
Volatility Highlights Demand for Consistent Pricing
iSAM Securities notes that recent weeks of elevated
market volatility have highlighted the importance of consistent pricing, strong
risk controls and reliable trading counterparties.
Recently, iSAM relocated to a new London headquarters
to support the expansion of its operations and growing global demand for its
services. It follows its opening of a Cyprus office in Limassol last May and
its move to a larger office in Hong Kong in June.
The Limassol office was established to support clients
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The group also maintains offices in the
United States and the Cayman Islands.
