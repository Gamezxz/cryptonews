4:T1160,Vitalik Buterin donated to Zcash developer Shielded Labs, backing the Crosslink consensus upgrade. Crosslink improves finality, reducing reorg and double-spend risk while enabling faster confirmations. The move reflects Buterin’s growing focus on privacy as core crypto infrastructure. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has donated to Shielded Labs, backing development of Crosslink, a proposed consensus upgrade for Zcash. The move signals a deepening commitment by Buterin to privacy-preserving infrastructure, as well as growing interest in strengthening finality and settlement guarantees in proof-of-work blockchains. Thank you to @VitalikButerin for supporting Shielded Labs and Crosslink! A portion of the funding will be used to spin up a persistent incentivized testnet, where users running finalizers or staking can earn small amounts of ZEC. We’re looking forward to broader community… https://t.co/a55ufBT3Wm — Jason McGee 🛡 (@aquietinvestor) February 6, 2026 Sponsored Vitalik Doubles Down on Privacy Infranstructure in Crypto Shielded Labs is developing Crosslink, a parallel finality layer designed to sit on top of Zcash’s existing proof-of-work consensus. In simple terms, Crosslink adds a second confirmation system that locks in transactions faster and more decisively. This reduces the risk of chain reorganizations, rollbacks, and double-spend attacks. As a result, exchanges can shorten confirmation times, cross-chain bridges gain stronger security guarantees, and applications become easier to build on Zcash . Zcash good Zooko good Adding hybrid proof of stake good — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 6, 2026 Sponsored What Shielded Labs Does for Zcash Shielded Labs is a Zcash-focused research and engineering group working on core protocol upgrades rather than applications or tooling. Its mandate centers on improving Zcash’s long-term security, usability, and cryptographic guarantees—especially around shielded transactions and privacy-first design . Buterin’s support comes amid a broader shift in his public advocacy toward privacy and resilience over growth metrics or convenience. In recent months, he has repeatedly argued that blockchains must optimize for worst-case scenarios, not best-case user experience. That includes resisting censorship, minimizing trust assumptions, and protecting users even under hostile conditions. Sponsored Privacy, in that framing, is not optional. It is core infrastructure. ZCash Daily Price Chart. Source: CoinGecko The Privacy Push Is More Critical Than Ever Buterin has warned that financial transparency without strong cryptographic privacy creates long-term risks, including surveillance, coercion, and systemic fragility. He has increasingly praised systems that embed privacy at the protocol level rather than layering it on as an optional feature. Zcash’s shielded transaction model aligns closely with that philosophy. Sponsored By backing Shielded Labs, Buterin is effectively endorsing privacy-preserving design paired with stronger settlement guarantees—two areas he sees as underinvested across the industry. Fight Chat Control. You cannot make society secure by making people insecure. We all deserve privacy and security, without inevitably hackable backdoors, for our private communications. The fact that the government officials want to exempt themselves from their own law is… https://t.co/OY5NXyk58j — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 27, 2025 A Signal to the Broader Crypto Ecosystem The donation also lands at a moment when Ethereum itself is reassessing parts of its scaling and security roadmap. While Buterin has criticized superficial innovation and “copy-paste” infrastructure elsewhere, his support for Zcash highlights what he sees as meaningful progress: protocol-level upgrades that improve safety, finality, and user protection. In that sense, the move is less about Ethereum versus Zcash—and more about the kind of blockchain architecture Buterin believes will survive long term.
