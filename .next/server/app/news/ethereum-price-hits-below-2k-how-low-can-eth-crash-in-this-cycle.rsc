10:Tbb2,Ethereum price is another latest victim of the violent cryptocurrency market pangs. ETH price has dropped significantly, slipping below $2K as the latest crypto market dumps took over the sector, wiping away trillions in their wake. This development is now impacting major crypto coins, with the Ethereum price taking a major hit in the middle. The token is down 9% in the last 24 hours, noting a 40% decline in its price in the last month. But is there more to ETH’s price? Will it crash even more than predicted price thresholds?

The latest ETH fall is a result of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, selling 16,384 ETH, causing a temporary market mayhem. Buterin reportedly is selling ETH to solidify future plans for Ethereum, including robusting its stack software and hardware. “If you’re wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH. He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware. This includes areas like privacy-preserving technologies (e.g., ZK proofs, FHE, differential privacy), secure hardware, encrypted messaging apps, local-first software, operating systems, biotech (personal and public health), finance, communication, and governance tools.” If you're wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH: He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware.
