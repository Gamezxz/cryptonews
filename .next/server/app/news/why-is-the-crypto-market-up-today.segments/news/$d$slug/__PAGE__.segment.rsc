4:T11a4,Crypto market rebounds $211 billion as total cap tests $2.37 trillion resistance. Bitcoin attempts reclaim $70,000 support, targeting $75,000 and $80,000 levels near-term recovery. XDC surges 23 percent, leading altcoins as price holds $0.0370 support level. The total crypto market cap (TOTAL) and Bitcoin (BTC) finally broke free from the bearish curse they had been under for the past 12 days. As BTC neared $70,000, it sparked a rally amongst the altcoins as well, led by XDC Network (XDC). In the news today:- Sponsored Sponsored Vitalik Buterin donated to Shielded Labs to support Crosslink , a proposed Zcash consensus upgrade focused on privacy and stronger finality. Crosslink adds a parallel confirmation layer that reduces reorg risk, enabling faster exchange settlements, safer bridges, and more reliable applications on Zcash. Metaplanet reaffirmed its long-term Bitcoin strategy despite a sharp market sell-off that briefly pushed BTC near $60,000. CEO Simon Gerovich acknowledged shareholder pain as the firm’s stock tracked broader crypto market volatility. The Crypto Market Breaths a Sigh Of Relief The total crypto market cap rebounded by $211 billion over the past 24 hours, signaling a relief rally after Thursday’s sharp sell-off. The recovery has improved short-term sentiment across digital assets. Closing the week in positive territory could help stabilize markets and support risk appetite through the weekend. TOTAL is trading near $2.36 trillion at the time of writing, hovering just below the $2.37 trillion resistance. A decisive flip of this level into support would confirm strengthening momentum. Such a move could open the path for a continued advance toward the $2.45 trillion zone. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . TOTAL Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risk remains if bullish momentum fades. Failure to secure $2.37 trillion in support may trigger renewed selling pressure. Under this scenario, TOTAL could slip below the $2.30 trillion level and fall toward $2.22 trillion, erasing a significant portion of the recent recovery. Sponsored Sponsored Bitcoin Attempts Recovery Bitcoin is trading near $69,972 at the time of writing as it attempts to reclaim $70,000. This level remains a key psychological threshold for market participants. A successful flip into support would signal renewed buyer confidence and mark the early stages of a broader recovery attempt. The immediate objective is to secure $70,000 as support and push higher toward $75,000. Achieving this would confirm improving momentum and strengthen bullish structure. If buying pressure persists, Bitcoin could regain traction and set its sights on the $80,000 level in the near term. BTC Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Failure to reclaim $70,000 would weaken the recovery narrative. Renewed selling pressure could drag Bitcoin back toward $65,000 or lower. Such a move would invalidate the bullish thesis, reinforce downside risk, and prolong market uncertainty amid fragile investor sentiment. XDC Network Jumps Sharply XDC led the altcoin market, surging 23% over the past 24 hours to trade near $0.0370 at the time of writing. The rally reflects renewed buying interest and improving sentiment. Securing this level of support is critical for sustaining momentum and confirming the strength of the current price move. XDC is now targeting a move toward $0.0413, but a breakout requires clearing the $0.0392 resistance. Rising inflows and sustained investor participation could provide the needed catalyst. A decisive breach would validate bullish continuation and strengthen confidence in XDC’s short-term recovery trajectory. XDC Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risk remains if support fails to hold. A loss of $0.0370 could push XDC back toward $0.0345. Breaking below that level would expose price to a deeper pullback near $0.0299, erasing much of the recent recovery and weakening the bullish setup.
