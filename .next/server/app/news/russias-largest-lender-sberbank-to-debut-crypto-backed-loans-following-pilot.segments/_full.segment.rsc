10:T88e,In late 2025, the bank piloted a crypto-backed loan with mining firm AO Intelion Data, using self-mined coins as collateral secured via its internal custody system and Rutoken hardware. Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, plans to roll out crypto-backed loans after testing a program in December using self-mined cryptocurrency as collateral, Reuters reported Friday, citing a spokesperson for the bank. The pilot , conducted in collaboration with mining firm AO Intelion Data, aimed to support cooperation with the central bank on crypto regulation and infrastructure, and could extend to any firm holding digital assets, Deputy CEO Anatoly Popov said at the time. According to Sberbank, the upcoming launch is being driven by robust demand from corporate clients. The bank is also broadening its focus to include companies with crypto holdings, in addition to miners. A crypto-backed loan lets borrowers use digital assets as collateral to access fiat or stablecoins. Many banks have begun offering these loans as a high-profit, low-risk way to tap into the digital asset market while addressing the challenges of traditional lending. Wells Fargo, for instance, offers specialized credit lines that include digital assets as part of the collateral package. JPMorgan Chase was reported last year to be preparing to allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as loan collateral. In Russia, Sovcombank became the first major private bank to unlock access to Bitcoin-backed loans. Launched earlier this week, the product caters to companies and individuals legally holding crypto. Apart from the crypto-backed loans, Sberbank is also looking to roll out crypto custody services with account-like safety guarantees and asset-freezing provisions. Crypto is playing a growing role in Russia’s economy and foreign trade, as transactions in most global currencies are targeted by Western sanctions imposed after Russia launched military action in Ukraine. The Russian central bank defines crypto as foreign exchange assets, permitting their purchase and sale but prohibiting domestic payments. The regulator plans to finalize a legislative framework for crypto assets by July 1, 2026.5:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986208ebd1d672632b5d670","guid":"https://cryptobriefing.com/?p=189455","slug":"russias-largest-lender-sberbank-to-debut-crypto-backed-loans-following-pilot","title":"Russia’s largest lender Sberbank to debut crypto-backed loans following pilot","link":"https://cryptobriefing.com/sberbank-crypto-backed-loans/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T17:05:36.000Z","content":"Sberbank's crypto-backed loans could accelerate digital asset integration in Russia's financial system, impacting regulatory and economic landscapes.\nThe post Russia’s largest lender Sberbank to debut crypto-backed loans following pilot appeared first on Crypto Briefing.","author":"Vivian Nguyen","enclosure":"https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06120424/574d84ea-b51e-4b41-8098-4a660657c3d9-400x210.jpg","source":"Crypto Briefing","sourceCategory":"general","category":"regulation","categories":["regulation"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"Sberbank ธนาคารที่ใหญ่ที่สุดของรัสเซีย เตรียมเปิดตัวสินเชื่อรับประกันด้วย crypto หลังการทดลองใช้งาน","translatedContent":"สินเชื่อที่รับประกันด้วย crypto ของ Sberbank อาจเร่งการผนวกรวมสินทรัพย์ดิจิทัลเข้ากับระบบการเงินของรัสเซีย ส่งผลกระทบต่อภูมิทัศน์ด้านกฎระเบียบและเศรษฐกิจ","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$10","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":329,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T17:10:38.504Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T17:10:38.505Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T06:03:02.878Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986d59738f2116917d8f81c","category":"defi","pubDate":"2026-02-07T06:02:15.000Z","slug":"flakeexchange-a-faster-way-to-swap-and-bridge-crypto-cross-chain","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Flake.exchange: A Faster Way to Swap and Bridge Crypto Cross-Chain","translatedTitle":"Flake.exchange: วิธีการแลกเปลี่ยนและเชื่อมโยง Crypto ข้าม Chain ที่เร็วขึ้น"},{"_id":"6986d16c38f2116917d8b420","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:00.000Z","slug":"xrp-still-in-bull-market-versus-bitcoin-and-xrpbtc-chart-puts-51-upside-on-the-m","source":"U.Today","title":"XRP Still in Bull Market Versus Bitcoin, and XRP/BTC Chart Puts 51% Upside on the Menu","translatedTitle":"XRP ยังอยู่ในตลาดเพชรฟองต่อบิทคอยน์ และแผนภูมิ XRP/BTC มีศักยภาพเพิ่มขึ้น 51%"},{"_id":"6986ccbc38f2116917d8608a","category":"regulation","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:24:24.000Z","slug":"ondo-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-can-ondo-hit-10","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Ondo Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Can Ondo Hit $10?","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคาโอนโด ปี 2026, 2027 – 2030: โอนโดสามารถถึง $10 ได้ไหม?"},{"_id":"6986ca6638f2116917d84b63","category":"regulation","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:10:53.000Z","slug":"hedera-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-will-hbar-price-hit-05","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Hedera Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5?","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคา Hedera ปี 2026, 2027 - 2030: ราคา HBAR จะสามารถถึง $0.5 ได้ไหม"}]}],"$L11"]
