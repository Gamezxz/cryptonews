4:T88e,In late 2025, the bank piloted a crypto-backed loan with mining firm AO Intelion Data, using self-mined coins as collateral secured via its internal custody system and Rutoken hardware. Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, plans to roll out crypto-backed loans after testing a program in December using self-mined cryptocurrency as collateral, Reuters reported Friday, citing a spokesperson for the bank. The pilot , conducted in collaboration with mining firm AO Intelion Data, aimed to support cooperation with the central bank on crypto regulation and infrastructure, and could extend to any firm holding digital assets, Deputy CEO Anatoly Popov said at the time. According to Sberbank, the upcoming launch is being driven by robust demand from corporate clients. The bank is also broadening its focus to include companies with crypto holdings, in addition to miners. A crypto-backed loan lets borrowers use digital assets as collateral to access fiat or stablecoins. Many banks have begun offering these loans as a high-profit, low-risk way to tap into the digital asset market while addressing the challenges of traditional lending. Wells Fargo, for instance, offers specialized credit lines that include digital assets as part of the collateral package. JPMorgan Chase was reported last year to be preparing to allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as loan collateral. In Russia, Sovcombank became the first major private bank to unlock access to Bitcoin-backed loans. Launched earlier this week, the product caters to companies and individuals legally holding crypto. Apart from the crypto-backed loans, Sberbank is also looking to roll out crypto custody services with account-like safety guarantees and asset-freezing provisions. Crypto is playing a growing role in Russia’s economy and foreign trade, as transactions in most global currencies are targeted by Western sanctions imposed after Russia launched military action in Ukraine. The Russian central bank defines crypto as foreign exchange assets, permitting their purchase and sale but prohibiting domestic payments. The regulator plans to finalize a legislative framework for crypto assets by July 1, 2026.0:{"buildId":"GftxNp3x-Xa_Kmnux4kN_","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986208ebd1d672632b5d670","guid":"https://cryptobriefing.com/?p=189455","slug":"russias-largest-lender-sberbank-to-debut-crypto-backed-loans-following-pilot","title":"Russia’s largest lender Sberbank to debut crypto-backed loans following pilot","link":"https://cryptobriefing.com/sberbank-crypto-backed-loans/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T17:05:36.000Z","content":"Sberbank's crypto-backed loans could accelerate digital asset integration in Russia's financial system, impacting regulatory and economic landscapes.\nThe post Russia’s largest lender Sberbank to debut crypto-backed loans following pilot appeared first on Crypto Briefing.","author":"Vivian Nguyen","enclosure":"https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06120424/574d84ea-b51e-4b41-8098-4a660657c3d9-400x210.jpg","source":"Crypto Briefing","sourceCategory":"general","category":"regulation","categories":["regulation"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"Sberbank ธนาคารที่ใหญ่ที่สุดของรัสเซีย เตรียมเปิดตัวสินเชื่อรับประกันด้วย crypto หลังการทดลองใช้งาน","translatedContent":"สินเชื่อที่รับประกันด้วย crypto ของ Sberbank อาจเร่งการผนวกรวมสินทรัพย์ดิจิทัลเข้ากับระบบการเงินของรัสเซีย ส่งผลกระทบต่อภูมิทัศน์ด้านกฎระเบียบและเศรษฐกิจ","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$4","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":329,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T17:10:38.504Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T17:10:38.505Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T19:15:48.306Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"698637f4bd1d672632b60d60","slug":"cryptos-eligibility-for-401k-retirement-funds-is-under-fire-after-brutal-market-","title":"Crypto's eligibility for 401k retirement funds is under fire after brutal market rout wipes out $2 trillion","pubDate":"2026-02-06T18:44:57.000Z","source":"CoinDesk","category":"regulation","translatedTitle":"ความเหมาะสมของ Crypto ในกองทุน 401k ถูกวิพากษ์วิจารณ์อย่างหนัก หลังตลาดพุ่งดิ่งทำให้มูลค่าหายไป 2 ล้านล้านดอลลาร์"},{"_id":"6986347abd1d672632b6064e","slug":"brazil-prepares-to-tax-cryptocurrency-flows","title":"Brazil Prepares to Tax Cryptocurrency Flows","pubDate":"2026-02-06T18:30:51.000Z","source":"Bitcoin.com","category":"ethereum","translatedTitle":"บราซิลเตรียมเก็บภาษีการไหลเวียนของ Cryptocurrency"},{"_id":"69862793bd1d672632b5e71f","slug":"goldman-sachs-teams-up-with-anthropic-to-create-autonomous-ai-agents-for-interna","title":"Goldman Sachs teams up with Anthropic to create autonomous AI agents for internal banking tasks","pubDate":"2026-02-06T17:38:15.000Z","source":"Crypto Briefing","category":"regulation","translatedTitle":"Goldman Sachs ร่วมมือกับ Anthropic เพื่อสร้าง AI agents อัตโนมัติสำหรับงานธนาคารภายใน"},{"_id":"69862667bd1d672632b5e59e","slug":"link-price-struggles-near-860-as-reserves-grow-and-etf-inflows-diverge-from-mark","title":"LINK Price Struggles Near $8.60 as Reserves Grow and ETF Inflows Diverge From Market Weakness","pubDate":"2026-02-06T17:32:35.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"regulation","translatedTitle":"ราคา LINK ยังคงดิ้นรนอยู่ใกล้ระดับ $8.60 ขณะที่ทุนสำรองเพิ่มขึ้นและกระแสเข้า ETF แยกตัวออกจากความอ่อนแอของตลาด"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
