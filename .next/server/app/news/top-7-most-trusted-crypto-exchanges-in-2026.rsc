Estimates generally range from around 200 to as many as 2,000 platforms. This wide variation stems from differences in how exchanges are defined and categorized. Some classifications distinguish between centralized and decentralized exchanges, while others are based on activity levels, such as high-volume platforms versus newer or less active ones. Additional factors—including liquidity, user traffic, trading volume, and the types of assets offered—are also commonly used to identify and classify platforms considered to be exchanges.
