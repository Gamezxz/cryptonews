We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error. We close with a practical question: how retail investors can actually use AI without falling into common traps.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Furuichi has \"resigned\" from his role as\nRepresentative Director and CEO of IG Japan. He posted the news on LinkedIn\ntoday (Thursday). He held the role for nearly seven years.\nSeparately, IG Securities, the Japanese arm of IG Group, has\nstopped offering cryptocurrency ETF CFDs. The decision follows guidance\nfrom Japan’s Financial Services Agency clarifying that derivatives based on\noverseas crypto ETFs are treated as crypto-related products and fall under\ndomestic regulations, since the creation and sale of such ETFs is currently\nprohibited in Japan.\nIG Japan CEO Resigns After Growth\nIn the post, Furuichi said: “IG Japan has become several\ntimes bigger than it used to be. It has become the largest foreign-branded\nretail broker in Japan, despite operating in a smaller segment, OTC\nderivatives. I have given all I could, and time has come for a new leader.”\nFuruichi has held senior roles in both financial and\nconsumer sectors in Japan. He was CEO of GILT Groupe K.K., an online luxury\nretail company with around 130 employees, for about one and a half years. He\noversaw a change program covering strategy, organization, and operations, which\nled to profitability and revenue growth. He left after the parent company sold\nthe business.\nFuruichi’s Career Spans Finance and Retail\nBefore that, Furuichi spent nearly six years as a director\nand board member at Samantha Thavasa Japan Limited, overseeing store\noperations, production and logistics, IT, HR, e-commerce, and overseas\nbusiness, while leading corporate change initiatives.\nEarlier in his career, he worked for almost three years as a\nsenior director at AlixPartners in the Greater Tokyo Area.\nNew Client Discount Program Concludes\nIG Japan’s subsidiary discontinued\nits introductory trading program for new clients. The program, which\nallowed reduced minimum trading during the first two weeks after account\nopening, was phased out.\nIG Japan said the decision followed earlier changes to\nproduct sizes, which created a “more comfortable trading environment” and\nreduced the need for incentives. Accounts opened before the termination date\ncontinued to receive the program benefits until it ended.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Tareq Sikder at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
