4:T1e7b,Bitcoin contributors appear in new Epstein files release. The late sex offender tried to steer early development. Epstein indirectly funded Bitcoin Core developers in 2015. The latest batch of the “Epstein files” has shed fresh light on the late sex offender’s dealings with some of the Bitcoin blockchain’s most influential developers. Recorded within the millions of previously unseen pages are numerous business deals, introductions, and conversations between Epstein and developers which span almost seven years. Epstein’s early fascination with Bitcoin is well-documented. He donated a total of $850,000 to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology between 2002 and 2017, with $525,000 specifically allocated to the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative. In 2015, some of this funding was indirectly used to pay Bitcoin Core contributors who joined the lab after the Bitcoin Foundation ran out of money. Epstein was in frequent contact with Joichi Ito, a Japanese entrepreneur who directed the MIT Media Lab between 2011 and 2019. The pair’s contributions helped position MIT as a central hub for Bitcoin protocol work. “This is a big win for us,” Ito said to Epstein in an email discussing that the Bitcoin Core developers had joined the MIT Media Lab. The Bitcoin developers are mentioned in the emails for various reasons. Inclusion of their names and communications in the files does not necessarily indicate evidence of any wrongdoing. All the interactions took place after Epstein’s 2008 convictions by a Florida state court of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. Taken together, the communications reveal Epstein’s fascination with Bitcoin and its developers, and, in many cases, highlight a desire to use his power, wealth, and connections to steer the $1.5 trillion blockchain’s development. Jeremy Rubin Jeremy Rubin is a prominent Bitcoin Core developer, researcher, and entrepreneur. He’s most well-known for co-founding the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, which Epstein later helped fund. The first mention of him in the Epstein files was in June 2014, while he was a student at MIT. An email between Epstein and Lesley Groff, Epstein’s personal aide, shows her trying to arrange a call between the two men. In December 2015, Rubin reached out to Epstein directly via email. “I was wondering if you would be interested in financing my continued research in this space, or if there are any projects you’d want to push forward that I might play a role in,” he said. “I’d also love to learn more from you about how financial markets really work and build some of my own ‘exploits’ at some point.” “Their deal is to pump the currency, it is dangerous.” — Jeffrey Epstein Epstein responded by suggesting ways Rubin could receive money from him. “One, you can merely work for me, salary. Two, start a company, hire others, I make an investment (more paperwork). Three, do research. Tax advantages but restricted. I can easily pay your tuition. Or some combo of the above,” Epstein said. By 2018, the pair’s relationship appears to have developed. Emails show they arranged to meet in person in June, and also made several introductions for each other. The same year, Rubin also pitched Epstein on potential crypto-related investments, including a potential deal in Layer 1, a Bitcoin mining firm. Epstein responded cautiously. “Jeremy I am more than happy to fund things but as I am high profile, it can’t be questionable ethics,” he said. “Their deal is to pump the currency, it is dangerous.” Rubin has since commented publicly on his ties to Epstein. “I’m glad the emails are being released,” he said on February 2, adding that he had “some professional engagement” with Epstein, which was “never exclusive.” “I hope the release of the emails brings us closer to justice for those harmed and a better understanding of the nature of corruption in our society,” he said. Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields are three Bitcoin Core developers who joined the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative in 2015. Their names appeared in the files in an April 2015 email between Ito, then-director of the DCI, and Epstein. In the email, Ito explains that Andresen, van der Laan and Fields were being paid for their work on Bitcoin by a non-profit organisation called the Bitcoin Foundation, which had declared bankruptcy several weeks prior. The idea is great, the execution as you are now aware has some serious risks.” — Jeffrey Epstein “Many organizations scrambled to step into the vacuum created by the foundation and ‘take control’ of the developers,” Ito said. “We moved quickly talking to all of the various stakeholders and the three developers decided to join the Media Lab. This is a big win for us.” Epstein also attempted to meet with Andresen as early as 2011, months after he had taken over as lead maintainer of the Bitcoin source code from Satoshi Nakamoto , the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. “Gavin, I spoke with Jason Calacanis. I would like to speak with you. Call my office in NY. The idea is great, the execution as you are now aware has some serious risks,” Epstein said in a June 2011 email to Andresen. Calacanis is a prominent US investor and well-known for The All-In Podcast. “Jeffrey Epstein will be up at Harvard this Friday June 17th and Saturday June 18th. He would love to meet with you. Might you be around and have some available time?” one of Epstein’s aides said in an email to Andresen days later. “No, sorry, I’m busy,” Andresen replied. There is no evidence so far that Wladimir van der Laan or Cory Fields communicated directly with Epstein or his aides. Andresen has kept a low profile since he stopped contributing to Bitcoin in 2016. He hasn’t responded publicly to his name appearing in the Epstein files, and didn’t immediately respond to DL News ’ request for comment. Amir Taaki Amir Taaki is an influential Bitcoin Core contributor who was among the first to join after Satoshi Nakamoto left the project in 2010. “They are crazy open source folks who are radicals, their motivation is more in line with Wikileaks or Wikipedia.” — Jason Calacanis Taaki is first mentioned in the Epstein files, alongside Gavin Andresen, in a June 2011 email from Calacanis. “I would like to get in touch with the Bitcoin guys,” Epstein said. “Will dig up their info,” Calacanis responded. “So you know, these are folks who are not trying to build a business. They are crazy open source folks who are radicals, their motivation is more in line with Wikileaks or Wikipedia.” In July 2011, Epstein emailed Taaki directly. “Amir, the Bitcoin idea is brilliant, but I suggest it has some serious downsides as I’m sure you are aware. If you can find time please call my NY office,” he said. At the time, Taaki was running Bitcoin Consultancy, a group focused on Bitcoin project development, consulting, and promotion, with co-founder Donald Norman. In a July 7 email, Taaki suggested a meeting between Epstein and Norman in New York. On February 2, Taaki, addressing his inclusion in the Epstein files, said that he and Norman decided to cut communications after Norman met Epstein and looked into the financier’s past and the allegations against him.
