4:Tbd7,Bitcoin has pulled back from recent highs of $98K, slipping back into the low-$90Ks. Momentum has cooled but remains above neutral, pointing to consolidation rather than trend deterioration. Overview Spot conditions show early signs of improvement. Trading volume has lifted modestly, while the net buy–sell imbalance has broken above its upper statistical band, signalling a clear reduction in sell-side pressure. Despite this, spot demand remains fragile and uneven. Derivatives positioning is mixed. Futures open interest has edged higher, reflecting a cautious rebuild in speculative engagement, while funding rates have cooled sharply, indicating reduced long-side urgency. Perpetual CVD remains negative, highlighting ongoing sell-side activity in leveraged markets. Options markets continue to price elevated uncertainty. Options open interest has risen, while the volatility spread sits near the upper end of its historical range, signalling implied volatility remains elevated relative to realised levels. Downside protection demand remains persistent. US spot ETF flows have reversed sharply into strong inflows, moving beyond statistical extremes and signalling renewed institutional accumulation. ETF trading volumes have risen alongside this shift, though elevated holder profitability raises near-term profit-taking risk. On-chain activity is stabilising. Active addresses remain subdued but are improving, while transfer volume continues to trend higher. Network fees have lifted modestly, and elevated short-term holder supply keeps the market sensitive to price moves. Overall, Bitcoin remains in consolidation, but internal conditions are improving. While defensive positioning persists, strengthening buy-side dynamics and renewed institutional interest suggest a gradual rebuild toward a more constructive market structure.
