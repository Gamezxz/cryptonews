4:Tfa2,IBIT’s heavy Bitcoin flows and rising institutional demand collide with growing “harvest now, decrypt later” fears and BMIC’s push for post-quantum wallet security. Summary BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust now holds about 764,893 BTC, or roughly 3.64% of the eventual 21 million supply, intensifying focus on centralization and key management. ​ Security researchers warn of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks, where adversaries stockpile today’s encrypted blockchain data for future quantum decryption once ECC is broken. BMIC’s presale pitches a “Quantum Meta-Cloud” with ERC‑4337 smart accounts and signature‑hiding wallets that keep public keys off‑chain to mitigate future quantum attacks. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust recorded substantial daily trading volume, according to Nasdaq data, as digital asset security concerns related to quantum computing threats gain attention among institutional investors. The trading volume spike occurred without a corresponding price decline, a pattern market analysts characterize as a transfer of holdings from retail investors to institutional buyers, according to industry observers. The development suggests Bitcoin’s evolving role in institutional portfolios as a macro hedge asset. The concentration of digital asset wealth through centralized issuers has raised concerns about vulnerabilities in current cryptographic standards. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), the encryption method protecting most cryptocurrency assets, faces potential obsolescence with advances in quantum computing technology, according to cybersecurity experts. Security researchers have identified a threat vector known as “harvest now, decrypt later,” in which encrypted data is collected for future decryption once quantum computing capabilities mature. Nation-state actors are reportedly employing this strategy, according to cybersecurity analysts. BMIC , a blockchain security project, has positioned itself to address quantum computing threats to cryptocurrency holdings. The project has raised undisclosed funds during its presale phase, according to company announcements. The protocol utilizes what the company describes as a “ Quantum Meta-Cloud” and AI-enhanced threat detection systems designed to prevent public key exposure during transactions. Traditional cryptocurrency wallets reveal public keys when transactions are signed, creating potential vulnerabilities to future quantum algorithms, according to the project’s technical documentation. BMIC’s architecture incorporates ERC-4337 Smart Accounts, a wallet standard that eliminates seed phrase requirements while implementing quantum-resistant cryptographic methods, according to the company. The platform offers quantum-secure staking options designed to generate yield without exposing private keys to network participants. The project’s early funding stage has attracted capital from investors focused on blockchain infrastructure security, according to industry reports. Market observers note a growing focus on post-quantum cryptographic solutions as digital asset valuations increase. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has reached approximately one trillion dollars, protected by cryptographic standards developed before quantum computing emerged as a practical threat. Protocols offering migration paths to post-quantum security standards may command market premiums as institutional adoption increases, according to blockchain analysts. The cryptocurrency industry faces pressure to upgrade security infrastructure as quantum computing technology advances. Traditional encryption methods protecting blockchain assets may require replacement with quantum-resistant alternatives within the coming decade, according to estimates from technology researchers. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and presale investments involve additional uncertainties. Investors should conduct independent research before making investment decisions.0:{"buildId":"J-5ZVPn6A93od_1TUxTCt","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d3382c","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448610","__v":0,"aiSummary":"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has accumulated approximately 3.64% of the total Bitcoin supply, reflecting a significant shift in holdings from retail to institutional investors.
