We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

and MarketAxess posted record-breaking volumes in January, reflecting\nheightened institutional activity across rates and credit markets.\nTradeweb\nreported total trading volume of $65.5 trillion for the month, with average\ndaily volume reaching $3.1 trillion, up 26.2% year-over-year. Meanwhile,\nMarketAxess logged record average daily volume of $18.6 billion in total\ncredit, a 28% jump from January 2025. The company's rates business grew 19%\nyear-over-year, bringing total platform ADV to $47.7 billion, up 23%.\n“In\nJanuary, we delivered 28% growth year-over-year in total credit on record ADV\nof $18.6 billion, and 19% growth in total rates,” said Chris Concannon,\nCEO of MarketAxess. “In credit, our emerging markets ADV increased 50% to\na record $5.5 billion, almost 30% above the previous monthly record set last\nyear.”\nCredit Markets Lead Growth\nBoth\nplatforms saw particularly strong growth in credit markets. Tradeweb's fully\nelectronic U.S. credit ADV rose 24.4% year-over-year to $9.4 billion, while\nEuropean credit jumped 44% to $3.5 billion. The company captured 17.5% market\nshare of fully electronic U.S. high-grade TRACE and 7.1% of high-yield TRACE.\nMarketAxess\nposted U.S. high-grade ADV of $8.4 billion, up 20% from the prior year. The\ncompany's emerging markets business stood out, with ADV climbing 50% to $5.5\nbillion, nearly 30% above the previous monthly record. Hard currency volumes\nrose 28% while local markets surged 94%. BlackRock and\nMarketAxess have deepened their collaboration to optimize global credit markets, which\nmay be contributing to the strong institutional flows.\nRates Trading Surges on\nPolicy Uncertainty\nGovernment\ntrading picked up momentum as political tensions and shifting inflation\nexpectations drove positioning. Tradeweb's U.S. government ADV increased 15.3%\nto $267.7 billion, while European government volumes surged 36% to $79.4\nbillion.\nInterest\nrate derivatives showed the sharpest gains on Tradeweb's platform. Swaps and\nswaptions with maturities of one year or longer climbed 34.6% to $591 billion\nin daily volume, while total rates derivatives ADV surged 51.1% to $1.2\ntrillion.\nTradeweb's\nmortgage trading hit an all-time high, with ADV up 16.7% to $310.1\nbillion. Tradeweb's\nyear-end trading volume hit $63 trillion in December, showing the momentum has carried\ninto the new year.\nNew Protocols Gain Ground\nMarketAxess\nhighlighted growth in newer execution methods. Block trading ADV jumped 56%\nyear-over-year, with U.S. credit block volumes up 35% and emerging markets\nblock trading doubling to $2.5 billion. Portfolio trading volumes more than\ndoubled, rising 126% to $2 billion in daily volume.\nDealer-initiated\nactivity increased 13% to $1.8 billion, with Mid-X trading volume hitting a\nrecord $6.9 billion, up 383%. Tradeweb reported record European credit volumes\ndriven by increased adoption of its Automated Intelligent Execution tool.\nMeanwhile, institutional\nFX volumes eased in December after a three-month rally, but the fixed-income platforms showed\nno signs of cooling as 2026 began. The January results suggest electronic\ntrading continues to capture share from traditional voice-based execution,\nparticularly in credit and emerging market products.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
