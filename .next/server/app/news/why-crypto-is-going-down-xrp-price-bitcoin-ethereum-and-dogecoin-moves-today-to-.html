Bitcoin fell over 3% to test the $70,000 mark, decisively breaking the $74,000 support level, while altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, and Dogecoin also hit significant lows. Technical analysis suggests further downside potential, with Bitcoin targeting $68,000 or even $52,000, and XRP facing potential declines toward $0.53 if support levels fail to hold.
The selloff accelerated into a &quot;mass capitulation&quot; of long positions, fueled by unsustainable leverage and retail FOMO following the recent &quot;Black Sunday II&quot; event. Analysts identify critical support levels for Ethereum around $2,100 and Dogecoin at $0.10, warning that breaking these thresholds could lead to deeper corrections.

XRP is crashing over 7% below $1.40, Ethereum is falling to $2,068 (its lowest since May 2025), and Dogecoin is battling $0.10 support. Why is crypto going down today? Let&#x27;s check current Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP and Ethereum prices The cryptocurrency market plunged for the third consecutive session on Thursday, February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin dropping 3.5% to test $70,000, the lowest level since November 2024, before recovering slightly to $71,340. XRP crashed over 7% below $1.40, Ethereum fell to $2,068 (lowest since May 2025), and Dogecoin battles support at $0.10 as $775 million in leveraged positions were liquidated . In this article I analyze XRP/USDT, BTC/USD, ETH/USDT and DOGE/USDT charts, answering the question of why crypto is going down today. Why Bitcoin Is Going Down? Breaking Through $74K Opens Path to $68K Bitcoin&#x27;s price fell for the third straight session, dropping 3.5% to test $70,052 , the lowest since November 2024, before recovering to $71,340, down 1.5%. This represents a decisive break below my target range of $74,000 that I&#x27;ve been discussing since November. While I forecasted a potential bounce at $74,000 , I practice reactive analysis rather than wishful thinking analysis , which means I was prepared for this scenario as well. With the breakdown confirmed, I&#x27;m now targeting $68,000 , where the 200-week exponential moving average (200 WMA) runs on the weekly chart. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll expect a demand reaction. If that level also fails to hold, I have my long-term ultra-bearish target around $52,000 , where the 100% Fibonacci extension based on the current trend lands. One thing is certain: pressure on cryptocurrencies continues to persist . Bitcoin is now approximately 45% below its October peak near $126,000, with the recent drawdown accelerating as expectations that BTC would never revisit sub-$100K levels were shattered. Why Bitcoin price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com Joel Kruger, crypto strategist at LMAX, offers perspective on the brutal selloff while identifying potential bottoming signals. &quot;Price action across crypto has been undeniably heavy over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin acting as the primary drag on broader sentiment and ETH following suit,&quot; Kruger notes. However, he points to emerging signs of exhaustion. Follow me on X for more crypto market analysis: @ChmielDk XRP Price Analysis: Testing $1.40 Opens Path to $1.25 or $0.53 XRP is also falling for the third consecutive session, and today is one of the strongest declines this year, losing over 7% and testing levels below $1.40 . If we exclude October&#x27;s flash crash, this is the lowest value since November 2024. Breaking the local support defined by April 2025 lows opens the path toward targets in the $1.25-1.26 range , the minimums from the aforementioned flash crash. If this level also fails to hold, I&#x27;m targeting just $0.53 on the XRP chart. Why XRP price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com What would need to happen for me to change my bearish stance? Such scenarios are really far away, XRP would need to return above $2.20 , where the 200-day EMA currently sits. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Fighting $0.10 Support Dogecoin ( DOGE ), like BTC and XRP, is falling for the third consecutive session and is fighting with local support around the round level of $0.10 , which coincides with the lowest levels since September 2024. Doge already broke its important support at the end of January, located just below $0.12 , and is currently in short-term consolidation at medium-term lows. Bearish pressure remains strong here, and breaking this level will open the path to declines toward 2024 minimums around $0.08 . Why Dogecoin price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com To relieve pressure from Dogecoin&#x27;s shoulders, we would need to wait until around $0.16 , where the 200 EMA sits. Ethereum Price Analysis: $2,068 Tests June 2025 Support Ethereum&#x27;s price, unlike the three charts mentioned above, is also falling for the third consecutive session, deepening this year&#x27;s lows on Thursday to $2,068 —the lowest value since May 2025. Support designated by June 2024 lows around $2,100 continues to hold price in check, and today we also see a reaction at this level. As a result, ETH is currently losing only 0.7% and changing hands at $2,132 . Why Ethereum price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com Although bearish pressure persists, even if the current support breaks, the next support sits around $1,760 (March 2025 lows), and the final ultimate level around $1,400 (April 2024 yearly lows). According to my technical analysis, Ethereum prices could fall to $1,725 or lower in February , aligning with the inverted cup and handle downside target, which historically achieves its expected target with an 82% success rate. I&#x27;ll abandon bearish scenarios when ETH returns at least to the consolidation range drawn from November to the end of January, between $2,750 and $3,430 . Why Is Crypto Crashing Today? $775 Million Liquidation Cascade Thursday&#x27;s crypto crash triggered a massive $775 million liquidation event across major exchanges as Bitcoin plunged to $70,000. What began as a minor technical correction &quot;accelerated into a mass capitulation of long positions,&quot; according to market analysis. The violent flush caught leverage traders off guard, with open interest ballooning to unsustainable levels over the past week driven by retail FOMO and aggressive perpetual positioning. When the floor gave way, algorithmic selling pressure was instantaneous. Recent data shows over $800 million in leveraged liquidations impacting around 165,000 traders, with the majority coming from long positions. This follows the February 1 &quot;Black Sunday II&quot; event that saw $2.2 billion liquidated in 24 hours, the largest single-day wipeout since October 2025. Hawkish Federal Reserve Policy &quot;The recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has been swift and severe, with analysts attributing the decline to the appointment of Kevin Warsh as the prospective chair of the Federal Reserve, amid expectations that he might reduce the Fed&#x27;s balance sheet,&quot; according to Reuters. Signs of ongoing high interest rates have pushed the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) above 97.5 , making investors less interested in riskier assets like Bitcoin. The Fed&#x27;s January 28 hold at 3.50-3.75% with Powell stating he&#x27;s &quot;not in a hurry to cut&quot; continued to weigh on risk assets, with real yields remaining elevated. Institutional Outflows Accelerate Big investors such as BlackRock have sold large amounts of Bitcoin, with $373.8 million leaving spot BTC ETFs recently. Bitcoin ETFs have continued bleeding with cumulative multi-billion dollar outflows since mid-January, removing spot bid support and forcing correlated selling in leveraged products. Technical Targets Table With clear breaks below key support levels across major cryptocurrencies, here are my next technical targets: Crypto Current Price Next Target Ultra-Bearish Target Bull Invalidation Bitcoin $71,340 $68,000 (200-week EMA) $52,000 (100% Fib) Above $84,000 XRP Below $1.40 $1.25-1.26 (Oct flash crash) $0.53 (long-term) Above $2.20 (200 EMA) Ethereum $2,132 $1,760 (Mar 2025 lows) $1,400 (Apr 2024 lows) $2,750-3,430 range Dogecoin $0.10 $0.08 (2024 lows) N/A Above $0.16 (200 EMA) Crypto Price Analysis, FAQ Why is crypto falling today? Crypto crashed for the third consecutive session on February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin testing $70,000 (lowest since Nov 2024), triggering $775 million in liquidations. Kevin Warsh&#x27;s Fed Chair appointment raised expectations for balance sheet reduction and hawkish policy, pushing DXY above 97.5 and making risk assets less attractive. How low can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin broke my November target of $74,000 and tested $70,052 before recovering to $71,340. The next technical target is $68,000 where the 200-week EMA provides critical support, with an ultra-bearish scenario targeting $52,000 (100% Fibonacci extension). Analysts Peter Brandt and Michael Burry identify support levels at $60,176 and $47,824 if $70,000 breaks. LMAX&#x27;s Joel Kruger notes Bitcoin is &quot;roughly 45% below its October peak&quot; with &quot;hallmarks of capitulation now in place.&quot; Why is XRP crashing? XRP crashed over 7% on Thursday to below $1.40—the lowest since November 2024 excluding October&#x27;s flash crash. Breaking April 2025 local support opens the path to $1.25-1.26 (October flash crash lows), with the long-term ultra-bearish target at $0.53. Bull invalidation requires a return above $2.20 where the 200-day EMA currently sits, representing a 57% rally from current levels.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

market plunged for the third consecutive session on Thursday,\nFebruary 5, 2026, with Bitcoin dropping 3.5% to test $70,000, the lowest level\nsince November 2024, before recovering slightly to $71,340. \nXRP crashed\nover 7% below $1.40, Ethereum fell to $2,068 (lowest since May 2025), and\nDogecoin battles support at $0.10 as $775 million in leveraged\npositions were liquidated. \nIn this article\nI analyze XRP/USDT, BTC/USD, ETH/USDT and DOGE/USDT charts, answering the\nquestion of why crypto is going down today.\nWhy Bitcoin Is Going Down?\nBreaking Through $74K Opens Path to $68K\nBitcoin's\nprice fell for the third straight session, dropping 3.5% to test $70,052,\nthe lowest since November 2024, before recovering to $71,340, down 1.5%. This\nrepresents a decisive break below my target range of $74,000 that I've been\ndiscussing since November.\nWhile\nI forecasted a potential bounce at $74,000, I practice reactive\nanalysis rather than wishful thinking analysis, which means I was prepared\nfor this scenario as well. With the breakdown confirmed, I'm\nnow targeting $68,000, where the 200-week exponential\nmoving average (200 WMA) runs on the weekly chart. That's where I'll\nexpect a demand reaction.\nIf that\nlevel also fails to hold, I have my long-term ultra-bearish target around $52,000,\nwhere the 100% Fibonacci extension based on the current trend lands. One thing\nis certain: pressure on cryptocurrencies continues to persist.\nBitcoin is\nnow approximately 45% below its October peak near $126,000,\nwith the recent drawdown accelerating as expectations that BTC would never\nrevisit sub-$100K levels were shattered.\nJoel\nKruger, crypto strategist at LMAX, offers perspective on the brutal selloff\nwhile identifying potential bottoming signals.\n\"Price\naction across crypto has been undeniably heavy over the past 24 hours, with\nbitcoin acting as the primary drag on broader sentiment and ETH following\nsuit,\" Kruger notes. However, he points to emerging signs of exhaustion.\nFollow\nme on X for more crypto market analysis: @ChmielDk\nXRP Price Analysis:\nTesting $1.40 Opens Path to $1.25 or $0.53\nXRP is also\nfalling for the third consecutive session, and today is one of the strongest\ndeclines this year, losing over 7% and testing levels below $1.40.\nIf we exclude October's flash crash, this is the lowest value since November\n2024.\nBreaking\nthe local support defined by April 2025 lows opens the path\ntoward targets in the $1.25-1.26 range, the minimums from\nthe aforementioned flash crash. If this level also fails to hold, I'm targeting\njust $0.53 on the XRP chart.\nWhat would\nneed to happen for me to change my bearish stance? Such scenarios are really\nfar away, XRP would need to return above $2.20, where the 200-day\nEMA currently sits.\nDogecoin Price Analysis:\nFighting $0.10 Support\nDogecoin (DOGE), like BTC\nand XRP, is falling for the third consecutive session and is fighting with\nlocal support around the round level of $0.10, which coincides with\nthe lowest levels since September 2024.\nDoge\nalready broke its important support at the end of January, located just\nbelow $0.12, and is currently in short-term consolidation at\nmedium-term lows. Bearish pressure remains strong here, and breaking this level\nwill open the path to declines toward 2024 minimums around $0.08.\nTo relieve\npressure from Dogecoin's shoulders, we would need to wait until around $0.16,\nwhere the 200 EMA sits.\nEthereum Price Analysis:\n$2,068 Tests June 2025 Support\nEthereum's\nprice, unlike the three charts mentioned above, is also falling for the third\nconsecutive session, deepening this year's lows on Thursday to $2,068—the\nlowest value since May 2025.\nSupport\ndesignated by June 2024 lows around $2,100 continues to hold\nprice in check, and today we also see a reaction at this level. As a result,\nETH is currently losing only 0.7% and changing hands at $2,132.\nAlthough\nbearish pressure persists, even if the current support breaks, the next support\nsits around $1,760 (March 2025 lows), and the final ultimate\nlevel around $1,400 (April 2024 yearly lows).\nAccording\nto my technical analysis, Ethereum prices could fall to $1,725 or lower\nin February, aligning with the inverted cup and handle downside target,\nwhich historically achieves its expected target with an 82% success rate.\nI'll\nabandon bearish scenarios when ETH returns at least to the consolidation range\ndrawn from November to the end of January, between $2,750 and $3,430.\nWhy Is Crypto Crashing\nToday?\n$775 Million Liquidation\nCascade\nThursday's\ncrypto crash triggered a massive $775 million liquidation event across\nmajor exchanges as Bitcoin plunged to $70,000. What began as a minor technical\ncorrection \"accelerated into a mass capitulation of long positions,\"\naccording to market analysis.\nThe violent\nflush caught leverage traders off guard, with open interest ballooning\nto unsustainable levels over the past week driven by retail FOMO and\naggressive perpetual positioning. When the floor gave way, algorithmic selling\npressure was instantaneous.\nRecent data\nshows over $800 million in leveraged liquidations impacting\naround 165,000 traders, with the majority coming from long positions. This\nfollows the February 1 \"Black Sunday II\" event that saw $2.2\nbillion liquidated in 24 hours, the largest single-day wipeout since\nOctober 2025.\nHawkish Federal Reserve\nPolicy\n\"The\nrecent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has been swift and severe, with\nanalysts attributing the decline to the appointment of Kevin Warsh as the\nprospective chair of the Federal Reserve, amid expectations that he might\nreduce the Fed's balance sheet,\" according to Reuters.\nSigns of\nongoing high interest rates have pushed the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)\nabove 97.5, making investors less interested in riskier assets like\nBitcoin. The Fed's January 28 hold at 3.50-3.75% with Powell stating he's\n\"not in a hurry to cut\" continued to weigh on risk assets, with real\nyields remaining elevated.\nInstitutional Outflows\nAccelerate\nBig\ninvestors such as BlackRock have sold large amounts of Bitcoin, with $373.8\nmillion leaving spot BTC ETFs recently. Bitcoin ETFs have continued\nbleeding with cumulative multi-billion dollar outflows since mid-January,\nremoving spot bid support and forcing correlated selling in leveraged products.\nTechnical Targets Table\nWith clear\nbreaks below key support levels across major cryptocurrencies, here are my next\ntechnical targets:\nCrypto Price Analysis, FAQ\nWhy is crypto falling\ntoday?\nCrypto\ncrashed for the third consecutive session on February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin\ntesting $70,000 (lowest since Nov 2024), triggering $775 million in\nliquidations. Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair appointment raised expectations for\nbalance sheet reduction and hawkish policy, pushing DXY above 97.5 and making\nrisk assets less attractive. \nHow low can Bitcoin go?\nBitcoin\nbroke my November target of $74,000 and tested $70,052 before recovering to\n$71,340. The next technical target is $68,000 where the 200-week EMA provides\ncritical support, with an ultra-bearish scenario targeting $52,000 (100%\nFibonacci extension). Analysts Peter Brandt and Michael Burry identify support\nlevels at $60,176 and $47,824 if $70,000 breaks. LMAX's Joel Kruger notes\nBitcoin is \"roughly 45% below its October peak\" with \"hallmarks\nof capitulation now in place.\"\nWhy is XRP crashing?\nXRP crashed\nover 7% on Thursday to below $1.40—the lowest since November 2024 excluding\nOctober's flash crash. Breaking April 2025 local support opens the path to\n$1.25-1.26 (October flash crash lows), with the long-term ultra-bearish target\nat $0.53. Bull invalidation requires a return above $2.20 where the 200-day EMA\ncurrently sits, representing a 57% rally from current levels.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:Tf609,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2026-02-05T12:43:30.027+02:00 T h u r s d a y , 0 5 / 0 2 / 2 0 2 6 | 1 0 : 4 3 G M T by Damian Chmiel Cryptocurrency markets plunged for the third consecutive session on February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin testing $70,000.

In this article I analyze XRP/USDT, BTC/USD, ETH/USDT and DOGE/USDT charts, answering the question of why crypto is going down today. Why Bitcoin Is Going Down? Breaking Through $74K Opens Path to $68K Bitcoin's price fell for the third straight session, dropping 3.5% to test $70,052 , the lowest since November 2024, before recovering to $71,340, down 1.5%. This represents a decisive break below my target range of $74,000 that I've been discussing since November. While I forecasted a potential bounce at $74,000 , I practice reactive analysis rather than wishful thinking analysis , which means I was prepared for this scenario as well. With the breakdown confirmed, I'm now targeting $68,000 , where the 200-week exponential moving average (200 WMA) runs on the weekly chart. That's where I'll expect a demand reaction. If that level also fails to hold, I have my long-term ultra-bearish target around $52,000 , where the 100% Fibonacci extension based on the current trend lands. One thing is certain: pressure on cryptocurrencies continues to persist . Bitcoin is now approximately 45% below its October peak near $126,000, with the recent drawdown accelerating as expectations that BTC would never revisit sub-$100K levels were shattered. Why Bitcoin price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com Joel Kruger, crypto strategist at LMAX, offers perspective on the brutal selloff while identifying potential bottoming signals. \"Price action across crypto has been undeniably heavy over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin acting as the primary drag on broader sentiment and ETH following suit,\" Kruger notes. However, he points to emerging signs of exhaustion. Follow me on X for more crypto market analysis: @ChmielDk XRP Price Analysis: Testing $1.40 Opens Path to $1.25 or $0.53 XRP is also falling for the third consecutive session, and today is one of the strongest declines this year, losing over 7% and testing levels below $1.40 . If we exclude October's flash crash, this is the lowest value since November 2024. Breaking the local support defined by April 2025 lows opens the path toward targets in the $1.25-1.26 range , the minimums from the aforementioned flash crash. If this level also fails to hold, I'm targeting just $0.53 on the XRP chart. Why XRP price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com What would need to happen for me to change my bearish stance? Such scenarios are really far away, XRP would need to return above $2.20 , where the 200-day EMA currently sits. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Fighting $0.10 Support Dogecoin ( DOGE ), like BTC and XRP, is falling for the third consecutive session and is fighting with local support around the round level of $0.10 , which coincides with the lowest levels since September 2024. Doge already broke its important support at the end of January, located just below $0.12 , and is currently in short-term consolidation at medium-term lows. Bearish pressure remains strong here, and breaking this level will open the path to declines toward 2024 minimums around $0.08 . Why Dogecoin price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com To relieve pressure from Dogecoin's shoulders, we would need to wait until around $0.16 , where the 200 EMA sits. Ethereum Price Analysis: $2,068 Tests June 2025 Support Ethereum's price, unlike the three charts mentioned above, is also falling for the third consecutive session, deepening this year's lows on Thursday to $2,068 —the lowest value since May 2025. Support designated by June 2024 lows around $2,100 continues to hold price in check, and today we also see a reaction at this level. As a result, ETH is currently losing only 0.7% and changing hands at $2,132 . Why Ethereum price is going down? Source: Tradingview.com Although bearish pressure persists, even if the current support breaks, the next support sits around $1,760 (March 2025 lows), and the final ultimate level around $1,400 (April 2024 yearly lows). According to my technical analysis, Ethereum prices could fall to $1,725 or lower in February , aligning with the inverted cup and handle downside target, which historically achieves its expected target with an 82% success rate. I'll abandon bearish scenarios when ETH returns at least to the consolidation range drawn from November to the end of January, between $2,750 and $3,430 . Why Is Crypto Crashing Today? $775 Million Liquidation Cascade Thursday's crypto crash triggered a massive $775 million liquidation event across major exchanges as Bitcoin plunged to $70,000. What began as a minor technical correction \"accelerated into a mass capitulation of long positions,\" according to market analysis. The violent flush caught leverage traders off guard, with open interest ballooning to unsustainable levels over the past week driven by retail FOMO and aggressive perpetual positioning. When the floor gave way, algorithmic selling pressure was instantaneous. Recent data shows over $800 million in leveraged liquidations impacting around 165,000 traders, with the majority coming from long positions. This follows the February 1 \"Black Sunday II\" event that saw $2.2 billion liquidated in 24 hours, the largest single-day wipeout since October 2025. Hawkish Federal Reserve Policy \"The recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has been swift and severe, with analysts attributing the decline to the appointment of Kevin Warsh as the prospective chair of the Federal Reserve, amid expectations that he might reduce the Fed's balance sheet,\" according to Reuters. Signs of ongoing high interest rates have pushed the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) above 97.5 , making investors less interested in riskier assets like Bitcoin. The Fed's January 28 hold at 3.50-3.75% with Powell stating he's \"not in a hurry to cut\" continued to weigh on risk assets, with real yields remaining elevated. Institutional Outflows Accelerate Big investors such as BlackRock have sold large amounts of Bitcoin, with $373.8 million leaving spot BTC ETFs recently. Bitcoin ETFs have continued bleeding with cumulative multi-billion dollar outflows since mid-January, removing spot bid support and forcing correlated selling in leveraged products. Technical Targets Table With clear breaks below key support levels across major cryptocurrencies, here are my next technical targets: Crypto Current Price Next Target Ultra-Bearish Target Bull Invalidation Bitcoin $71,340 $68,000 (200-week EMA) $52,000 (100% Fib) Above $84,000 XRP Below $1.40 $1.25-1.26 (Oct flash crash) $0.53 (long-term) Above $2.20 (200 EMA) Ethereum $2,132 $1,760 (Mar 2025 lows) $1,400 (Apr 2024 lows) $2,750-3,430 range Dogecoin $0.10 $0.08 (2024 lows) N/A Above $0.16 (200 EMA) Crypto Price Analysis, FAQ Why is crypto falling today? Crypto crashed for the third consecutive session on February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin testing $70,000 (lowest since Nov 2024), triggering $775 million in liquidations. Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair appointment raised expectations for balance sheet reduction and hawkish policy, pushing DXY above 97.5 and making risk assets less attractive. How low can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin broke my November target of $74,000 and tested $70,052 before recovering to $71,340. The next technical target is $68,000 where the 200-week EMA provides critical support, with an ultra-bearish scenario targeting $52,000 (100% Fibonacci extension). Analysts Peter Brandt and Michael Burry identify support levels at $60,176 and $47,824 if $70,000 breaks. LMAX's Joel Kruger notes Bitcoin is \"roughly 45% below its October peak\" with \"hallmarks of capitulation now in place.\" Why is XRP crashing? XRP crashed over 7% on Thursday to below $1.40—the lowest since November 2024 excluding October's flash crash. Breaking April 2025 local support opens the path to $1.25-1.26 (October flash crash lows), with the long-term ultra-bearish target at $0.53. Bull invalidation requires a return above $2.20 where the 200-day EMA currently sits, representing a 57% rally from current levels.

We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Bitcoin fell over 3% to test the $70,000 mark, decisively breaking the $74,000 support level, while altcoins like XRP, Ethereum, and Dogecoin also hit significant lows. Technical analysis suggests further downside potential, with Bitcoin targeting $68,000 or even $52,000, and XRP facing potential declines toward $0.53 if support levels fail to hold.\\nThe selloff accelerated into a \\\"mass capitulation\\\" of long positions, fueled by unsustainable leverage and retail FOMO following the recent \\\"Black Sunday II\\\" event. Analysts identify critical support levels for Ethereum around $2,100 and Dogecoin at $0.10, warning that breaking these thresholds could lead to deeper corrections. Market sentiment remains bearish as traders adjust to the reality that sub-$100,000 Bitcoin levels are back in play after the recent peak near $126,000.\",\"aiSummaryThai\":\"ในวันพฤหัสบดีที่ 5 กุมภาพันธ์ 2026 ตลาดคริปโตสั่นคลอนเป็นวันที่สามติดต่อกัน จนนำไปสู่เหตุการณ์ Liquidation ครั้งใหญ่มูลค่า 775 ล้านดอลลาร์ ราคา Bitcoin ร่วงลงกว่า 3% มาทดสอบระดับ 70,000 ดอลลาร์ โดยหักเลาะผ่านแนวรับสำคัญที่ 74,000 ดอลลาร์อย่างชัดเจน ขณะที่ Altcoin เช่น XRP, Ethereum และ Dogecoin ก็ตกต่ำถึงระดับสำคัญเช่นกัน การวิเคราะห์ทางเทคนิคบ่งชี้ถึงแนวโน้มขาลงที่อาจดำเนินต่อไป โดยมีเป้าหมายถัดไปของ Bitcoin อยู่ที่ 68,000 หรือ 52,000 ดอลลาร์ และ XRP มีโอกาสร่วงลงสู่ระดับ 0.53 ดอลลาร์\\nแรงขายที่รุนแรงเกิดขึ้นจากการถอยทัพของผู้ถือสถานะ Long (Mass Capitulation) ซึ่งได้รับแรงหนุนจาก Leverage ที่สูงเกินไปและกระแส FOMO หลังเหตุการณ์ \\\"Black Sunday II\\\" นักวิเคราะห์ระบุว่าหาก Ethereum หักเลาะผ่านแนวรับ 2,100 ดอลลาร์ และ Dogecoin ผ่านระดับ 0.10 ดอลลาร์ ราคาอาจปรับตัวลงลึกกว่านี้ ภาพรวมตลาดยังคงมีแนวโน้มเชิงลง (Bearish) เมื่อนักเทรดต้องปรับตัวหลังจากที่ความคาดหวังที่ว่า Bitcoin จะไม่กลับไปต่ำกว่า 100,000 ดอลลาร์ถูกพังทลายลงแล้ว\",\"fullContent\":\"$11\",\"keyPoints\":[\"Bitcoin broke below $74,000 support to test $70,000, triggering $775 million in long liquidations.\",\"Technical analysis identifies downside targets for BTC at $68,000, XRP at $0.53, and ETH at $1,760.\",\"The crash follows \\\"Black Sunday II\\\" and is driven by the unwinding of excessive leverage and bearish technical breakouts.\"],\"scrapingStatus\":\"scraped\",\"wordCount\":9425},\"relatedArticles\":[{\"_id\":\"6986d59738f2116917d8f81c\",\"category\":\"defi\",\"pubDate\":\"2026-02-07T06:02:15.000Z\",\"slug\":\"flakeexchange-a-faster-way-to-swap-and-bridge-crypto-cross-chain\",\"source\":\"Coinpedia\",\"title\":\"Flake.exchange: A Faster Way to Swap and Bridge Crypto Cross-Chain\",\"translatedTitle\":\"Flake.exchange: วิธีการแลกเปลี่ยนและเชื่อมโยง Crypto ข้าม Chain ที่เร็วขึ้น\"},{\"_id\":\"6986d59638f2116917d8f818\",\"category\":\"bitcoin\",\"pubDate\":\"2026-02-07T06:00:38.000Z\",\"slug\":\"bitcoin-is-maras-87m-btc-move-more-evidence-of-miner-distress\",\"source\":\"AMBCrypto\",\"title\":\"Bitcoin – Is MARA’s $87M BTC move more evidence of miner distress?\",\"translatedTitle\":\"Bitcoin – การย้าย BTC มูลค่า 87 ล้านดอลลาร์ของ MARA เป็นหลักฐานของความวิบัติของเหมืองหายใช่ไหม?\"},{\"_id\":\"6986d52438f2116917d8e575\",\"category\":\"bitcoin\",\"pubDate\":\"2026-02-07T06:00:03.000Z\",\"slug\":\"bitcoin-whale-inflows-to-binance-hit-highest-level-since-2022-distribution-or-re\",\"source\":\"Bitcoinist\",\"title\":\"Bitcoin Whale Inflows To Binance Hit Highest Level Since 2022: Distribution Or Repositioning?\",\"translatedTitle\":\"Bitcoin Whale Inflows To Binance Hit Highest Level Since 2022: Distribution Or Repositioning?\"},{\"_id\":\"6986d4f538f2116917d8e34f\",\"category\":\"altcoins\",\"pubDate\":\"2026-02-07T05:56:18.000Z\",\"slug\":\"decred-dcr-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-will-decred-price-hit-1000\",\"source\":\"Coinpedia\",\"title\":\"Decred (DCR) Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Will Decred Price Hit $1000?\",\"translatedTitle\":\"การคาดการณ์ราคา Decred (DCR) 2026, 2027 – 2030: ราคา Decred จะเข้าถึง $1000 ได้ไหม?\"}]}],\"$L12\"]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"12:[\"$\",\"footer\",null,{\"className\":\"site-footer\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"container\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"footer-inner\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"footer-text\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"children\":\"Cryptonews.in.th\"}],\" // Crypto Intelligence Feed\"]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"footer-meta\",\"children\":\"22+ Sources · Auto-Updated\"}]]}]}]}]\n"])</script></body></html>
