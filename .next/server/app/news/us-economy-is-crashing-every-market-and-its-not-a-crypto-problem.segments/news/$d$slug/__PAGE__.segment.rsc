4:T15f9,Markets sold off together as crypto, gold, and stocks fell in a forced deleveraging move driven by liquidity stress, not asset-specific weakness. Fed actions failed to calm investors because halting QT and buying T-bills support financial plumbing, not risk assets or borrowing costs. Weak US labor signals without rate-cut relief left markets trapped between slowing growth and still-tight financial conditions, extending volatility. Global markets sold off sharply this week, hitting cryptocurrencies, equities, and even traditional safe havens like gold and silver. The synchronized decline points to a broader liquidity shock rather than asset-specific weakness. Bitcoin led losses in risk assets, while gold and silver posted their steepest weekly drops in months. The unusual correlation signals forced de-risking across portfolios, not a shift in investor preference. Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver Price Charts Over the Past Week. Source: TradingView Sponsored Sponsored A Liquidity Squeeze, Not a Rotation Normally, stress in crypto pushes capital toward gold or cash. This time, investors sold everything that could be sold. That pattern typically emerges when leverage unwinds. Traders facing margin calls liquidate liquid assets first, including Bitcoin, gold, and silver . The selling is mechanical, not ideological. Fed Actions Failed to Calm Markets At the center of the turmoil is confusion around US monetary conditions . The Federal Reserve halted quantitative tightening in December and began buying short-dated Treasury bills to stabilize bank reserves. When the Fed halted QT, it stopped actively draining cash from the financial system. For banks, this means reserve levels are no longer shrinking. For households and businesses, it reduces the risk of sudden funding stress in the banking system. December's US Producer Price Index (PPI) was just released. Over the past year, the PPI is up by a TROUBLING 3.0%/yr. With the Fed's pivot away from Quantitative Tightening to Quantitative Easing, its having trouble putting the INFLATION GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE. pic.twitter.com/jgP8pPYfin — Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) February 1, 2026 By buying short-term government debt, the Fed ensures banks have enough cash to meet daily funding needs and keep money markets functioning smoothly. Sponsored Sponsored These actions support the financial system’s plumbing, not market prices. They do not lower borrowing costs for consumers, reduce mortgage rates, or encourage risk-taking. Long-term interest rates remain elevated, and financial conditions remain restrictive. As a result, markets interpreted the move as a sign of underlying stress rather than relief. Jobs Data Added Pressure Instead of Clarity US labor data released this week deepened uncertainty. Job openings continued to fall. Hiring slowed. Layoffs rose. Consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level since 2014. At the same time, unemployment remains relatively low and inflation has not cooled enough to justify rapid rate cuts. This left markets trapped between slowing growth and tight financial conditions. Sponsored Sponsored Why Gold and Silver Fell with Crypto Gold and silver declined despite rising uncertainty because investors needed cash. Both assets had rallied strongly earlier this year, making them easy sources of liquidity. In addition, real yields remained elevated and the dollar strengthened during the sell-off. That combination removed short-term support for precious metals. Cryptocurrencies fell more sharply because they sit at the bottom of the liquidity hierarchy. When leverage unwinds, crypto is sold first. This is absolutely SHOCKING Bitcoin has crashed by -$56,700 in the last 120 days. It’s now down 45% from its peak of $126k to $69.4k. That’s a $14,000 dump every single month for the last four months. It’s insane because there is no major event or news that could explain this. https://t.co/8evlh4hZi7 pic.twitter.com/tRSz0ydUy2 — Bull Theory (@BullTheoryio) February 5, 2026 Bitcoin derivatives data showed long positioning had built up in recent weeks. As prices dropped, liquidations accelerated. ETF inflows slowed at the same time, reducing demand. Sponsored Sponsored A Broader Market Reset is Underway The last two weeks reflect a single theme: markets priced in easier conditions too early. Liquidity did not expand fast enough to support those bets. As a result, risk assets corrected together. The move reset positioning across crypto, equities, and commodities. 10/10 really broke the market. Things were going to plan. Entire market structure reset is now happening. Good theories all over why it happened but what's important is to not give up on the ideals that got us here. Just kinda sad that it happened. Delayed the fun. pic.twitter.com/CvCOiCT0zA — Adam 💫 (@MyStandard_Adam) February 4, 2026 What this Means Going Forward This sell-off does not signal a failure of Bitcoin or gold as long-term hedges. It reflects a short-term liquidity stress phase that often appears before policy or macro clarity improves. For now, markets remain fragile. Until liquidity expectations stabilize or economic data decisively weaken, volatility is likely to persist.
