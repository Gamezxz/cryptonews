Remittix gains attention with live utility and 300% bonus, attracting selective investors amid market turbulence. Summary Remittix leads the crypto rotation with live PayFi utility, a 300% bonus, and $28.9m raised in private funding. Built on Ethereum, Remittix targets $19 trillion cross-border payments, enabling real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers globally. Investor confidence rises as Remittix completes CertiK audit, ranks top on Skynet, and secures BitMart and LBank listings. This week in Crypto has been characterized by heavy selling on centralized exchanges as Bitcoin dropped to new lows in 2026 following the violation of key support levels. Risk appetite has calmed down a lot, and fund managers of top institutions are also rebalancing their portfolios as macroeconomic challenges continue to hit many digital assets. The majority of altcoins have followed the same free-fall Bitcoin has shown, and with correction taking place, capital flows now paint a more stratified image. An increasing number of investors are choosing to place selective investments in projects that show real progress, solid schedules, and strong asymmetric potential. One name now dominating that rotation is Remittix , a PayFi-focused Ethereum protocol that is rapidly gaining attention thanks to a rare combination of live utility and a time-limited 300% bonus window that analysts say materially changes the short-term risk-reward profile. Remittix’s PayFi model is built for real adoption, not market cycles Remittix is positioning itself squarely at the intersection of crypto and real-world finance. Built on Ethereum, the protocol is here to bridge the inefficiencies that businesses and individuals encounter when trying to send money internationally. The top Defi project is on course to become one of the biggest players in the $19 trillion global cross-border payments market, enabling direct crypto-to-fiat transfers with real-time settlement to bank accounts in 30+ countries, providing real-time utility to businesses, merchants, and individual clients. This execution-only strategy is among the reasons why investor interest has been so strong despite the broader markets retreating. Strong backing has also helped boost confidence. According to recent reports, Remittix has already raised over $28.9 million in private capital, which reflects continued involvement of institutional and high-net-worth investors. On the exchange front, listings on BitMart and LBank are already confirmed, with additional centralized exchange discussions reportedly ongoing. From a security standpoint, the project has completed a full CertiK audit and currently holds a leading pre-launch ranking on CertiK Skynet , adding an independent layer of credibility at a time when trust matters. Remittix latest bonus incentive fuels aggressive capital influx While infrastructure and adoption underpin the long-term thesis, near-term momentum around Remittix is being driven by its active deposit incentive tied to the native RTX token. According to official project updates, participants can receive up to a 300% bonus on qualifying deposits, one of the most aggressive incentive structures currently available in the market. This dynamic is why some analysts suggest scenarios where relatively modest capital allocations can be meaningfully amplified during the campaign window. With the bonus applied, a $5,000 deposit can translate into substantially higher effective token exposure, creating a setup that many market commentators have described as unusually favorable under current conditions. Additional factors reinforcing momentum include: Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank Live crypto-to-fiat settlement across 30+ countries A growing and active global holder community A functional Remittix wallet is already live A clear roadmap centered on measurable PayFi adoption February 9, 2026 PayFi launch anchors the long-term thesis Beyond the bonus-driven surge, Remittix has confirmed that its full PayFi platform will officially go live on February 9 , 2026. That milestone provides a concrete timeline, something increasingly valued as markets mature and speculative narratives lose favor. As volatility reshapes capital allocation strategies, investors are becoming more selective. Projects with audited security, working products, exchange access, and real-world relevance are increasingly separated from the noise. With its PayFi infrastructure already live and a limited-time bonus amplifying early exposure, Remittix is being framed less as a short-term trade and more as a calculated positioning play ahead of broader adoption.
