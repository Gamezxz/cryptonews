While activity on the XRP Ledger is soaring toward all-time highs, the price of XRP itself is fighting to stay afloat, making it one of the most contradictory market conditions in recent months. Rather than validating strength, this divergence is causing significant uncertainty about the asset's potential future direction . Momentum just vanished In terms of price, XRP is still trading below important moving averages after clearly breaking below its declining channel support. Although the daily RSI is still hovering around oversold territory and momentum indicators are still weak, buyers have not demonstrated a strong desire to intervene, and the recent decline toward the $1.40 area indicates that bullish momentum has virtually completely vanished, making the market susceptible to additional declines. XRP/USDT Chart by TradingView Simultaneously, data from the XRP Ledger indicates that transaction volumes and payment counts are returning to previous highs. Increased network activity is typically seen as a positive indication of adoption or rekindled demand . Context is important, though this increase in activity seems to be associated with increased selling pressure rather than accumulation in the current environment. HOT Stories Crypto market dives deep While transaction costs and settlement speeds are still favorable, it appears that both large holders and retail participants are using network liquidity to offload their positions. Increased transfer activity during a downtrend frequently indicates that money is leaving the asset rather than coming in, which supports the pessimistic view. You Might Also Like Additionally, the larger technical structure is still brittle. Previous support levels are now serving as resistance, and XRP is still trading below key trend indicators . Any short-term recovery runs the risk of turning into just another relief rally inside an ongoing downtrend if the $1.60-$1.70 zone is not firmly reclaimed. In the future, if sentiment on the cryptocurrency market declines once more, the situation may worsen. If buyers do not quickly regain control, the combination of ongoing selling pressure and already shaky technical support could lead to more significant corrections. Theledger for XRP may be active right now, but the price action paints a more somber picture: participation is high but confidence seems to be ebbing, and unless market conditions change rapidly, the asset may continue to struggle in the sessions to come.0:{"buildId":"rPzjts34cPPlDL88LESzh","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853ae438f2116917acbb8d","guid":"https://u.today/xrp-ledger-close-to-all-time-highs-as-xrp-price-is-barely-breathing","__v":0,"author":"Arman Shirinyan","categories":["altcoins"],"category":"altcoins","content":"XRP Ledger's activity is through the roof despite the catastrophic price performance of XRP on the market.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:44.058Z","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/100102.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:44.059Z","link":"https://u.today/xrp-ledger-close-to-all-time-highs-as-xrp-price-is-barely-breathing","pubDate":"2026-02-05T10:55:00.000Z","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"XRP Ledger กำลังมีกิจกรร","title":"XRP Ledger Close to All-Time Highs as XRP Price Is Barely Breathing","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T23:22:19.519Z","sentiment":"bearish","translatedContent":"กิจกรรมบน XRP Ledger พุ่งสูงขึ้นอย่างมาก แม้จะมีผลการดำเนินงานด้านราคาของ XRP ที่ล้มเหลวอย่างหนักในตลาด","translatedTitle":"XRP Ledger ใกล้จะสู่ระดับสูงสุดตลอดกาล ในขณะที่ราคา XRP เกือบหยุดหายใจ","slug":"xrp-ledger-close-to-all-time-highs-as-xrp-price-is-barely-breathing","fullContent":"$4","scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":458},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986841238f2116917d57493","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:01:00.000Z","slug":"crypto-market-review-500000000-in-xrp-buying-volume-shiba-inu-shib-surprisingly-","source":"U.Today","title":"Crypto Market Review: $500,000,000 in XRP Buying Volume, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Surprisingly Bullish, Will Bitcoin (BTC) Be Saved Before $50,000?","translatedTitle":"รีวิวตลาดคริปโต: ปริมาณการซื้อ XRP ครั้งใหญ่ 500 ล้านดอลลาร์, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ทำกำไรได้น่าตื่นเต้น, Bitcoin (BTC) จะหลบหลีกจากการตกลงถึง 50,000 หรือไม่?"},{"_id":"69866ca238f2116917d44e1e","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-06T22:30:15.000Z","slug":"ethereum-derivatives-data-shows-heavy-positioning-near-2000","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Ethereum Derivatives Data Shows Heavy Positioning Near $2,000","translatedTitle":"ข้อมูล Derivatives ของ Ethereum แสดงให้เห็นการวางตำแหน่งหนาแน่นใกล้ระดับ $2,000"},{"_id":"69865c3938f2116917d36d35","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:20:34.000Z","slug":"xrp-rebounds-as-whale-accumulation-and-network-activity-signal-price-reversal","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"XRP Rebounds as Whale Accumulation and Network Activity Signal Price Reversal","translatedTitle":"XRP ดีดตัวขึ้นเมื่อ Whale Accumulation และกิจกรรมเครือข่ายส่งสัญญาณการกลับตัวของราคา"},{"_id":"698658b738f2116917d34770","category":"defi","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:02:13.000Z","slug":"ripple-integrating-hyperliquid-into-its-prime-brokerage-platform-to-broaden-inst","source":"ZyCrypto","title":"Ripple Integrating Hyperliquid Into Its Prime Brokerage Platform To Broaden Institutional DeFi Access Fails To Bump XRP Bulls","translatedTitle":"Ripple ผนวก Hyperliquid เข้ากับแพลตฟอร์ม Prime Brokerage เพื่อขยายการเข้าถึง DeFi สำหรับสถาบัน แต่ก็ไม่สามารถกระตุ้น XRP ขึ้นได้"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
