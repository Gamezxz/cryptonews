While activity on the XRP Ledger is soaring toward all-time highs, the price of XRP itself is fighting to stay afloat, making it one of the most contradictory market conditions in recent months. Rather than validating strength, this divergence is causing significant uncertainty about the asset's potential future direction . Momentum just vanished In terms of price, XRP is still trading below important moving averages after clearly breaking below its declining channel support. Although the daily RSI is still hovering around oversold territory and momentum indicators are still weak, buyers have not demonstrated a strong desire to intervene, and the recent decline toward the $1.40 area indicates that bullish momentum has virtually completely vanished, making the market susceptible to additional declines. XRP/USDT Chart by TradingView Simultaneously, data from the XRP Ledger indicates that transaction volumes and payment counts are returning to previous highs. Increased network activity is typically seen as a positive indication of adoption or rekindled demand . Context is important, though this increase in activity seems to be associated with increased selling pressure rather than accumulation in the current environment. HOT Stories Crypto market dives deep While transaction costs and settlement speeds are still favorable, it appears that both large holders and retail participants are using network liquidity to offload their positions. Increased transfer activity during a downtrend frequently indicates that money is leaving the asset rather than coming in, which supports the pessimistic view. You Might Also Like Additionally, the larger technical structure is still brittle. Previous support levels are now serving as resistance, and XRP is still trading below key trend indicators . Any short-term recovery runs the risk of turning into just another relief rally inside an ongoing downtrend if the $1.60-$1.70 zone is not firmly reclaimed. In the future, if sentiment on the cryptocurrency market declines once more, the situation may worsen. If buyers do not quickly regain control, the combination of ongoing selling pressure and already shaky technical support could lead to more significant corrections. Theledger for XRP may be active right now, but the price action paints a more somber picture: participation is high but confidence seems to be ebbing, and unless market conditions change rapidly, the asset may continue to struggle in the sessions to come.0:{"buildId":"Lop84034c2cxeM48hSGQq","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853ae438f2116917acbb8d","guid":"https://u.today/xrp-ledger-close-to-all-time-highs-as-xrp-price-is-barely-breathing","__v":0,"author":"Arman Shirinyan","categories":["altcoins"],"category":"altcoins","content":"XRP Ledger's activity is through the roof despite the catastrophic price performance of XRP on the market.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:44.058Z","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/100102.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:44.059Z","link":"https://u.today/xrp-ledger-close-to-all-time-highs-as-xrp-price-is-barely-breathing","pubDate":"2026-02-05T10:55:00.000Z","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"XRP Ledger กำลังมีกิจกรร","title":"XRP Ledger Close to All-Time Highs as XRP Price Is Barely Breathing","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T23:22:19.519Z","sentiment":"bearish","translatedContent":"กิจกรรมบน XRP Ledger พุ่งสูงขึ้นอย่างมาก แม้จะมีผลการดำเนินงานด้านราคาของ XRP ที่ล้มเหลวอย่างหนักในตลาด","translatedTitle":"XRP Ledger ใกล้จะสู่ระดับสูงสุดตลอดกาล ในขณะที่ราคา XRP เกือบหยุดหายใจ","slug":"xrp-ledger-close-to-all-time-highs-as-xrp-price-is-barely-breathing","fullContent":"$4","scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":458},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986d4f538f2116917d8e34f","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:56:18.000Z","slug":"decred-dcr-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-will-decred-price-hit-1000","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Decred (DCR) Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Will Decred Price Hit $1000?","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคา Decred (DCR) 2026, 2027 – 2030: ราคา Decred จะเข้าถึง $1000 ได้ไหม?"},{"_id":"6986cf1438f2116917d87744","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:59.000Z","slug":"bitrue-expands-xrp-infrastructure-as-10-new-rlusd-pairs-go-live","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Bitrue Expands XRP Infrastructure as 10 New RLUSD Pairs Go Live","translatedTitle":"Bitrue ขยายโครงสร้าง XRP เมื่อ 10 คู่ใหม่ของ RLUSD เปิดใช้งาน"},{"_id":"6986d16c38f2116917d8b420","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:00.000Z","slug":"xrp-still-in-bull-market-versus-bitcoin-and-xrpbtc-chart-puts-51-upside-on-the-m","source":"U.Today","title":"XRP Still in Bull Market Versus Bitcoin, and XRP/BTC Chart Puts 51% Upside on the Menu","translatedTitle":"XRP ยังอยู่ในตลาดเพชรฟองต่อบิทคอยน์ และแผนภูมิ XRP/BTC มีศักยภาพเพิ่มขึ้น 51%"},{"_id":"6986d04238f2116917d89c1a","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:22:24.000Z","slug":"infinite-possibilities-announces-upcoming-launch-of-proof-of-activity-dex-and-ip","source":"CoinJournal","title":"Infinite Possibilities announces upcoming launch of Proof-of-Activity DEX and IP Membership program","translatedTitle":"Infinite Possibility ประกาศเปิดตัว DEX แบบ Proof-of-Activity และโปรแกรม IP Membership ในอนาคต"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
