10:T18c4,Russia is tightening access conditions for the digital ruble , adding extra identification hurdles just as authorities prepare for the national rollout of the central bank currency. Summary Bank of Russia updates requirements for opening accounts Restrictions on citizen use and expanded professional access Mass adoption plans and phased rollout of Russia’s CBDC Economic expectations and adoption uncertainties Bank of Russia updates requirements for opening accounts The Bank of Russia has approved new rules for opening digital ruble accounts , significantly expanding the information that applicants must provide. The changes affect both ordinary citizens and small businesses, and they are expected to complicate initial access to the platform. Under the revised rules, individuals and sole proprietors must now submit their taxpayer identification numbers and social security numbers directly to the regulator. Moreover, this data requirement is in addition to existing KYC checks performed by commercial banks. The regulation also obliges applicants to register with Russia’s Unified Identification and Authentication System (ESIA) . This state system underpins access to a wide range of public services, including those offered via the Gosuslugi portal, which has become central to Russia’s digital bureaucracy. To complete the process, future users have to appear in person at an ESIA point of service and obtain a unique electronic signature key. However, this in-person step may slow onboarding, particularly for residents in remote regions and for small entrepreneurs with limited time. Restrictions on citizen use and expanded professional access Russian crypto media , including Bits.media , highlighted the updated rules on Friday, when the amendments to the regulation governing the CBDC platform were officially published. The new text specifies how Russian citizens are allowed to use their regular accounts. According to the document, standard accounts of private individuals can only be used for non-business transactions. However, this explicit restriction means that citizens are formally barred from using these wallets for commercial activity, even if volumes are modest. That said, self-employed persons who are not registered as sole proprietors will still be permitted to conduct transfers tied to their professional activities. This carve-out is intended to accommodate Russia’s rapidly growing segment of freelancers and gig workers. In addition to self-employed citizens and individual entrepreneurs, the regulation broadens the list of professionals allowed to use CBDC accounts for work-related payments. Notaries, lawyers, patent attorneys, mediators, insolvency agents and appraisers are now all explicitly included in the group of users with access for professional purposes. The tighter wording does not change the regime for other types of digital ruble accounts, such as those held by legal entities, including companies, banks and non-bank organizations. However, branches of these institutions will not be allowed to open separate CBDC accounts, which may centralize corporate usage at the head-office level. Mass adoption plans and phased rollout of Russia’s CBDC The project to issue the Russian ruble in digital form has been underway for several years. Trials of the platform with a limited circle of participants began in 2023 , and the pilot has been gradually expanded as more banks and users joined. A full-scale launch of the state-backed coin was initially targeted for 2025 . However, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) later postponed this deadline to give financial institutions and businesses extra time to upgrade their infrastructure and compliance systems. Following a call from President Vladimir Putin in the spring of last year for mass adoption of the CBDC, the monetary authority moved to accelerate its roadmap. Lawmakers in Moscow subsequently approved a new timetable that breaks the introduction into several stages. Under the current plan, the first phase is scheduled to start on September 1, 2026 . At that point, Russia’s largest banks will be required to support transactions in the digital form of the national currency for their clients, both retail and corporate. Officials at the Bank of Russia describe the CBDC as a third form of the ruble, alongside cash and traditional bank money. Moreover, some within the institution believe it could eventually capture up to 5% of non-cash payments in the country, assuming technology and user experience prove robust. Economic expectations and adoption uncertainties Despite official optimism, there is still no consensus inside the CBR or among lawmakers about how quickly Russians will embrace the new platform. While some predict rapid take-up driven by government services and mandatory integration, others expect a more cautious transition. Advisor Kirill Tremasov , who works closely with CBR Governor Elvira Nabiullina , argues that the main benefits will emerge in the public sector and for the wider Russian economy. According to estimates released in August, the digital ruble could add up to $3.3 billion annually to economic output once fully implemented. However, the increased documentation demands, in-person ESIA registration and activity-based restrictions on retail accounts may slow user onboarding in the early years. How quickly citizens, professionals and businesses adapt to the new rails will likely determine whether the CBDC meets those economic expectations. In summary, Russia is moving toward a phased national rollout of its state-backed digital currency, but stricter access requirements and usage limits may shape the pace and profile of adoption across the country.
