f:T1e37,Story Highlights Bitcoin is currently trading at: $ 65,545.24486647 Predictions suggest BTC to hit $150K to $250K before 2026 ends. Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction 2026 is becoming increasingly bullish as the 2025’s second half comes to a close soon, with all-time highs of $125K reached this year as the highest point. As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop. The year was marked by optimism, driven by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, skyrocketing institutional adoption, clearer regulations, and unwavering political support. There were several macro downturns, too, that capped BTC’s uptrend, like trade tariffs and wars. Despite that, BTC holds its level, making it now seen as “a hedge against inflation” more than ever. Major players, including MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and several other entities, are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. The market enthusiasm is at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction 2026 – 2030 dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. Coinpedia’s BTC Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, Bitcoin faced constant resistance, leading to a decline. By early February, it fell below the 200-day EMA, and now approaching $65K. If it drops below that, it may reach $53K in Q1 2026. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $60,074.20 and $71,584.86 today. Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $65,545.2449 -8.06% Market Cap $ 1,309,927,617,728.46 24h Volume $ 145,126,686,163.65 Circulating Supply 19,985,090.00 Total Supply 19,985,090.00 All-Time High $ 126,198.0696 on 06 October 2025 All-Time Low $ 0.0486 on 14 July 2010 On February 5, 2026, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply below $70,000, marking its lowest point in 15 months. This decline is due to a “risk-off” sentiment in global markets, large-scale liquidations of leveraged positions, and reduced institutional demand. The market reacted to the potential appointment of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair, leading to expectations of tighter monetary policy and a larger U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which increased above 97.5, lessening the attractiveness of riskier assets like Bitcoin. This situation triggered forced liquidations and a decline in demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 11, signaling “Extreme Fear” among investors. Analysts suggest that if Bitcoin cannot hold the $65,000 support level, it may drop further, potentially reaching targets of $60,000 or lower. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 In December 2025, the Bitcoin price retested the lower border of the ascending wedge pattern as resistance, with a slight bullish attempt that proved to be a fakeout, leading to a deeper decline. This is exactly witnessed in January when the fall worsened to $80738 January end,and early February even penetrated the 200-day EMA band and is approaching $65Ksupport area. Itis expected that if BTC/USD doesn’t take support and keeps falling, then odds suggest that beneath $65K, the Q1 2026 could see price falling towards $53K. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2026 $60,000-$95,000 $100,000 – $108,000 $115,000 – $118,000 Bitcoin Price On-chain Outlook The on-chain data has showed strong accumulation in 2025 and sustained declines in exchange reserves. Crucially, this confirms the elevated institutional commitment, which is evident even in the US Spot ETFs data figures and the corporate adoption also reinforces this trend, with public company holdings nearly doubling since the start of the year. Ultimately, a Bitcoin price prediction 2025 suggests that the future potential depends strictly on how sustained buying demand remains, as well as geopolitical stability and regulatory clarity. If the current bullish sentiment persists, the BTC price is expected to reach a cycle high target of $150,000. Conversely, should global uncertainty intensify and sentiment turn negative, the downside risk is projected to find strong support around the $70,000 mark.

Investors should conduct independent research before making any financial decisions.10:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.
