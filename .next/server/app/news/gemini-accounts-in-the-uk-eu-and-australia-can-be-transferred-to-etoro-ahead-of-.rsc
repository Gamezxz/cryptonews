f:T856,Gemini is partnering with eToro to support customers in the
United Kingdom, European Union, and Australia as it prepares to close its
services in these regions.
Last year, eToro’s European subsidiary, eToro Europe Ltd, received
an approval from the Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission. The approval
allows the platform to operate under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets
Regulation and ensures compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive. 
Gemini Shuts UK, EU, Australia Accounts
Effective 6 April 2026, Gemini will shut all customer
accounts in the UK, European Economic Area, and Australia. The closure will
take place in stages. During the initial phase, existing customers can continue
using their accounts, but new account creation and incentive programs will be
disabled.
Starting 5 March 2026, all affected accounts will enter
withdrawal-only mode. Customers will no longer be able to sell crypto assets.
Gemini advises that all remaining crypto and fiat balances be withdrawn before
6 April 2026.
Gemini Guides Clients Ahead eToro Transition
Gemini has issued guidance to customers ahead of the
wind-down. It recommends refraining from new fiat or crypto deposits, unstaking
any staked assets, selling crypto for fiat if needed, and cancelling recurring
orders.
To ease the transition, Gemini has partnered with eToro. The
company stated, “We have partnered with eToro to ensure a smooth transition and
special signup bonuses for Gemini clients in the UK, EU, and Australia
transitioning to the eToro exchange.”
eToro Offers Multi-Asset Platform Access
Gemini clarified that customers are free to move assets to
any platform of their choice and encouraged users to conduct their own
research. The company noted it is not responsible or liable for assets once
they leave the exchange.
eToro operates a multi-asset platform that includes more
than 150 cryptocurrencies, equities from over 20 global stock exchanges, and
over 100 curated Smart Portfolios. Users can also copy trades of more than
4,000 investors on the platform.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
