4:Tef1,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 Ripple’s [XRP] price structure has been trending downwards, printing lower highs while sliding from above $3.50 toward the $1.50 zone. As prices weakened, derivatives activity moved in the opposite direction, creating a visible divergence that framed the current positioning. According to Maartun, a crypto analyst, Open Interest (OI) expanded by roughly +12% in the past 24 hours, at press time. This was not in a single spike but a sustained build across multiple sessions, particularly during relief bounces in November and early January. This rise aligned with increased ETF desk activity and heavier hedging flows, suggesting institutional participation alongside directional bets. Source: X Yet the context matters. Rising OI into a falling price usually signals something other than pure accumulation. Instead, it often reflects speculative leverage entering short exposure or late long positioning attempting dip entries. Liquidation clusters and sell alerts near local tops reinforce that leverage, not spot demand, drives the expansion. As positioning thickens while price compresses, market fragility increases rather than stabilizes. Leverage expansion during price decline often precedes volatility expansion, rather than immediate reversal. Derivatives positioning signals compression XRP’s derivatives market reveals mounting pressure beneath its price action. Funding Rates, which have hovered near neutral, have recently shifted slightly negative. This shift shows shorts paying longs, pointing to growing bearish crowding rather than balanced positioning. As this develops, OI-weighted funding tightens while price falls from the $3.00 region toward $1.50, reinforcing that leverage expansion is driving the move rather than spot selling. The Long/Short R atio adds further context. Seller dominance remains visible across several intervals, with taker sell volume exceeding buy pressure while price trends lower. Source: CoinGlass This alignment reflects clear directional conviction instead of random market activity. Yet liquidation mapping introduces another layer. Heatmap ladders cluster heavily between $1.35 and $1.45 above price, while deeper long liquidations rest near $1.18–$1.22 below. Source: CoinGlass This stacked positioning creates two volatility pathways. Negative funding combined with elevated OI builds short-squeeze potential if the price moves into overhead ladders. On the other hand, failure to rise exposes trapped long positions to cascading liquidations. Market structure, therefore, remains squeeze-prone, not trend-resolved. XRP trades in a clear downtrend, forming lower highs while moving closer to key support. Price recently tested the $1.15 swing low, which aligns with the 100% Fibonacci retracement, where short-term buying appeared. From that level, a small rebound pushed the price toward $1.29, yet momentum remains weak as the broader structure stays bearish. Source: TradingView Above, $1.44 marks former support that has turned into resistance, strengthened by the 78.6% retracement near $1.39. A daily move back above this zone would reduce downside pressure, allowing price to rotate toward the 50% level at $1.73. However, failure to hold $1.15 on a daily close would weaken market confidence, leaving XRP exposed to a deeper move toward the psychological $1.00 level. Final Thoughts XRP declines as Open Interest builds +12%, signaling leverage expansion and rising market fragility rather than spot-driven accumulation. Bearish crowding, negative funding, and dense liquidation ladders leave price squeeze-prone, while $1.15 support remains the breakdown trigger.
