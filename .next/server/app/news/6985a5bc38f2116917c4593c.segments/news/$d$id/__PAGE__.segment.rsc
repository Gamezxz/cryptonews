4:Teac,The cryptocurrency market has faced heavy selling pressure in recent weeks, with Bitcoin briefly dropping to around $60,000 before recovering slightly. Most major altcoins, including Ethereum and Solana, have also fallen. However, despite the overall decline, a few tokens are moving in the opposite direction, drawing investor attention. Two projects in particular: Hyperliquid’s HYPE token and Canton’s CC token, have shown little gains while much of the market remains in the red. Hyperliquid (HYPE) rises on strong platform activity Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE, has surged roughly 50% over the past two weeks, standing out during a period when many cryptocurrencies have dropped. The token’s rise appears to be driven by increased activity on the Hyperliquid trading platform. The exchange recently captured a measurable share of global silver trading volume shortly after listing the asset, boosting trading demand. Since all trading fees on the platform are paid in HYPE, higher trading activity directly increases demand for the token. Institutional attention has also supported sentiment, with major asset managers reportedly exploring exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings linked to the project. In addition, new integrations within other blockchain ecosystems have expanded trading access, improving liquidity and visibility. A recent platform upgrade allowing traders to hedge positions using shared margin has further increased trading efficiency, leading to higher trading volumes, rising open interest, and stronger daily platform revenues — all factors that helped push the token higher even as the broader market declined. Canton (CC) gains as institutional adoption grows Another token outperforming the market is Canton’s CC token, which recently reached a new all-time high and climbed more than 30% in recent weeks. Unlike many retail-focused crypto projects, Canton is designed primarily for institutional finance. Several large financial institutions are already building on or testing the network, including major global banks and financial infrastructure providers. The platform is also being used in tokenization initiatives such as digital government securities, strengthening its institutional relevance. A driver behind the token’s performance is its supply-reduction mechanism. Institutions using the network’s global synchronizer system must burn CC tokens during transactions, steadily reducing circulating supply. With hundreds of thousands of transactions occurring daily, this burn mechanism has created additional upward pressure on price, especially as institutional activity continues to grow.

Feb 6, 2026, 11:14 a.m. IREN (IREN) earnings showed weaker than expected headline results, with the company missing consensus on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as it accelerates its transition from bitcoin mining to AI Cloud. Financially, Q2 revenue declined to $184.7 million, missing expectations and down from $240.3 million in Q1, while the company reported a net loss of $155.4 million, also below consensus. STORY CONTINUES BELOW IREN secured $3.6 billion of GPU financing for its Microsoft contract which together with a $1.9 billion customer prepayment is expected to cover around 95% of GPU related capex. Tech giant Amazon (AMZ) also missed expectations on EPS but beat on revenue , according to investing.com. Investor focus shifted to management’s plan to spend around $200 billion on capex in 2026, primarily AI related. Amazon shares are down 10%. Pre-market update Bitcoin rebounded from around $60,000 to $66,000, driving a broad rally across crypto exposed equities. Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, rose 7% in pre-market trading, mirroring a 7% gain for Galaxy (GLXY) and MARA Holdings (MARA) while Coinbase (COIN) increased by 6%.7:T673,Cardano founder and former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson revealed in a livestream called Red Days that his crypto holdings have lost over 3 billion dollars as Bitcoin fell below 66,000 and ADA dropped to 0.25, down 92 percent from its 2021 peak. Hoskinson stressed his commitment to blockchain technology over profit, saying money is not his motivation, and he would stay dedicated even after such losses. He highlighted his clean record compared to scandals like FTX and urged the community to keep building despite market volatility.

The bold strategy was seen as risky at one point, as the leading cryptocurrency is known for its extreme volatility. While using money from your own account is one thing, taking personal loans takes it to a whole different level. Bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted, as a crash can erase all profits in a jiffy. I n a recent Reddit post, the user highlighted that he purchased BTC using personal loans at an average price of $35,000 over four years. In total, the trader accumulated 4.75 BTC using this innovative method. However, he continued to repay the loans with funds from his day job. Also Read: Bitcoin Fell To $15k In 2022, Then Hit $100k In 2024: A Pattern? Is the Brave Bitcoin Trader in Profit or Regretting His Decision Now? Source: Shutterstock / In Green, modified by Blockworks At the time of the Reddit post, Bitcoin was trading at $76,000 level on Thursday and began attracting attracting bearish sentiments. Moreover, the trader’s wallet had ballooned to $356,000 early February 2026. That’s an unrealized profit of approximately 113% in just four years. This makes the risk worth it as his investment has more than doubled in value. The investor also revealed that he’ll be throwing in more money each month if Bitcoin dips below $70,000. He called it the perfect buying opportunity again, despite still paying off his personal loans to acquire BTC. The risk-to-reward ratio is extremely high in this scenario, but it has paid off handsomely. BTC experienced a major crash on Friday falling to the $65,000 level. The trader also revealed that he plans to take another $50,000 in personal loans if Bitcoin falls further in value. “In the meantime, I’m throwing everything I can at it each month while we’re in the $70-80k range with earned income from my job. I’ve been stacking this whole time while paying down the loans,” he wrote. Note: The post was made on Reddit, and Watcher Guru could not independently verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin holder.0:{"buildId":"5nMZAnrRQ31RVllmD_UPH","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985a5bc38f2116917c4593c","guid":"https://coinpedia.org/?p=541817","__v":0,"author":"﻿Anjali Belgaumkar","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum","altcoins"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"The post Why Smart Money Is Buying These Two Altcoins During the Bitcoin Selloff appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News\nThe cryptocurrency market has faced heavy selling pressure in recent weeks, with Bitcoin briefly dropping to around $60,000 before recovering slightly.
