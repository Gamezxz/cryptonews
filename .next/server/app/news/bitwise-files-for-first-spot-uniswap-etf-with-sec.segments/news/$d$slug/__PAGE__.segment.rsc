4:T7ed,Bitwise Asset Management has filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Uniswap ETF, marking a major step toward a regulated exchange-traded product tied directly to the UNI token. Summary Bitwise has filed for a spot Uniswap ETF, seeking to offer regulated exposure to the UNI token through traditional markets. The proposed ETF would hold UNI directly, with Coinbase Custody named as custodian. UNI traded lower despite the filing, underscoring cautious market sentiment toward altcoins. Uniswap ETF filing fails to lift UNI price Despite the filing, Uniswap ( UNI ) showed little immediate upside. The token continued to trade lower , reflecting cautious sentiment across altcoins even as institutional interest grows. At press time, UNI was exchanging hands at $3.22, down 14.5% over the past 24 hours. The filing, submitted on February 5, 2026, proposes the launch of the “Bitwise Uniswap ETF,” a trust designed to hold Uniswap tokens as its primary asset. It provides investors with a regulated vehicle to gain exposure to UNI price movements through traditional brokerage accounts. According to the SEC registration, the ETF would issue shares intended to trade on a U.S. exchange under a yet-to-be-announced ticker symbol. Bitwise Investment Advisers will sponsor and manage the trust, while Coinbase Custody will hold the Uniswap tokens. The structure aims to offer investors exposure to Uniswap without requiring them to manage wallets or private keys. If approved, the Bitwise Uniswap ETF would be the first regulated ETF focused on a DeFi protocol’s native token in the U.S. market. UNI is the governance token for the Uniswap decentralized exchange, one of the largest decentralized trading venues built on Ethereum. Bitwise’s filing arrives in a market where demand for crypto ETFs is evolving. Bitwise and other issuers have recently filed for a range of altcoin-linked ETFs, including products tied to AAVE, Chainlink, and other major tokens.0:{"buildId":"nyNMduq-QDcIzXqHG9EwS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33877","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448533","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Bitwise Asset Management has filed a Form S-1 registration with the U.S. SEC to launch the first-ever spot Uniswap ETF.
