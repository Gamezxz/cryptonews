4:T1894,Story Highlights The live price of the Avalanche is $ 8.60089098 . Price predictions for 2026 range from $400 to $600. Long term outlook suggests gradual growth potential to approach $1200 by 2030. Aave (AAVE) is a decentralized finance protocol built on Ethereum that facilitates permissionless lending and borrowing through smart contracts. After witnessing a strong expansion in the previous market cycle, AAVE entered a prolonged correction phase, with price gradually retracing from its earlier highs. Throughout 2025, AAVE remained in a consolidation structure, reflecting a period of market digestion rather than trend continuation. While short-term momentum has cooled, the broader technical structure suggests that AAVE may be transitioning into a new accumulation phase. As volatility contracts and price holds above long-term demand levels, attention is now shifting toward whether 2026 can trigger the next major price discovery cycle. Cryptocurrency Avalanche Token AVAX Price $8.6009 -9.66% Market Cap $ 3,713,623,564.44 24h Volume $ 987,651,801.7558 Circulating Supply 431,771,961.1772 Total Supply 463,441,061.1772 All-Time High $ 146.2179 on 21 November 2021 All-Time Low $ 2.7888 on 31 December 2020 CoinPedia’s Avalanche Price Prediction AVAX dropped to $9 after facing resistance at $15 in January. A recovery is possible, with high expectations for Q1 2026. Based on recovery odds, experts are targeting $20 with even potential to reach $28, and if it breaks that, $44 by mid-year. If $28 holds, consolidation may continue. Avalanche (Avax) Price Prediction 2026 In January, the AVAX price faced rejection from $15 and slipped to $9 support zone in early February. Since Q1 still has many days left, a recovery remains an option, as it has reached a demand area of $9 that ignited the late 2024 rally. Sustained demand here could signal a reversal. Now, expectations for its recovery, which are gaining momentum in Q1 2026, are significantly higher. Now, it appears AVAX may not have performed in 2025 to the present time, but it was all about establishing a base, and it seems it has done so. Now, an impressive rally ahead is a strong possibility. For Q1, we expect $20 with potential to test the pattern’s upper border at $28. However, if it clears the upper border, we can expect AVAX to hit $44 by the end of the first half. But if $28 repels, then the first half could see consolidation stretching. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 (conservative) $25 $33 $50 AVAX On-Chain Analysis AVAX shows a highly bullish sentiment. Big Whale Orders in both spot and futures indicate strong institutional accumulation. With Taker Buy Dominance at 90 days, aggressive buyers are in control, while the Cooling volume bubble map suggests a healthy consolidation phase. Collectively, major metrics point to a bullish rally ahead.
