Robert Kiyosaki, a financial guru and the author of the well-known bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad, has posted a new tweet, engaging his followers in a dialogue about Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, rather than seeing a positive reaction, Kiyosaki faced severe criticism from the crypto community. Kiyosaki waits for new Bitcoin bottom to buy more In his tweet, Robert Kiyosaki mentioned four major assets that have been in the news a lot recently – gold, silver, Bitcoin, and the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. Kiyosaki claimed that he has not been buying any of the first three assets recently, stating that he had stopped accumulating gold at $300, silver at $60, and Bitcoin at $6,000. HOT Stories He reminded the community that recently he has had to sell some of his Bitcoin and gold, adding that he hates doing it. The reason is: “I hate paying capital gain taxes.” Although in an earlier tweet, Kiyosaki mentioned that he had done that to buy a new house. Now, Kiyosaki stated, he is waiting for new bottoms where prices would make it acceptable for him to start buying gold and Bitcoin again. He said that he would spread the word on X when he began buying gold and digital gold again. “I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold and Bitcoin, then I may buy again.” AS I POSTED on X earlier. I stopped buying silver at $60. I stopped buying Bitcoin at $6000. I stopped buying gold at $300. I have sold some Bitcoin and some gold. I hate selling because I hate paying capital gain taxes. Today…. I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 6, 2026 As for Ethereum, he revealed that he has enough of it for now but he plans to acquire more. You Might Also Like X crypto community bashes Kiyosaki However, the crypto community did not take this message positively this time. First of all, the Community Notes, a local fact-checking service powered by X users, accused Kiyosaki of lying. The Community Notes stated that Kiyosaki recently tweeted, saying he was buying Bitcoin – he published that tweet on January 23 this year . That was the tweet when he stated that he does not care about the price of Bitcoin or gold going up or down: “I just keep buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum and get richer.” Back then, BTC was trading at roughly $90,000 per coin. You're such a lying grifter holy cow. You've been pumping all 3 of these non stop daily for years and now you claim you were never buying? How you didn't win the financial charlatan of the year award, I'll never understand pic.twitter.com/gv6D9mNLM4 — Mark McGrath (@MarkMcGrathCFP) February 6, 2026 Several commentators also reacted in a similar way, saying that Kiyosaki should stop deceiving people or that there is no way to verify that Kiyosaki’s claims of buying BTC, silver, and gold at low prices, even though they sound quite impressive.0:{"buildId":"vzOw-CdNg9-sgrAuy9IKO","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985b4f638f2116917c7e5e8","guid":"https://u.today/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-slammed-by-community-over-his-bitcoin-tweet","__v":0,"author":"Yuri Molchan","categories":["bitcoin","defi"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Prominent investor Kiyosaki faces criticism from the crypto community on X after his recent Bitcoin tweet.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T09:31:34.629Z","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/100131.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T09:31:34.629Z","link":"https://u.today/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-slammed-by-community-over-his-bitcoin-tweet","pubDate":"2026-02-06T09:16:00.000Z","sentiment":"neutral","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"คิโยซากิ ผู้เขียน \"พ่อรวยพู่จน\" ถูกชุมชนคริปโ","title":"'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Slammed by Community Over His Bitcoin Tweet","translatedContent":"นักลงทุนที่มีชื่อเสียงอย่าง Kiyosaki เผชิญกับการวิจารณ์จากชุมชนคริปโตบน X หลังจากทวีตเกี่ยวกับ Bitcoin ล่าสุดของเขา","translatedTitle":"ผู้แต่ง Rich Dad Poor Dad ถูกชุมชนวิจารณ์อย่างหนักเรื่องทวีตเกี่ยวกับ Bitcoin","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:43:41.261Z","aiSummary":"Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad,' faced criticism from the crypto community over his recent tweet about Bitcoin and other assets.
