ETH price has dropped significantly, slipping below $2K as the latest crypto market dumps took over the sector, wiping away trillions in their wake. This development is now impacting major crypto coins, with the Ethereum price taking a major hit in the middle. The token is down 9% in the last 24 hours, noting a 40% decline in its price in the last month. But is there more to ETH’s price? Will it crash even more than predicted price thresholds?

Buterin reportedly is selling ETH to solidify future plans for Ethereum, including robusting its stack software and hardware. “If you’re wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH.
