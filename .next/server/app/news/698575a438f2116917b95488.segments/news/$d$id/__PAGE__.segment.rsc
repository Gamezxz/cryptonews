4:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

Bitcoin price dropped nearly 8.6%, hovering near the $65,000 level, while Ethereum and major altcoins followed with sharp intraday losses. The intensity of the move points to more than routine profit-taking. With liquidations accelerating and sentiment collapsing into extreme fear, the ongoing crypto crash creates a dilemma among investors, one that forces traders and investors to confront a familiar question: Is this a buy-the-dip moment, or is patience still required? Liquidations Data Reveals Market Still Under Stress The key trigger of today’s crypto crash lies in derivatives data. More than $2.59 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most aggressive leverage flushes of the year. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the bulk of forced closures, while altcoins experienced cascading liquidations as price levels failed in quick succession. At the same time, total open interest fell 10.1% to $95.77 billion, confirming that leverage is being removed, not repositioned. Such conditions typically reflect instability rather than balance. Markets tend to struggle to form durable bottoms while liquidation velocity remains elevated. Sentiment Hits Extreme Fear, But Capitulation Is Incomplete The Crypto market Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, placing sentiment deep into Extreme Fear, a zone that historically precedes medium-term recoveries. However, structural signals remain mixed. Bitcoin exchange balances increased by 13,800 BTC, suggesting that selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself. Coins are still moving toward exchanges rather than being locked away by long-term holders. In previous market cycles, sustainable bottoms emerged after extreme fear persisted alongside declining exchange inflows, a condition that has not yet fully materialized. Bitcoin Price at $65K: A Decision Zone, Not a Confirmed Bottom Bitcoin’s drop toward the $65,000 region is now colliding with a signal that long-term market participants rarely ignore. The monthly stochastic oscillator has slipped into extreme oversold territory, a condition that has appeared only three times over the past decade. Each prior occurrence aligned with major bear market bottoms and the start of prolonged accumulation phases. However, history also shows this signal is not a timing trigger. In previous cycles, Bitcoin did not immediately reverse higher. Instead, price often spent weeks sometimes months moving sideways or making marginal new lows as leverage flushed out and sentiment reset. That dynamic matters today. While the long-term stochastic suggests downside may be structurally limited, short-term data still reflects stress. Open interest is falling, liquidations remain elevated, and exchange balances are rising, indicating that traders are still de-risking rather than rebuilding positions. In practical terms, this creates a split narrative. For long-horizon investors, conditions are beginning to resemble early accumulation zones. For short-term traders, volatility risk remains high until liquidation pressure eases and price stabilizes above key support. The signal argues that Bitcoin may be closer to a bottom than a top, but confirmation will require patience, not prediction. Final Thoughts: Right Time to Buy or Wait? The broader crypto market is showing classic stress signals, not clear bottoming behavior. Extreme fear readings, multi-billion-dollar liquidations, and declining open interest suggest forced deleveraging is still working its way through the system. While some assets are showing relative strength and selective accumulation, this looks more like rotation and positioning not a broad-based recovery. Historically, durable market bottoms form after volatility compresses and sellers exhaust, not during peak liquidation phases. Right now, liquidity is thin and confidence remains fragile, leaving room for further downside or prolonged consolidation. This is not a clear “buy the dip” moment for the overall market. Caution and patience are still the better strategy, with selective accumulation only where strong fundamentals and on-chain support clearly justify it.

The cryptocurrency saw a single-day decline of over $10,000, wiping out significant market value and triggering widespread liquidations. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $434.1 million in net outflows on February 5, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, reflecting growing caution among institutional investors.

ETH price has dropped significantly, slipping below $2K as the latest crypto market dumps took over the sector, wiping away trillions in their wake. This development is now impacting major crypto coins, with the Ethereum price taking a major hit in the middle. The token is down 9% in the last 24 hours, noting a 40% decline in its price in the last month. But is there more to ETH’s price? Will it crash even more than predicted price thresholds? Let’s find out. Also Read: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Dumps $6.6 Million Worth of ETH Ethereum Price Narratives: What Is Up With The Asset? Source: Decrypt Ethereum has fallen 40% in the last month, down significantly from its earlier ATH of $4K. The token is expected to have sharp volatility as of late, with its momentum hitting new roadblocks each day. The token is now sitting at $1.9K, showing a wobbly road ahead, as markets try their best to regain their lost footing. Despite the buildable pressure on the asset, experts are stating that Ethereum may ultimately come out stronger than ever, with the tokenization elements involved keeping the asset afloat and steady in the long run. The latest ETH fall is a result of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, selling 16,384 ETH, causing a temporary market mayhem. Buterin reportedly is selling ETH to solidify future plans for Ethereum, including robusting its stack software and hardware. “If you’re wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH. He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware. This includes areas like privacy-preserving technologies (e.g., ZK proofs, FHE, differential privacy), secure hardware, encrypted messaging apps, local-first software, operating systems, biotech (personal and public health), finance, communication, and governance tools.” If you're wondering why Vitalik Buterin recently withdrew and sold some ETH: He withdrew 16,384 $ETH to personally fund open-source initiatives focused on creating a secure, verifiable, and open full stack of software and hardware.
