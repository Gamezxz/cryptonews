f:Ta58,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 Once dominated by a handful of heavyweights, there’s now buzz around more newer entrants in stablecoins. The market is set to be a lot more more competitive and dynamic than it has been in years! Here’s what you need to know. Fidelity is in the stablecoin race Fidelity Investments has officially launched its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin – the FIDD. The token is now available to both retail and institutional users. Source: X FIDD is issued by Fidelity Digital Assets, National Association, on Ethereum [ETH] . Users can buy or redeem the stablecoin directly with Fidelity at a 1:1 ratio with the U.S. dollar across Fidelity Digital Assets, Fidelity Crypto, and Fidelity Crypto for Wealth Managers. The company said FIDD will also trade on external crypto exchanges where it is listed. Holders can transfer the token to any Ethereum mainnet address. The reserve assets backing FIDD are managed by Fidelity Management & Research. CME Group to launch its own stablecoin? CME Group is mulling over the idea of launching its own token, according to comments made by CEO Terry Duffy during the firm’s latest earnings call. Responding to a question on tokenized collateral, Duffy said the derivatives giant is exploring “initiatives with our own coin” that could run on a decentralized network. Duffy tied the idea to rising interest in tokenized cash and more efficient margining. He added that tokens issued by important institutions could carry greater trust in financial markets. CME is already working with Google on a tokenized cash solution. The project is expected to launch later this year and will involve a depository bank to support transactions. The potential “CME Coin” appears to be a separate initiative. It remains unclear whether it would take the form of a stablecoin. However, much of the community seems to think it will be. Base overtakes Ethereum In January, Base overtook Ethereum to become the largest chain by monthly stablecoin transfer volume. Recent data per Token Terminal showed Base’s volumes going faster into 2026, while Ethereum’s growth has been relatively steadier and less aggressive. Source: Token Terminal Users and developers look like they’re prioritizing lower fees and faster execution over legacy dominance. Other networks like Solana [SOL] and Tron [TRX] are competing for share too. The big story is that the stablecoin market is no longer confined to a few mega players. Final Thoughts Fidelity’s FIDD launch and CME’s token plans mean stablecoins are on their way to becoming mainstream. Low cost and speed now matter more than brand value.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853ad038f2116917acb8ab","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=567821","__v":0,"author":"Samyukhtha L KM","categories":["general"],"category":"general","content":"The category is becoming faster, cheaper and more institutional.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:24.170Z","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Samyukhtha-16.webp","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:24.171Z","link":"https://ambcrypto.com/stablecoins-hit-a-turning-point-as-fidelity-launches-fidd-details/","pubDate":"2026-02-05T19:00:58.000Z","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"Fidelity เปิดตัว FIDD ทำให้สเตเบิลคอยน์เข้าสู่จุดเปลี่ยนที่สำคัญ ซึ่งหมวดสินทรัพย์นี้กำลังกลายเป็นที่เร็ว ราคาถูกลง และเข้าถึงสถาบันมากขึ้น","title":"Stablecoins hit a turning point as Fidelity launches FIDD – Details","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T17:52:03.858Z","sentiment":"bullish","translatedContent":"หมวดหมู่นี้กำลังกลายเป็นที่เร็วขึ้น ถูกลง และมีสถาบันเข้ามาเกี่ยวข้องมากขึ้น","translatedTitle":"Stablecoins ถึงจุดเปลี่ยนขณะที่ Fidelity เปิดตัว FIDD – รายละเอียด","slug":"stablecoins-hit-a-turning-point-as-fidelity-launches-fidd-details","fullContent":"$f","scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":423},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69868fca38f2116917d5f468","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T01:01:11.000Z","slug":"edward-woodford-the-crypto-industry-is-overly-focused-on-interest-rates-accounta","source":"Crypto Briefing","title":"Edward Woodford: The crypto industry is overly focused on interest rates, accountability in AI is crucial for trust, and regulatory clarity is essential for market stability | Unchained","translatedTitle":"เอ็ดเวิร์ด วูดฟอร์ด: อุตสาหกรรมคริปโต้เนอะเกินไปกับอัตราดอกเบี้ย ความรับผิดชอบของ AI เป็นสิ่งสำคัญสำหรับความไว้วางใจ และความชัดเจนทางกฎหมายสำครับความมั่นคงของตลาด | Unchained"},{"_id":"6986879638f2116917d59ab8","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:25:00.000Z","slug":"krakens-big-hint-pi-coin-set-for-exchange-listing-in-2026","source":"DailyCoin","title":"Kraken’s Big Hint: Pi Coin Set for Exchange Listing In 2026","translatedTitle":"Kraken บอกเบาะแส: Pi Coin กำลังจะมีการลงตลาดบน Kraken ในปี 2026"},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c34","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:00:02.000Z","slug":"chainlink-are-investors-buying-the-fear-amid-links-12-drop","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"Chainlink: Are investors buying the fear amid LINK’s 12% drop?","translatedTitle":"Chainlink: นักลงทุนกำลังซื้อในช่วงที่กังวลไปกับการลดลง 12% ของ LINK?"},{"_id":"6986772e38f2116917d4bcb0","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-06T23:17:38.000Z","slug":"why-crypto-is-down-and-when-it-might-bottom-insights-from-bitwises-matt-hougan","source":"Crypto.news","title":"Why crypto is down and when it might bottom: Insights from Bitwise’s Matt Hougan","translatedTitle":"ทำไม Crypto ถึงถอยและจะจอดตัวต่ำเมื่อไหร่: ข้อมูลเชิงลึกจาก Matt Hougan ของ Bitwise"}]}],"$L10"]
