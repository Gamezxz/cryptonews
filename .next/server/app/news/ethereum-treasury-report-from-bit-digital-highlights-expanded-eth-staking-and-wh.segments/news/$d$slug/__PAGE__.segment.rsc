4:T144e,In its latest update, Bit digital outlined January 2026 metrics for its Ethereum treasury, staking activity, and strategic equity holdings. Summary Ethereum holdings and valuation in January 2026 Staking strategy and yield metrics Equity structure and shares outstanding WhiteFiber investment update and strategic focus Corporate profile and investor communication Ethereum holdings and valuation in January 2026 As of January 31, 2026 , Bit Digital Inc. reported total holdings of approximately 155,239.4 ETH , underscoring its role as an active participant in the Ethereum ecosystem. Moreover, the company noted that this balance includes both directly held assets and ETH-equivalents managed externally. Based on a closing ETH price of approximately $2,449 on January 31, 2026 , the market value of the company’s Ethereum position reached roughly $380.2 million . However, the firm’s total average ETH acquisition price for all holdings stood at approximately $3,045 as of the same date, illustrating the gap between book cost and current market pricing. The company clarified that its total figure includes approximately 15,236.4 ETH and ETH-equivalents held in an externally managed fund. That said, the bulk of assets remain closely tied to Bit Digital Inc.’s core infrastructure and staking operations. Staking strategy and yield metrics Staking remains central to the firm’s approach. As of January 31, 2026, the company’s total staked Ethereum amounted to approximately 138,266 ETH , or about 89% of its overall holdings. Moreover, this high staking ratio reflects a deliberate focus on protocol-native yield and long-duration exposure to Ethereum infrastructure. During the January 2026 period, staking operations generated approximately 344.0 ETH in rewards . According to the report, this level of rewards represented an annualized yield of approximately 2.9% . However, management continues to emphasize disciplined balance sheet management while seeking to optimize staking returns within prevailing network conditions. The company highlighted that these ETH staking metrics form a key part of its strategy to support the Ethereum network directly and to capture yield without relying on leverage-based strategies. Equity structure and shares outstanding Alongside on-chain data, Bit Digital Inc. also provided an update on its equity base. As of January 31, 2026, Bit Digital shares outstanding totaled 324,202,059 . Moreover, the company maintains its positioning as a Strategic Asset Company, aligning capital allocation with long-duration themes such as Ethereum and AI /HPC infrastructure. Investors tracking Bit digital stock may view the share count, combined with Ethereum and strategic equity holdings, as a key factor when assessing overall exposure to digital assets and infrastructure-related revenues. WhiteFiber investment update and strategic focus Beyond its ethereum treasury report, the company reiterated the importance of its majority ownership stake in WhiteFiber (WYFI) . Bit Digital Inc. maintains ownership of approximately 27.0 million WhiteFiber shares , with a market value of about $527.6 million as of January 31, 2026. Moreover, this position provides significant indirect exposure to AI and high-performance computing infrastructure. On January 28, 2026 , Bit Digital Inc. reaffirmed its long-term investment in WhiteFiber. The company confirmed that it will not sell any of its WhiteFiber shares in any secondary offering or other discretionary disposition during 2026. However, this stance also signals a commitment to stability and continued alignment with WhiteFiber’s growth strategy. The company described itself as a Strategic Asset Company that allocates capital toward long-duration, foundational infrastructure, supported by disciplined balance sheet management. That said, management continues to emphasize participation in Ethereum infrastructure and controlled equity exposure to AI/HPC via its majority stake in WhiteFiber. Corporate profile and investor communication Bit Digital Inc. purchases and stakes ETH directly to generate protocol-native yield and to participate in network operations. Moreover, the firm’s dual focus on Ethereum and AI/HPC infrastructure aims to position it at the intersection of blockchain , computing, and digital asset markets. In summary, Bit Digital Inc.’s January 2026 disclosure underscores substantial Ethereum holdings, a high proportion of staked assets, and a firmly held strategic position in WhiteFiber, all underpinned by a long-term infrastructure-oriented mandate.
