4:T3079,Bitcoin is plummeting toward a dangerous $56,100 price floor as massive ETF outflows signal a demand crisis At some point every cycle has the same moment, the one where the story stops being about charts and starts being about cash. You can see it in the way traders talk, the jokes dry up, the group chats turn into screenshots of liquidation ladders, and everyone suddenly cares about the same thing, collateral, how much is left, how fast it can move, and what has to be sold to keep everything else alive. This week that moment arrived across two markets that almost never share the same headline, Bitcoin and silver. Since last week, Bitcoin has dropped by about 24%, from about $90,076 to as low as $66,700. Silver has fallen even harder, down around 34% over the same window. Gold is down over 6%. US equity futures are lower, down about 2%. The dollar has pushed higher, up about 2% on DXY. Oil has ticked up about 1.6%. That mix matters, because it reads like stress, not rotation. When the dollar is rising, and the biggest risk assets are falling, the instinctive trade is to get smaller, raise cash, reduce leverage, and survive the next headline. And headlines have been doing plenty of work. Silver’s crash had a trigger, leverage got more expensive Silver moved like a trapdoor. The immediate catalyst was mechanical. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margin requirements for precious metals, asking traders to put up more cash to hold positions, after a period of extreme volatility. Silver futures fell sharply after the move, with gold sliding too, as the new rules squeezed leveraged players who had ridden the rally. The details show why it hit so hard. CME Clearing lifted COMEX silver’s margin in late December, first raising the initial requirement from $20,000 to $25,000, then hiking it again to $32,500 just days later. From there, the squeeze intensified: by late January, CME shifted to steeper percentage-based settings, and in early February, it raised the rate again (from 11% to 15%), forcing traders to post substantially more collateral per contract. The cash required now scales higher as prices rise, a compounding squeeze that forces leveraged longs to cut risk quickly when the market turns. For anyone running high leverage, that’s effectively an abrupt reduction in position size, fuel for a fast, disorderly unwind when prices wobble. Margin hikes force a decision. Add cash, cut size, or close the position. When enough people get the same message at the same time, selling becomes the only language the market understands. Silver did not fall because the world suddenly stopped needing silver. It fell because the price had become a leveraged bet, and the cost of that bet just went up. That is what makes this week feel bigger than a normal crypto drawdown. The stress is showing up in places that are supposed to be boring. Bitcoin is falling through floors, one level at a time Bitcoin’s drop has been violent, yet it has been structured. The chart since Jan 28 looks like a staircase lower, with brief pauses, then another break, then another fast flush. From the baseline, Bitcoin spent the first day slipping under the high $80,000s, then it lost the low $80,000s, then it broke into the $70,000s, and now it is fighting to hold the high $60,000s. The key levels in my two-year channel map have been doing their job, and that is the problem for bulls. On the 30-minute timeframe below: The first meaningful break came when Bitcoin lost the $83,500 region. The next breakdown was the $77,000 area, where the market tried to balance, then failed. The moment that changed the tone was $73,600, the 2024 high, the level that has been a memory anchor for months. Bitcoin sell off (Source: TradingView) That $73,600 line is the one my longer-term chart below has been screaming about. Bitcoin is supposed to treat former highs as support in a strong trend. When it loses them, the market starts looking for the next shelf, and the next one down sits around $56,100, a level that was tested multiple times in 2024. Below that, we start looking to the $40,000s. Long-term Bitcoin price since 2024 (Source: TradingView) With price hovering around $70,000, the path to $56,100 is a risk map rather than a prdiction. It is roughly a 20% drop away, and it becomes more likely when the market is forced to sell instead of choosing to sell. ETF flows helped build the rally, and they are now part of the sell pressure The cleanest way to understand this Bitcoin move is to stop arguing about narratives and start watching the plumbing. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have been the most important marginal signal since these products went live. When flows are consistently positive, dips get bought faster. When flows flip and stay negative, the market loses its cushion. Data from Farside shows the late January and early February tape has been defined by heavy outflows and failed rebounds. In the days around the current breakdown : * Jan 29, net spot Bitcoin ETF flow was about -$817.8 million. Jan 30, net flow was about -$509.7 million. Feb 2, the market finally saw relief, about +$561.8 million in net inflows. Feb 3, the bid faded again, about -$272.0 million. Feb 4, the selling returned hard, about -$544.9 million. That is a market that cannot keep good news. One strong inflow day lands, the bounce shows up, then it gets swallowed by the next wave of supply. This does not mean ETFs are the only driver of price, yet they are the best daily read on whether there is real demand stepping in through the biggest, most regulated on ramp in the world. The current pattern says demand is hesitant and supply is comfortable. The October to February story is one long mood swing If you want the longer arc, go back to October 2025, because it reads like the beginning of a finale. In early October, the ETF bid was still showing real power. Farside data shows net inflows of roughly: +$675.8 million on Oct 1 +$627.2 million on Oct 2 +$985.1 million on Oct 3 +$1.205 billion on Oct 6 That is the kind of flow that makes people feel smart for buying any dip, because the dips keep disappearing. Then, later in October, the mood changed. On Oct 16, net flow flipped to about -$530 million. Farside shows more outflows followed, with other ugly days on Oct 29 and Oct 30 at around $-470 million and -$488.4 million, respectively. November delivered the kind of outflow number that feels like a warning siren. Nov 20 alone showed around -$903.2 million in net outflows. January was whiplash. Inflows returned, with Jan 5 showing around +$697 million. Then the selling came back, Jan 6 at about -$243 million, Jan 7 at about -$486 million, Jan 29 at about -$817 million. The point is not to obsess over one day, the point is the character of the tape. When flows are large and choppy, the market becomes fragile, because positioning becomes fragile. Since Jan 15, there have been only two days on which flows have been net positive. Fragile positioning breaks on macro pressure. Macro pressure is rising again, and inflation is the reason the market feels trapped Bitcoin bulls can handle bad headlines when liquidity is expanding. They struggle when the central bank is sending a different message, even quietly. On Jan 28, 2026, the Federal Reserve’s implementation note set the federal funds target range at 3.5% to 3.75%. A 3 handle suggests cuts have already happened compared to the peak, yet the important part is the tone that sits behind it, inflation still matters, volatility still matters, and policy does not pivot just because markets want it to. The inflation warning is getting louder, and it is coming from serious places. An analysis from PIIE argues the risk of higher inflation in 2026 is being underpriced, pointing to tariffs, fiscal dynamics, labor market tightness, and shifting expectations as potential drivers. Tariffs matter here, because they are the kind of policy that can hit growth and prices at the same time, and markets hate that combination. CryptoSlate Daily Brief Daily signals, zero noise.

The Fed itself has laid out the pathway in research. A note from FEDS shows higher trade costs, including tariffs and disruptions, can push CPI inflation higher, with measurable effects. The political layer is messy, and the economic layer is slow. The market trades both, and it rarely does it gracefully. Even the IMF’s tone has shifted toward caution around trade disruptions. In January, IMF wrote that the global economy has shown resilience after a tariff shock, while warning about rising risks and the negative effects of trade disruptions building over time. Meanwhile, the trade policy world itself is being described as a roller coaster. CFR notes the return of tariff threats and the uncertainty that comes with a White House driven trade strategy. Put all of that together and you get the feeling traders keep describing in private, the recovery trade looks like it wants to show up, then inflation risk pulls it back into the cage. Bitcoin’s best moments happen when the market believes liquidity is coming, and when inflation is calm enough to allow it. Right now, that calm is missing. The cross asset signals look like a dollar squeeze, and Bitcoin is acting like high beta tech again Bitcoin shows a clear relationship with the broader risk complex. It has moved more closely with US equity futures than with gold, and it has tended to move the other way when the dollar firms. That is a fancy way of saying Bitcoin is still trading like a risk asset when stress rises, and this week stress has been rising. That is also why the silver crash matters for crypto readers. When silver is dropping double digits, and Bitcoin is dropping double digits, the common thread is leverage and forced selling. The first wave hits the most crowded trade, the next wave hits whatever can be sold fast. Crypto is always sellable. Oil is rising for the wrong reasons, and that adds to the unease Oil has been up modestly in this same window, and the reasons are not comforting. There has been the fresh geopolitical risk around Venezuelan supply. Price moves tied to the blockade announcement and broader supply risk headlines after the Maduro capture continue to strain markets. At the same time, the medium term oil narrative has been about oversupply, with Trafigura warning about a 2026 “super glut” as supply growth runs ahead of demand. Oil up on geopolitical risk while the market is already worried about inflation is a toxic ingredient. It adds noise to the inflation picture, it adds pressure to the Fed, and it adds anxiety to traders who are already staring at margin calls. What to watch next, if you are trying to survive the next week The temptation is to pick a bottom and build a story around it. The market has not earned that luxury yet. Here is the cleaner way to view it. Bitcoin has one job if it wants to stop bleeding, reclaim $73,600 , and hold it. That is the 2024 high, and it is now the line between a bruising correction and a deeper reset toward the next major shelf around $56,100. Read my piece from November, where I literally called out this exact scenario below: ETF flows have one job too, stabilize. The table from Farside has been swinging from heavy outflows to brief inflows and back again, and that is what a fragile market looks like. Macro has its own job, calm down. That means inflation expectations need to stop creeping higher, tariff headlines need to stop adding uncertainty, and the Fed needs room to breathe, because right now the market is trading like it is constantly bracing for the next upside inflation surprise. Silver is the wild card, because silver has already shown you what happens when leverage meets a margin hike. That is why this week feels like the moment margin calls went global. Crypto traders have lived through forced selling for years, it usually starts inside the ecosystem, it usually ends inside the ecosystem. This time the stress is showing up in the old world too, in metals, in rates anxiety, in trade disruption headlines, and in the dollar. The story is still Bitcoin, yet the setting is broader, and it looks a lot less forgiving.

This decline mirrors a severe crash in silver, which fell 34% after the CME raised margin requirements, triggering a global margin call and forcing widespread deleveraging across risk assets. The simultaneous drop in Bitcoin and silver alongside a rising US dollar suggests market stress is driving investors to raise cash rather than rotate assets.\n\nTechnically, Bitcoin is breaking down key support levels, including the 2024 high of $73,600, in a structured 'staircase' pattern. The selling pressure is exacerbated by massive outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen hundreds of millions in net withdrawals over recent days. The lack of consistent institutional demand indicates that the market is currently unable to absorb the selling pressure, increasing the risk of further declines.","aiSummaryThai":"Bitcoin กำลังดิ่งลงเข้าสู่ระดับแนวรับที่สำคัญที่ $56,100 หลังจากราคาตกลงมาประมาณ 24% การร่วงลงนี้สอดคล้องกับแนวโน้มของเงินทองคำ (Silver) ที่พุ่งลงถึง 34% หลังจากที่ CME เพิ่มข้อกำหนด Margin ทำให้เกิดแรงขายบังคับปิดสถานะ (Margin Call) อย่างกว้างขวาง สถานการณ์ที่ทรัพย์สินเสี่ยงต่างร่วงลงพร้อมกับดอลลาร์ที่แข็งค่าสะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความกดดันในตลาดที่บังคับให้นักลงทุนต้องระดมทุนสด\n\nในมุมเทคนิค Bitcoin ได้ทะลุระดับการสนับสนุนสำคัญหลายจุด รวมถึงระดับสูงสุดปี 2024 ที่ $73,600 ในรูปแบบขั้นบันไดลงมาอย่างต่อเนื่อง แรงขายที่รุนแรงได้รับการเสริมด้วยเงินทุนไหลออกจำนวนมากจาก Spot Bitcoin ETF ซึ่งบ่งชี้ว่าความต้องการจากสถาบันยังอ่อนแอและตลาดขาดแรงหนุนที่เพียงพอในการรองรับ","fullContent":"$4","keyPoints":["Bitcoin is dropping toward the $56,100 support level after a 24% decline.","Silver crashed 34% due to increased CME margin requirements, triggering a broader deleveraging event.","Spot Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing significant net outflows, signaling weak demand.","A rising US dollar and falling risk assets indicate market stress rather than asset rotation."],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":2129},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986d52438f2116917d8e575","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T06:00:03.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-whale-inflows-to-binance-hit-highest-level-since-2022-distribution-or-re","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Bitcoin Whale Inflows To Binance Hit Highest Level Since 2022: Distribution Or Repositioning?","translatedTitle":""},{"_id":"6986d04138f2116917d89c09","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:54.000Z","slug":"google-search-volume-for-bitcoin-skyrockets-amid-btc-price-swings","source":"Cointelegraph","title":"Google search volume for 'Bitcoin' skyrockets amid BTC price swings","translatedTitle":"ปริมาณการค้นหา 'Bitcoin' บน Google พุ่งสูงสุดขึ้นเมื่อราคา BTC ผันผัน"},{"_id":"6986d16c38f2116917d8b420","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:00.000Z","slug":"xrp-still-in-bull-market-versus-bitcoin-and-xrpbtc-chart-puts-51-upside-on-the-m","source":"U.Today","title":"XRP Still in Bull Market Versus Bitcoin, and XRP/BTC Chart Puts 51% Upside on the Menu","translatedTitle":"XRP ยังอยู่ในตลาดเพชรฟองต่อบิทคอยน์ และแผนภูมิ XRP/BTC มีศักยภาพเพิ่มขึ้น 51%"},{"_id":"6986cde738f2116917d86b4a","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:27:34.000Z","slug":"nft-sales-plunge-20-to-583-million-as-bitcoin-price-struggles-at-70000","source":"Crypto.news","title":"NFT sales plunge 20% to $58.3 million as Bitcoin price struggles at $70,000","translatedTitle":"ยอดขาย NFT ลดลง 20% เหลือ 58.3 ล้านดอลลาร์ เมื่อราคา Bitcoin ต่ำกว่า 70,000 ดอลลาร์"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
