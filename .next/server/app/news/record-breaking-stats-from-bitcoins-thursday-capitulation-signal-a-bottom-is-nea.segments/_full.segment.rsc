f:T7e9,Extreme capitulation metrics are now matching levels seen only at major cycle lows. Feb 6, 2026, 3:30 p.m. Bitcoin's BTC $65,998.81 Feb. 5 collapse will go down as one of the most historic selloffs on record. Below are the key statistics that help define the event and indicate how much further there may be to fall. The bitcoin price started the day near $73,000 and fell to a low around $62,000, a drop — or, as some market participants call it, a candle — of more than $10,000. The day's 14% decline was the largest single-day drop since November 2022, during the implosion of crypto exchange FTX. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The Fear and Greed Index dropped into single digits, a level seen only a handful of times in bitcoin’s 17-year history. At the same time, bitcoin was the third most oversold it has ever been on the RSI , an indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements. Supply in profit and loss The circulating supply in loss, meaning the number of coins that last moved at prices higher than the market price, surged to almost 10 million BTC. That is the fourth-highest level ever, comparable with the 2015, 2019 and 2022 bear-market bottoms. Total Supply in Loss (Glassnode) Another measure, the amount of long-term holders' circulating supply that is at a loss, reached 4.6 million BTC. At the lows of previous bear markets, the figure exceeded 5 million BTC, suggesting this metric is approaching, but has not yet fully matched, prior extremes. Total Supply in Loss by LTHs (Glassnode) Supply in profit and supply in loss have nearly converged, a condition that has historically aligned with the bottom of major market declines. At present, roughly 10 million BTC sit in profit and 10 million BTC sit in loss. While nobody knows for certain whether the bottom is in for bitcoin, history suggests it is likely close, especially with bitcoin already recovering toward $68,000. Still, market participants may be waiting for bitcoin to test its 200-week moving average, currently near $58,011.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"69860a49bd1d672632b59f31","guid":"c5124d54-b087-4bc2-a998-803b3e5cfcaa","slug":"record-breaking-stats-from-bitcoins-thursday-capitulation-signal-a-bottom-is-nea","title":"Record breaking stats from bitcoin’s Thursday capitulation signal a bottom is near","link":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/record-breaking-stats-from-bitcoin-s-thursday-capitulation-signal-a-bottom-is-near","pubDate":"2026-02-06T15:30:37.000Z","content":"Extreme capitulation metrics are now matching levels seen only at major cycle lows.","author":"James Van Straten","enclosure":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c397ec470875d547d7ecf10a967c19f1a197d7fc-1919x1080.jpg?fm=jpg&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","source":"CoinDesk","sourceCategory":"general","category":"bitcoin","categories":["bitcoin"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"สถิติที่สร้างสถิติใหม่จากการขายทิ้ง Bitcoin ในวันพฤหัสบดีบ่งชี้ว่าราคาต่ำสุดใกล้เข้ามาแล้ว","translatedContent":"ตัวชี้วัดการขายทิ้งขนาดใหญ่ตอนนี้อยู่ในระดับที่ตรงกับที่เคยพบเจอเฉพาะในจุดต่ำสุดของวงจรราคาหลักเท่านั้น","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$f","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":343,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T15:35:37.493Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T15:35:37.495Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T19:20:36.139Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69863f04f07b856ce09f6c9c","slug":"coinbases-crypto-backed-loans-notch-record-liquidations-amid-bitcoin-ethereum-pl","title":"Coinbase's Crypto-Backed Loans Notch Record Liquidations Amid Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge","pubDate":"2026-02-06T19:19:12.000Z","source":"Decrypt","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"สินเชื่อที่รับประกันด้วย Crypto ของ Coinbase มียอด Liquidations สูงเป็นสถิติใหม่ขณะที่ราคา Bitcoin และ Ethereum ร่วงหลัก"},{"_id":"69863b7cbd1d672632b6160d","slug":"bitcoin-dips-to-60k-trm-labs-becomes-crypto-unicorn-finance-redefined","title":"Bitcoin dips to $60K, TRM Labs becomes crypto unicorn: Finance Redefined","pubDate":"2026-02-06T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin ร่วงลงสู่ระดับ 60,000 เหรียญ, TRM Labs กลายเป็น crypto unicorn: Finance Redefined"},{"_id":"69863a55bd1d672632b6159a","slug":"bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-eyes-big-rally-to-94k-after-forming-potential-botto","title":"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Eyes Big Rally To $94K After Forming Potential Bottom","pubDate":"2026-02-06T18:58:56.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคา Bitcoin: BTC มองการฟื้นตัวครั้งใหญ่ไปสู่ระดับ $94K หลังจากก่อตัวแนวรับที่เป็นไปได้"},{"_id":"698637f4bd1d672632b60d94","slug":"price-predictions-26-btc-eth-bnb-xrp-sol-doge-ada-bch-hype-xmr","title":"Price predictions 2/6: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, DOGE, ADA, BCH, HYPE, XMR","pubDate":"2026-02-06T18:47:21.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคา 2/6: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, DOGE, ADA, BCH, HYPE, XMR"}]}],"$L10"]
