10:T73e,AI-powered agents promise a revolution in personalized task execution by autonomously expanding their capabilities. Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, today announced the launch of ai.com, a new AI platform that allows consumers to create autonomous agents capable of executing tasks on their behalf. The platform enables users to generate private AI agents that can organize work, send messages, execute actions across apps, and build projects. A key feature is the agents’ ability to autonomously develop missing capabilities to complete tasks, with improvements shared across millions of agents on the network. “We are at a fundamental shift in AI’s evolution as we rapidly move beyond basic chats to AI agents actually getting things done for humans,” Marszalek said. “Our vision is a decentralized network of billions of agents who self-improve and share these improvements with each other, vastly and rapidly expanding agentic capabilities and accelerating the advent of AGI.” Users will soon be able to deploy agents to trade stocks, automate workflows, manage calendars, and perform other actions while maintaining privacy and control. All agents operate in secure environments with encrypted, user-specific data segregation. The platform will debut on February 8, alongside a commercial launch during Super Bowl LX on NBC. Users can start for free, with paid subscription tiers offering enhanced capabilities and increased input tokens. Marszalek acquired the ai.com domain in 2025 in what is believed to be the largest domain purchase in history. He will serve as CEO of both ai.com and Crypto.com, which has grown to over 150 million retail users. The platform is exploring future offerings including financial services integrations, agent marketplaces, and collaborative social networks. This is a developing story.5:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"_id":"698600e6bd1d672632b58996","guid":"https://cryptobriefing.com/?p=189440","slug":"cryptocom-ceo-unveils-new-ai-platform-that-builds-intelligent-agents-for-consume","title":"Crypto.com CEO unveils new AI platform that builds intelligent agents for consumers","link":"https://cryptobriefing.com/ai-agents-platform-launch/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T14:54:17.000Z","content":"The launch of AI agents could revolutionize consumer task automation, potentially accelerating the development of advanced general intelligence.\nThe post Crypto.com CEO unveils new AI platform that builds intelligent agents for consumers appeared first on Crypto Briefing.","author":"Vivian Nguyen","enclosure":"https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06095251/f6bf3f48-0aa9-45a3-a8f0-d12d3541dae0-400x210.jpg","source":"Crypto Briefing","sourceCategory":"general","category":"general","categories":["general"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"Crypto.com CEO เปิดตัวแพลตฟอร์ม AI ใหม่ที่สร้างเอเจนต์อัจฉริยะสำหรับผู้บริโภค","translatedContent":"การเปิดตัว AI agents อาจเป็นการปฏิวัติการทำงานอัตโนมัติของผู้บริโภค และอาจเร่งให้เกิดการพัฒนาความฉลาดเทียมเชิงทั่วไปขั้นสูงขึ้น","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$10","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":277,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T14:55:34.988Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T14:55:34.989Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T05:35:16.249Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986cb9038f2116917d85623","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:17:35.000Z","slug":"hyperliquid-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-will-hype-price-hit-a-new-ath","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Hyperliquid Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Will HYPE Price Hit A New ATH?","translatedTitle":"คาดการณ์ราคา Hyperliquid 2026, 2027 – 2030: ราคา HYPE จะทะลุขีดจำกัดใหม่ได้ไหม?"},{"_id":"6986c80a38f2116917d8356e","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:47.000Z","slug":"pi-coin-price-prediction-what-next-after-altcoin-rejects-0190-retest","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"Pi coin price prediction – What next after altcoin rejects $0.190 retest?","translatedTitle":"คาดการณ์ราคะเหรียญ Pi - จะเกิดอะไรขึ้นหลังจากเหรียญอัลติคอยน์ปฏิเสธการทดสอบราคาที่ $0.190 อีกครั้ง?"},{"_id":"6986cde738f2116917d86b48","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:01.000Z","slug":"crypto-firms-raise-258m-despite-2-trillion-market-drawdown","source":"DL News","title":"Crypto firms raise $258m despite $2 trillion market drawdown ","translatedTitle":"บริษัทคริปโตระดมทุน 258 ล้านดอลลาร์ แม้ตลาดสูญเสีย 2 ล้านล้านดอลลาร์"},{"_id":"6986b9fb38f2116917d7aaf3","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T04:00:36.000Z","slug":"fartcoin-how-648m-whale-sell-off-hurt-the-memecoins-price","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"FARTCOIN: How $64.8M whale sell-off hurt the memecoin’s price","translatedTitle":"FARTCOIN: การขายครึ่งแสนล้านของ Whale ทำให้ราคา memecoin ตกลง"}]}],"$L11"]
