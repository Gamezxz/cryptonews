4:Td33,ARK Invest, the investment firm led by well-known tech investor Cathie Wood, has made a notable portfolio move after a sharp fall in crypto-linked stocks. The firm sold about $17 million worth of Coinbase shares and used nearly the same amount to buy stock in digital asset platform Bullish, signaling a strategy change during market weakness. Coinbase (COIN) shares have fallen heavily in recent weeks, dropping more than 40% over the past month and hitting multi-month lows. As prices continued to weaken, ARK Invest sold 119,236 shares of Coinbase, worth around $17.4 million in a single trade session. ARK had mostly been buying Coinbase on dips and had not sold shares for many months. In fact, just days before this sale, the firm had added a small number of Coinbase shares, continuing its earlier buy-the-dip pattern. 🌐 💹 Crypto Update: Cathie Wood’s ARK dumps $17M in Coinbase stock as shares fall 37% YTD Girl, Cathie Wood finally getting real about Coinbase's struggles? Smart move, 'cause that YTD drop is no joke and sometimes you just gotta protect your portfolio. pic.twitter.com/S5nxLUsLbh — Jessica (@koynlabs) February 6, 2026 The quick switch from buyer to seller suggests a short-term defensive move rather than a full exit. Instead of holding cash, ARK quickly moved the money into another crypto company. The firm bought about $17.8 million worth of shares in Bullish , an institutional-focused crypto trading platform listed on the NYSE in 2025. Since its listing, Bullish stock has struggled and is down more than 60%, while the company reported a Q4 net loss of $563.6 million on a GAAP basis. ARK appears to see value at these lower prices and is increasing its exposure. This shift shows that ARK is not leaving crypto, but rotating investments toward firms it believes have better growth potential. ARK Still Holds Large Coinbase Position Even after this sale, ARK remains one of the major investors in Coinbase. Across its main ETFs, the firm still owns about $312 million worth of COIN shares. The shift comes during a difficult time for crypto markets. Bitcoin recently dropped near $60,000, and trading volumes on exchanges have slowed. As a result, Coinbase stock has faced strong selling pressure, currently trading around $146 Trust with CoinPedia: CoinPedia has been delivering accurate and timely cryptocurrency and blockchain updates since 2017.

This marks a significant shift in strategy, as ARK had previously been consistently buying Coinbase shares on dips. The firm quickly reallocated these funds into Bullish, an institutional crypto trading platform, purchasing about $17.8 million worth of shares despite Bullish's own struggles (down 60% since listing and reporting significant Q4 losses).\n\nDespite this sale, ARK maintains a substantial position in Coinbase valued at approximately $312 million across its ETFs. This rotation rather than exit strategy suggests ARK remains committed to the crypto sector but is adjusting its investments toward companies it believes have better growth potential during the current market weakness, which has seen Bitcoin drop toward $60,000 and exchange trading volumes slow significantly.","aiSummaryThai":"ARK Invest ภายใต้การนำของ Cathie Wood ได้ขายหุ้น Coinbase มูลค่าประมาณ 17 ล้านดอลลาร์ หลังจากที่ราคาหุ้นดิ่งลงกว่า 40% ในช่วงเดือนที่ผ่านมา นี่ถือเป็นการเปลี่ยนแปลงกลยุทธ์ที่สำคัญ เนื่องจาก ARK เคยซื้อหุ้น Coinbase มาตลอดเมื่อราคาตกต่ำก่อนหน้านี้ บริษัทได้โอนเงินเข้าไปลงทุนใน Bullish ซึ่งเป็นแพลตฟอร์มการซื้อขายสินทรัพย์ดิจิทัลสำหรับสถาบัน โดยซื้อหุ้นมูลค่าประมาณ 17.8 ล้านดอลลาร์ แม้ว่า Bullish เองก็กำลังดิ้นรน (ราคาหุ้นลดลง 60% ตั้งแต่เข้าตลาดและรายงานขาดทุนไตรมาสที่ 4 อย่างหนัก)\n\nแม้จะขายหุ้น Coinbase ไปบางส่วน แต่ ARK ยังคงถือหุ้น Coinbase ในมูลค่าประมาณ 312 ล้านดอลลาร์ในกองทุน ETF ของตน การหมุนเวียนการลงทุนแทนที่จะถอนตัวออกจากตลาดนี้ ชี้ให้เห็นว่า ARK ยังคงภักดีต่อภาคส่วน crypto แต่กำลังปรับการลงทุนไปยังบริษัทที่เชื่อว่ามีศักยภาพการเติบโตที่ดีกว่าในช่วงที่ตลาดอ่อนแอ ซึ่ง Bitcoin ได้ตกลงมาใกล้ระดับ 60,000 ดอลลาร์ และปริมาณการซื้อขายในตลาดลดลงอย่างมีนัยสำคัญ","keyPoints":["ARK Invest sold $17M in Coinbase stock after its 40%+ price drop","The firm bought $17.8M in Bullish stock despite its own struggles","ARK still maintains a large $312M position in Coinbase","This represents a strategy rotation rather than exit from crypto","The move comes as Bitcoin drops toward $60,000 and trading volumes slow"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":517,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T13:05:38.977Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T13:05:38.977Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T16:20:38.799Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986cb9038f2116917d85623","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:17:35.000Z","slug":"hyperliquid-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-will-hype-price-hit-a-new-ath","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Hyperliquid Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Will HYPE Price Hit A New ATH?","translatedTitle":"คาดการณ์ราคา Hyperliquid 2026, 2027 – 2030: ราคา HYPE จะทะลุขีดจำกัดใหม่ได้ไหม?"},{"_id":"6986c80a38f2116917d8356e","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:47.000Z","slug":"pi-coin-price-prediction-what-next-after-altcoin-rejects-0190-retest","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"Pi coin price prediction – What next after altcoin rejects $0.190 retest?","translatedTitle":"คาดการณ์ราคะเหรียญ Pi - จะเกิดอะไรขึ้นหลังจากเหรียญอัลติคอยน์ปฏิเสธการทดสอบราคาที่ $0.190 อีกครั้ง?"},{"_id":"6986cde738f2116917d86b48","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:01.000Z","slug":"crypto-firms-raise-258m-despite-2-trillion-market-drawdown","source":"DL News","title":"Crypto firms raise $258m despite $2 trillion market drawdown ","translatedTitle":"บริษัทคริปโตระดมทุน 258 ล้านดอลลาร์ แม้ตลาดสูญเสีย 2 ล้านล้านดอลลาร์"},{"_id":"6986b9fb38f2116917d7aaf3","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T04:00:36.000Z","slug":"fartcoin-how-648m-whale-sell-off-hurt-the-memecoins-price","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"FARTCOIN: How $64.8M whale sell-off hurt the memecoin’s price","translatedTitle":"FARTCOIN: การขายครึ่งแสนล้านของ Whale ทำให้ราคา memecoin ตกลง"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
