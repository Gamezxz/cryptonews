f:T689,Several Ethereum whales are at risk of major liquidations as ETH trades near $1,900. Trend Research leads with 356,000 ETH ($671 million) vulnerable between $1,562 and $1,698, followed by Joseph Lubin with 293,000 ETH ($553 million) and the “7 Siblings” group with 287,000 ETH ($541 million) exposed near $1,029 to $1,075. Trend Research recently sold 170,000 ETH ($322 million) and repaid $344 million in loans, reducing exposure. If ETH prices drop further, forced liquidations could trigger sell-offs, though adding collateral may help whales avoid wipeouts.

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the BTC held by these ETFs has only decreased by approximately 7%, from 1.362 million to 1.272 million BTC. Global BTC ETF holdings showed similar strength, dropping by just 4.8% from 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC over the same period, indicating that investors, primarily 'boomers', are holding firm despite market volatility.

Bitcoin recently fell to $60K for the first time since October 2024, though it slightly recovered to $65K at press time. While BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced a record trading volume of $10 billion alongside a 13% price drop, analysts are divided about whether the market has reached its bottom. Chris Burniske expects further downside to levels around $58K or $50K, while Bitfinex analysts suggest that without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any upward movement might only represent a lower high in a fragile market.12:Taef,กองทุน Bitcoin ETF ในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้แสดงความยืดหยุ่นอย่างน่าทึ่งแม้ในช่วงที่ราคา Bitcoin ลดลงกว่า 50% ตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2025 ตามที่ Eric Balchunas นักวิเคราะห์ ETF จาก Bloomberg ระบุ ปริมาณ Bitcoin ที่ถือโดยกองทุนเหล่านี้ลดลงเพียงประมาณ 7% เท่านั้น จาก 1.362 ล้านเหรียญเป็น 1.272 ล้านเหรียญ การถือครอง Bitcoin ETF ทั่วโลกก็แสดงความแข็งแกร่งในทำนองเดียวกัน โดยลดลงเพียง 4.8% จาก 1.50 ล้านเป็น 1.428 ล้านเหรียญ ซึ่งชี้ให้เห็นว่านักลงทุน ส่วนใหญ่เป็น "ผู้สูงอายุ" ยังคงถือหุ้นอย่างมั่นคงแม้ในช่วงที่ตลาดผันผวน

Bitcoin เพิ่งลดลงสู่ระดับ $60K เป็นครั้งแรกนับตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2024 แม้ว่าจะฟื้นตัวกลับมาเล็กน้อยสู่ระดับ $65K ในขณะที่เขียนข่าว แม้ว่ากองทุน Bitcoin ETF ของ BlackRock จะมีมูลค่าการซื้อขายสูงสุดในรอบวันที่ $10 พันล้าน พร้อมกับการลดราคา 13% นักวิเคราะห์ยังคงแบ่งความเห็นเกี่ยวกับว่าตลาดได้ผ่านจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือไม่ Chris Burniske คาดการณ์ว่าจะมีการปรับตัวลดลงต่อไปยังระดับประมาณ $58K หรือ $50K ในขณะที่นักวิเคราะห์จาก Bitfinex ชี้ให้เห็นว่าหากไม่มีความต้องการในการซื้อขายและกระแสเงินทุนจากกองทุน ETF ที่แข็งแกร่งขึ้น การเคลื่อนไหวขาขึ้นใดๆ อาจเป็นเพียงจุดสูงสุดที่ต่ำกว่าในตลาดที่อ่อนแอ13:Tb48,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively resilient despite the crypto asset’s +50% price decline. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the overall BTC held by the ETFs dropped by only about 7%. He viewed the holders, mainly boomers, as ‘diamond hands.’ “Bitcoin’s price is down 44% from October high, but the amount of BTC held by the ETFs is only down 6.6%. Boomer strong.” Source: X Before the October crash, the U.S spot BTC ETFs held a record high of 1.362 million BTC. This stash had since dropped to 1.272 million BTC by the 4th of February. Can ETFs withstand the pressure? When zoomed out to the global holdings of BTC ETFs (covering offerings in the U.S, E.U., Asia, and others), the same picture emerged. Over the same period, global BTC ETF holdings dropped by only 72,400 BTC from October’s high of 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC. That’s only a 4.8% drop in BTC holdings. Source: BOLD report Put differently, the market fears and outflows in the past few weeks have not led to a massive drop in BTC held by ETFs. However, the asset extended its price decline over the past 24 hours, tagging $60K for the first time since October 2024. Although BTC price had moved up slightly to $65K at press time, there was still uncertainty about whether it had reached its final market bottom. Source: Bloomberg That said, the latest dump saw BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) post its record daily trading volume of $10 billion and its second-worst price drop 13%. For Balchunas , this was ‘brutal,’ further raising questions about the ETF buyers’ ability to remain resilient if markets go lower. Is $60K the market bottom? Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a VC partner at Placeholder and former Ark Invest crypto lead, said the sub-$60K levels were of ‘interest’ but expected an extra downside. “Watching with interest, but not buying yet. Expect a bounce, but doubt the bloodletting is done.” Chris nailed the October market top and the ensuing drawdown. He had projected that the market could bottom near $58K or $50K (levels that aligned with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and on-chain cost basis. For their part, Bitfinex analysts appeared hopeful that the market was not in a better position to form a bottom after the price dropped below the previous cycle peak of $69K. But they also echoed Burniske’s caution, “Order books show most demand under $66k as support bids were hit or pulled. That can set up a relief bounce, but without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any move risks being just a lower high in a fragile market.” Source: Bitfinex Final Thoughts BTC held by U.S spot ETFs has dropped by only 7% despite BTC’s +50% price decline since October 2025 Despite the extended dip to $60K-$65K zone, analysts appeared cautiously optimistic for a potential BTC bottom.14:Tcd7,Cover image via U.Today Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Founder of the HEX platform Richard Heart has taken to Twitter to comment on the current crypto bloodbath in the market and say that he does not believe Bitcoin to be the best cryptocurrency out there. Among the projects that Heart reckons to surpass BTC, the crypto entrepreneur named Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum. "Ethereum is better than Bitcoin" Heart published an S-curve (also known as the S-shaped curve or sigmoid curve) which visualizes how new tech, innovations, products, etc., spread around the community and become adopted by the population or within the market over time. HOT Stories I've been telling you Bitcoin was at the top of its S curve for several years now. Which means that, if you want to make mad gains, you might want to buy something better, with more potential. PulseChain is better. Ethereum is better. PLSX, HEX, and ProveX, when it comes out… pic.twitter.com/QCZedimVUZ — Richard Heart (@RichardHeartWin) February 6, 2026 Heart claims (not for the first time, according to his tweet) that Bitcoin has been at the top of its S-curve for several years already. This means that BTC is already at its mature stage, according to Heart – it has a vast support, and all users who will ever need it already have it, the growth in new users is slowing down drastically. Basically, Heart is certain that Bitcoin has nowhere much to grow in terms of new users and adoption. He claimed that gains can hardly be made with Bitcoin; other coins are much better suited for that. One of those, according to Heart, is Ethereum, since it has more technical potential. The entrepreneur added that the real quality and utility of a cryptocurrency does not make it a popular market asset. It is rather true about its price: “Price is a function of marketing and whether people decide to press green or red buttons.” You Might Also Like Bitcoin recovers to $66,000 Over the past day, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has managed to put up a recovery of 5.26%, returning to the $66,000 level. However, this recovery was preceded by a mammoth 30.55% collapse over the past week. On Wednesday, January 28, Bitcoin lost the $90,000 price line and began to decline rapidly, eventually landing at the $63,000 level per coin. This price collapse coincided with the 30% crash of gold and silver on January 30 after these precious metals reached new all-time highs above $5,000 and $100, respectively. Two other major reasons of the Bitcoin crash, according to analysts, have been the poor reports of the Magnificent 7 (which triggered investor fears around the AI bubble) and the fact of Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh, known for his hawkish stance on monetary policy, for the position of the new Fed chairman.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985838138f2116917bc7f9d","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=567973","__v":0,"author":"Ishika Kumari","categories":["ethereum"],"category":"ethereum","content":"Ethereum's price may be nearing a critical inflection point.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T06:00:33.319Z","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/OG-whale-seems-to-be-buying-ETH-again.webp","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T06:00:33.320Z","link":"https://ambcrypto.com/og-whale-who-lost-250m-last-week-is-already-buying-eth-again-heres-why/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T06:00:15.000Z","sentiment":"bullish","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"วาฬ OG ที่ขาดทุน $250M เมื่อสัปดาห์ที่แล้วกลับมาซื้อ ETH อี","title":"OG whale who lost $250M last week is already buying ETH again – Here’s why","translatedContent":"ราคา Ethereum อาจใกล้จะถึงจุดเปลี่ยนที่สำคัญ","translatedTitle":"OG whale ที่สูญเสีย 250 ล้านเหรียญสัปดาห์ที่แล้ว กลับมาซื้อ ETH อีกครั้งแล้ว – นี่คือเหตุผล","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:30:38.107Z"},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6985d0df38f2116917cacaa4","guid":"https://coinpedia.org/?p=541908","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Ethereum whales are facing significant liquidation risks as ETH trades near $1,900, with over $1.7 billion in potential liquidations at stake.
