4:T7f3,Zoe Gralinska-Sakai has joined XTB online investing as
Head of Regional Marketing for the UK, France and Italy, according to an update
on her LinkedIn profile. She is based in Warsaw, where the Polish-founded
brokerage is growing its international footprint.
Joining XTB amid Expanding European Footprint
She joins the broker amid an ongoing expansion push, with XTB expecting to serve more than 2 million users globally through its multi-asset
investment app.
"Turning the page! Excited to share I've joined XTB
online investing as Head of Regional Marketing for the UK, France and Italy," she mentioned. "Focused on growth, strengthening local relevance, and
delivering a mission of enabling financial freedom by making investing more
accessible."
Gralinska-Sakai moves to XTB after more than three
years at Revolut, where she held several senior marketing roles in Poland and
remotely. Most recently, she served as Global Brand Marketing Manager,
following a previous position as Creative Marketing Manager focused on regional
growth in Central and Eastern Europe.

Ad Spend Soars and Margins Tighten
The latest appointment comes as XTB rapidly scales its marketing activity, with 2025 spending on promotion and branding surging by PLN
240.2 million year‑on‑year to PLN 585 million. It comes as the group roll out broad
multi‑market campaigns and sponsorships, including its largest‑ever global
branding push in the second half. 
The push delivered a sharp expansion in the client
base, with total clients jumping to 2,164,867 in 2025 from 1,361,564 a year
earlier, supported by 864,286 new client additions, a 73% increase versus 2024.

However, the marketing‑led expansion has weighed on
profitability, contributing to a 24% drop in net profit to PLN 643.8 million
and a 15% decline in EBIT to PLN 834.3 million in 2025, even as total operating
income rose 15% to PLN 2,146.8 million.
