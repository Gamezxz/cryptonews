4:T81f,Capital Index UK Limited, a UK-based CFD broker, has changed
its legal name to Vantos Markets UK Limited, according to filings published by
Companies House.
The rebrand follows a period of financial pressure for the
UK arm of the broker. Capital
Index UK reduced its losses in 2024, returning to a pre-tax profit
position, although it remained loss-making after tax amid a challenging retail
trading environment.
Companies House Confirms Broker Name Change
The name change was registered today (Thursday), following a
special resolution passed by the company’s members a day earlier. The company
remains incorporated in England and Wales as a private company limited by
shares and continues to operate under the same company number.
Companies House issued a new certificate of incorporation
reflecting the updated name under the Companies Act. The filing indicates that
the change was authenticated electronically by the Registrar of Companies and
does not reference any amendments to the firm’s corporate structure or
ownership.
CFD Broker Rebrands Without Regulatory Changes
Capital Index has operated as an FCA-regulated provider of
contracts for difference, offering leveraged trading across multiple asset
classes. The Companies House documents do not suggest that the rebrand is
accompanied by changes to the firm’s regulatory permissions or business
activities.
The company has not publicly disclosed the rationale behind
the rebranding, and no further details were provided in the filing.
UK CFD Broker Reports Net Loss
For the year ended 31 December 2024, the company reported a
pre-tax profit of £23,678, compared with a pre-tax loss of £207,006 a year
earlier. However, it still recorded a net loss of £18,247 after tax, marking a
second consecutive year without net profitability. 
Turnover declined by more
than 17% year-on-year, while administrative costs continued to outweigh gross
profit, with directors citing cost-of-living pressures and weaker client
activity in the UK market.
