4:T12c8,By NFTevening January 23, 2026 Key Takeaways Sentient Labs builds the GRID, an open-source network democratizing AGI through a unified system of over 110 partners. The project secured an $85 million seed round led by Founders Fund and Pantera Capital, signaling strong institutional confidence. Sentient (SENT) officially launched on Binance Spot on January 22, 2026. Binance has officially integrated Sentient (SENT) into its spot trading ecosystem, marking a major milestone for decentralized AI. Following an intensive transition from the Binance Alpha Market, SENT Spot Trading officially commenced on January 22, 2026, at 12:00 (UTC). Due to the project’s status as a high-innovation frontier, Binance has applied the Seed Tag to all SENT pairs. Learn more: Cryptocurrency – Meaning & Deep Dive About Sentient (SENT): The Open AGI Economy Sentient Labs is an ambitious open-source research organization dedicated to building the Open AGI Economy. For decades, the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been shrouded in secrecy within centralized laboratories. Sentient flips this script by creating a platform where developers can build, share, and monetize AI models while maintaining full digital sovereignty, including three core pillars: The OML Framework (Open, Monetizable, Loyal): Traditional open-source models often suffer from a “leech” problem: once a model is released, others can use it without contributing back or rewarding the original creator. Sentient solves this using blockchain-based loyalty mechanisms. Open: Accessible to everyone without gatekeepers. Monetizable: Creators earn every time others use or fine-tune their model. Loyal: The AI remains committed to the user’s intent and the creator’s rights via smart contracts. The GRID – Decentralized Distribution Layer: Technically, Sentient operates through The GRID, which means Global Research and Intelligence Directory. Think of it as a massive, global neural network where thousands of nodes contribute data, compute power, and specialized algorithms. Unlike centralized platforms (like OpenAI or Google) that can de-platform users or change terms of service overnight, The GRID is permissionless and censorship-resistant. Sentient Chat & User Privacy: Users interact with this ecosystem through Sentient Chat, a gateway that allows anyone to access high-level AI capabilities, ranging from complex coding to scientific research, without surrendering their data privacy. Users’ data is not available to train a corporate model unless they explicitly choose to contribute it to the network for rewards. GRID is the world’s largest network of intelligence. Source: Sentient Labs Supported by heavyweights like Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, and Framework Ventures, Sentient are able to ensure that as AI becomes more powerful than ever, it remains “loyal” to humanity’s collective interests rather than a corporate bottom line. SENT Token Details The SENT token is the utility engine that powers the Open AGI Economy, with a total supply of 34,359,738,368 SENT. SENT serves as the coordination layer for the entire Sentient network, performing several critical functions that sustain the ecosystem. Primarily, it acts as the utility currency for “The GRID,” where users spend SENT to access high-performance AI inference, data services, and specialized models. Beyond simple payments, developers and users can stake SENT on the agents and models they believe are most valuable to signal quality, effectively “upvoting” reliable tools while becoming eligible for yield-bearing rewards. Furthermore, SENT also empowers decentralized governance, allowing holders to participate in the Sentient DAO. Community & Airdrop: 44.00% (30% unlocked at TGE, 70% over 4 years). Ecosystem & R&D: 19.55% (30% unlocked at TGE, 70% over 4 years). Team: 22.00% (1-year cliff, followed by a 6-year linear vest). Investors: 12.45% (1-year cliff, followed by a 4-year linear vest). Public Sale: 2.00% (Fully unlocked at TGE). Annual Emission: 2.00% cap to reward continuous GRID contributions.
