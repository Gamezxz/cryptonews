4:Tf9c,Ethereum price crashes 29% to May 2025 lows amid panic selling. On chain data shows $1.2 billion losses and long term holders selling. Oversold conditions could fuel rebound if Ethereum reclaims $2,000 support soon decisively. Ethereum has suffered a sharp correction, with price falling nearly 29% over the past week and slipping below the $2,000 mark. ETH is now trading at levels last seen nine months ago, reflecting severe weakness across the market. Diminishing buyer support has worsened conditions, with on-chain data confirming growing stress among Ethereum holders. Sponsored Sponsored Ethereum Holders Move Back To Selling Ethereum holders have increasingly resorted to panic selling as broader market conditions deteriorated. On-chain data from the Realized Profit/Loss indicator shows investors selling despite being underwater. Realized losses surged past $1.2 billion within 24 hours, highlighting widespread capitulation as holders prioritize risk reduction over recovery. Such elevated realized losses often extend declines by reinforcing negative momentum. As more ETH is sold at a loss, the price faces additional downward pressure. This behavior suggests confidence remains fragile, limiting the ability of Ethereum to stabilize until selling activity meaningfully subsides across the network. Want more token insights like this?

Source: Glassnode ETH Long-Term Investors Change Stance Long-term holder behavior reflects similar stress. The HODLer Net Position Change has declined, with bars flipping red, signaling net outflows from long-term wallets. This shift is notable because long-term holders are typically considered the backbone of Ethereum’s market structure and price stability. Sponsored Sponsored When long-term holders distribute rather than accumulate, it often signals deep concern. Their decision to sell amid mounting losses indicates rising panic even among conviction-driven investors. This development adds macro-level pressure and increases the risk that Ethereum’s decline could deepen before a meaningful recovery begins. Ethereum HODLer Position Change. Source: Glassnode ETH Price Could Note A Reversal Ethereum price is trading near $1,920 at the time of writing after a 29% drop in one week. The move below $2,000 has reinforced bearish structure across multiple timeframes. Given the prevailing on-chain and sentiment indicators, ETH remains vulnerable to additional downside in the near term. ETH is currently holding above the $1,796 support level. If this level fails, price could slide toward $1,671 or lower. Ethereum is already at a nine-month low, last seen in May 2025, increasing the risk of further liquidation-driven selling if support breaks. Ethereum Price Analysis. Source: TradingView A recovery scenario remains possible if selling pressure eases. Ethereum could reclaim $2,000, supported by oversold conditions. The Money Flow Index sits well below the 20.0 threshold, indicating selling pressure has likely saturated. Historically, such readings have preceded short-term relief rallies. Ethereum MFI. Source: TradingView A similar rebound could unfold if investors refrain from further selling. Holding supply off exchanges may allow ETH to regain momentum. Under this scenario, Ethereum could push beyond $2,000 and advance toward $2,500. Securing that move would invalidate the bearish thesis and restore market confidence.
