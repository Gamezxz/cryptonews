4:T884,Luis Raposo dos Santos is now the Chief Executive
Officer for Portugal at Trade Nation, according to an update on
his LinkedIn profile. He will be based in Lisbon, where the broker is building a
dedicated local presence.
Last year, Trade Nation established a new entity in the region, announcing recruitment for several key positions to support
the operation. The advertised roles were largely compliance-focused,
including a Head of Compliance, Risk Manager, and System Administrator.
Trade Nation Strengthens EU Presence
Before joining Trade Nation, dos Santos was Sales Director, LATAM at Finalto, based in London. He previously served as Global Business Development Head at Markets.com and Head of Partnerships at Vida Markets. Earlier in his career, he was UK Head of Client Services & On-Boarding at Trading 212 and also held roles at IG Group.
Trade Nation has been strengthening its leadership in the recent past through several high-profile appointments. Philippe Capelle joined as
Chief Marketing Officer. 
Other hires include Kypros Zoumidou, who joined as Managing
Director, and Chief Executive Officer Jon Noble, both of whom previously held
senior roles at the London-listed broker IG. Commenting on the hires, Noble mentioned that “we have some ambitious strategic plans to develop Trade Nation, and having Kyp on board will really help us move the business to the next level.”
Trade Nation Swings Back to Profit in the UK
In the UK the broker recently reported a return to profitability in its operations, posting a net profit of £996,766 for the financial year
ending 30 November 2024, compared with a net loss of £2.2 million a year
earlier.
 This turnaround was
underpinned by a rise in revenue to £21.7 million from £13.4 million, while
gross profit increased to £18.1 million from £13.1 million despite sales and
hedging-related costs.
Operating profit reached £636,136, a significant improvement
on the £2.6 million operating loss recorded in the previous year. The bottom
line was further supported by a reduction in the tax charge to £48,778, down
from £332,867 in 2023.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
