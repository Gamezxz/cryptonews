4:Tae6,Veteran trader Peter Brandt said Bitcoin could be approaching a potential downside floor, arguing that past bear market patterns suggest losses may be limited from current levels. Summary Veteran trader Peter Brandt said Bitcoin may be nearing a downside floor, pointing to past bear market cycles that suggest losses could be limited near the $42,000 level. Brandt referenced a long-term “banana peel” support zone on his chart, which has historically marked areas where Bitcoin’s deepest drawdowns struggled to extend further. The comments come amid a broader crypto market downturn, with Bitcoin and major altcoins under sustained selling pressure. “If Bitcoin digs into the banana peel as deeply as in past bear market cycles, then the bulls should not need to suffer too far south of $42,000,” Brandt wrote on X. “We are a hop, skip and jump from there.” Brandt accompanied the post with a long-term Bitcoin ( BTC ) chart showing price action relative to what he describes as a “banana peel” support zone, a curved lower boundary that has historically contained Bitcoin’s deepest drawdowns . Bitcoin long-term price action and ‘banana peel’ support zone | Source: Peter Brandt Brandt’s “banana peel” metaphor refers to the slippery downside zone, where price can slide quickly but has historically struggled to sustain deep breaks below it. In the current cycle, that lower boundary sits near the $42,000 level, implying Bitcoin may be nearing a historically significant area of support. Brandt flags Bitcoin ‘campaign selling’ in prior warning Brandt’s latest post follows a separate tweet from the previous day, in which he said Bitcoin’s recent price action appeared to reflect “campaign selling” rather than retail-driven capitulation. In that earlier post, Brandt pointed to a multi-day pattern of lower highs and lower lows, suggesting that large, coordinated sellers may be driving the decline. He added that similar patterns have appeared in past market cycles, though timing a bottom remains uncertain. Hey crypto followers $BTC The nature of the decline in Bitcoin (now 8 days of lower lows and highs) has all the finger prints of campaign selling, not retail liquidation Seen this before hundreds of times over the decades Never know when of course this pattern ends Note to trolls… pic.twitter.com/THGJpez35F — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) February 5, 2026 Together, the two tweets frame a cautious outlook: further downside may be possible, but historical behavior could limit how far prices fall. The comments come as Bitcoin continues to slide alongside a broader crypto market downturn, with prices under pressure across major digital assets. Major altcoins have followed Bitcoin lower, amplifying losses across the sector.0:{"buildId":"nyNMduq-QDcIzXqHG9EwS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33832","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448574","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests Bitcoin is approaching a potential downside floor near the $42,000 level.
