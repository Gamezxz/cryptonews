The brokerage also offers one of the market’s most competitive introducing broker and partnership programs, enhanced by its exclusive GTC VIP Loyalty Program—rewarding high-volume traders and long-term partners with premium rebates, priority service, and tailored account privileges.
A Partnership-Driven Brokerage Model
While tight spreads and fast execution have become industry standards, sustainable growth depends on transparent partnership structures and predictable economics.
 GTCFX has built its business around long-term collaboration, offering multi-tier partnership models, flexible rebate structures, and regional business support that enable partners to scale with confidence.
This partnership-first strategy has helped GTCFX grow to nearly one million clients worldwide, supported by strong regulatory governance and a clear commitment to transparency and trust.
Institutional-Grade Liquidity Designed for Scale

The brokerage provides:
• Deep global liquidity pools
• Direct connectivity to top-tier liquidity providers
• Up to 10 levels of market depth

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
