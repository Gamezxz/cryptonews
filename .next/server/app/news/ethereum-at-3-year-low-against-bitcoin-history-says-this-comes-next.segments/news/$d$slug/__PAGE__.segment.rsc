4:Tfdb,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 As the big caps keep breaking support and major unwinds hit, investors are rushing to hedge their risk. Historically, moves like this often push capital into altcoins as a safety valve against volatility. Notably, the altcoin market is holding steady around the 40 mark. The Altcoin Season Index hasn’t taken any major hits, which tells us that capital rotation into alternative assets is quietly happening under the surface. That said, a full-blown altcoin season is still far off. Ethereum [ETH] dominance has slipped back to 2021 levels, and $2,100 has just given way. It looks like ETH is setting up for another rough run against Bitcoin [BTC] . Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) As the chart showed, the ETH/BTC ratio hasn’t seen a single green year since 2022 and is already down 12% so far this year. Naturally, the question arises: Is Ethereum losing its “hedge” status year after year? On the bullish side, BitMine (BMNR) has been stacking ETH, sparking some FOMO. So far, though, it hasn’t moved the price. To make matters worse, BMNR is now sitting on a record $7 billion in unrealized losses . Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin made headlines by selling 2,779 ETH for $6.22 million over the past three days, at an average price of $2,238. All this is adding fuel to the ongoing Ethereum FUD, keeping the market on edge. As a result, with every support taken out, ETH’s risk keeps climbing. In this context, traders have to weigh Ethereum’s vulnerabilities against potential upside elsewhere, putting ETH’s support at higher stakes than its rivals. Ethereum traders weigh ETH risk vs reward against rivals Zoom out, and Ethereum is already losing ground to its counterparts. At the macro level, ETH’s yearly returns have dropped to -30%, the worst among other high-cap altcoins. Add back-to-back FUD headlines and recent selling by major players , and holding onto ETH starts to feel riskier. On-chain, the weakness is showing too. Ethereum’s buy/sell delta has flipped red for the first time since the “Liberation Day” FUD in Q2 2025, signaling selling pressure is taking over and sentiment is turning cautious. Source: Alphractal Taken together, the current setup is clearly skewed toward risk. Against this setup, the ETH/BTC ratio falling 12% isn’t a fluke. Traders are rotating capital, as highlighted by the Altcoin Season Index , suggesting that while Ethereum struggles, the altcoin market is quietly holding its ground. In this context, the $2k ETH support level remains at high risk. Another meaningful push up against Bitcoin and other altcoins looks unlikely right now, with the ETH/BTC ratio set to continue its downtrend deeper into Q1. Final Thoughts With support levels breaking, Ethereum is facing rising risk, internal FUD, and heavy selling, making it harder to hold dominance against Bitcoin. Traders are rotating capital into altcoins, showing that while ETH struggles, alternative assets are holding their ground.

The asset has underperformed major peers with yearly returns dropping to -30%, raising questions about its status as a reliable hedge. Negative sentiment is driving the decline, fueled by Vitalik Buterin's recent sale of 2,779 ETH and BitMine sitting on $7 billion in unrealized losses.\n\nWhile Ethereum struggles, traders are rotating capital into the broader altcoin market, which has remained steady despite the volatility. On-chain data confirms selling pressure is intensifying, signaling that the downtrend is likely to continue deeper into Q1. Consequently, Ethereum's risk profile is rising compared to its rivals, making the $2k support level a critical point to watch.","aiSummaryThai":"Ethereum กำลังเผชิญกับแรงกดดันอย่างหนัก เมื่ออัตราส่วน ETH/BTC ตกลงสู่จุดต่ำสุดในรอบหลายปีและแนวรับสำคัญที่ระดับ $2,100 ได้แตกลง สินทรัพย์นี้มีผลตอบแทนต่อปีดิ่งลงถึง -30% ซึ่งแย่ที่สุดเมื่อเทียบกับสินทรัพย์หลักอื่นๆ จนทำให้เกิดคำถามเกี่ยวกับสถานะของ Ethereum กระแสข่าวลบ (FUD) และแรงขายกำลังเร่งตัว โดยมีปัจจัยมาจากการที่ Vitalik Buterin ขาย ETH จำนวนมาก และ BitMine มีมูลค่าขาดทุนยังไม่เกิดจริงสูงถึง $7 พันล้าน\n\nขณะที่ Ethereum กำลังดิ้นรน นักเทรดได้หมุนเวียนเงินทุนไปยังตลาด altcoin อื่นๆ ซึ่งยังคงมีความมั่นคงอยู่แม้จะเกิดความผันผวน ข้อมูล on-chain ยืนยันว่าแรงขายกำลังครอบงำ ซึ่งบ่งชี้ว่าแนวโน้มการปรับตัวลงมีแนวโน้มจะดำเนินต่อไปในไตรมาสแรก ด้วยเหตุนี้ ความเสี่ยงของ Ethereum จึงเพิ่มสูงขึ้นเมื่อเทียบกับคู่แข่ง และทำให้แนวรับระดับ $2k กลายเป็นจุดสำคัญที่ต้องจับตามอง","fullContent":"$4","keyPoints":["ETH/BTC ratio hits multi-year lows with yearly returns at -30%","Selling pressure increases following Vitalik Buterin's sale and BitMine's unrealized losses","Traders are rotating capital from Ethereum to other altcoins as support levels break"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":628},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986922238f2116917d61ae2","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:41:39.000Z","slug":"nbc-today-show-hosts-mother-kidnapped-for-bitcoin-ransom","source":"BeInCrypto","title":"NBC Today Show Host’s Mother Kidnapped for Bitcoin Ransom?","translatedTitle":"แม่ของพิธีกรรายการ NBC Today ถูกลักพาตัวเพื่อเรียกค่าไถ่ด้วยบิตคอยน์?"},{"_id":"698689ef38f2116917d5b388","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:28:01.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-selloff-sparks-hedge-fund-speculation-around-blackrock-etf","source":"The Defiant","title":"Bitcoin Selloff Sparks Hedge Fund Speculation Around BlackRock ETF","translatedTitle":"การขาย Bitcoin ทำให้เกิดการคาดเดาเกี่ยวกกองทุนเฮดจ์ฟันด์ของ BlackRock ETF"},{"_id":"6986841238f2116917d57493","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:01:00.000Z","slug":"crypto-market-review-500000000-in-xrp-buying-volume-shiba-inu-shib-surprisingly-","source":"U.Today","title":"Crypto Market Review: $500,000,000 in XRP Buying Volume, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Surprisingly Bullish, Will Bitcoin (BTC) Be Saved Before $50,000?","translatedTitle":"รีวิวตลาดคริปโต: ปริมาณการซื้อ XRP ครั้งใหญ่ 500 ล้านดอลลาร์, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ทำกำไรได้น่าตื่นเต้น, Bitcoin (BTC) จะหลบหลีกจากการตกลงถึง 50,000 หรือไม่?"},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c3a","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:00:16.000Z","slug":"tether-bets-big-on-gold-with-150-million-investment-in-goldcom","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Tether Bets Big On Gold With $150 Million Investment In Gold.com","translatedTitle":"เทเธอร์ลงทุนในทองคำอย่างใหญ่หลวงด้วยการลงทุน 150 ล้านดอลลาร์ใน Gold.com"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
