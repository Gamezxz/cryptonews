4:Tb92,contributor Posted: February 5, 2026 Crypto portfolio management platform adds real-time position monitoring for three major perpetual trading protocols CoinStats has announced the integration of three perpetual decentralized exchanges. Aster , Hyperliquid , and Lighter are now available on the crypto portfolio tracker . Traders can monitor their derivative positions alongside spot holdings and centralized exchange balances. Traders can now track Perpetual DEX activity directly in CoinStats: Real-time balance updates Open positions Open orders Complete trade history and Profit & Loss analysis Mobile Access for Desktop-Bound Traders The integration addresses a common pain point for perpetual traders. Many have been tethered to desktop interfaces to monitor their positions. With the new functionality, users can track their perp activity from mobile devices. They can check positions and orders while away from their primary trading setup. “Perp traders live and die by timing,” the company noted in its announcement. The mobile-first approach allows traders to monitor their derivative exposure in one unified dashboard. Spot holdings, other DEX positions, and centralized exchange balances all appear in the same view. Why It Matters Perpetual DEX trading has grown significantly over the past year. More traders are moving away from centralized exchanges in favor of self-custody solutions. However, managing positions across multiple platforms has remained a challenge. Portfolio fragmentation makes it difficult to assess overall exposure and performance. With this integration, CoinStats aims to solve that problem. Traders no longer need to switch between different apps and websites to get a complete picture. Everything lives in one place. This consolidation saves time and reduces the risk of missing critical market movements. The addition of Aster, Hyperliquid, and Lighter also reflects the growing maturity of the perpetual DEX ecosystem. These platforms have gained traction among serious traders looking for decentralized alternatives. Native support in portfolio trackers signals broader industry recognition. Quick Setup Process Connecting accounts takes under a minute, according to CoinStats. Users can link their perpetual DEX accounts through the app or web dashboard. The process is simple: navigate to Portfolios, select “Add New,” and search for the desired platform. Positions sync immediately upon connection. Broader Platform Support The three new integrations join CoinStats’ existing infrastructure. The platform supports over 300 wallets and exchanges, 120 blockchains, and more than 1,000 DeFi protocols. The additions reflect growing demand for unified portfolio views. Traders increasingly spread activity across multiple protocols and trading venues. The updated tracking features are now available on iOS, Android, and web platforms.
