4:T1263,Arthur Hayes sent roughly 3.63 million ENA, valued near $487K, to Galaxy and Binance, pulling market attention toward centralized liquidity dynamics. This transfer introduced tradable supply at a time when ENA already traded under pressure, therefore forcing participants to reassess intent. Large transfers often spark distribution fears; however, in this case….context matters. The move coincided with steady spot demand rather than panic selling. Traders continue to interact aggressively on the bid, which changes how this inflow reads. Instead of signaling urgency to exit, the timing aligns with controlled liquidity rotation. The surrounding order-flow behavior now carries greater weight, especially as Ethena [ENA] price hovers near a structurally important zone. ENA coils inside descending regression channel At press time, ENA traded inside a well-defined descending regression channel on the 4-hour chart, with price compressing near the lower boundary around $0.132–$0.130. Sellers continue to defend the channel midline, therefore limiting upside follow-through after each bounce. However, downside progress was noticeably slow as price respects horizontal demand near $0.130. This behavior shows sellers losing urgency rather than buyers chasing aggressively. The structure still leans bearish, yet momentum weakens with each push lower. Besides, repeated defenses of the channel base reduce liquidation efficiency for shorts. As a result, price compression increased tension within the range. While the broader trend remained corrective, the market waited for a catalyst. Either supply overwhelms demand decisively, or absorption forces a structural reaction toward the channel midpoint. The MACD remains below zero, yet the histogram contracts near -0.003, signaling fading downside momentum. Sellers still control trend direction, however their push lacks acceleration. Momentum oscillations flatten instead of expanding, which often precedes consolidation rather than continuation. Source: TradingView Buyers keep absorbing despite exchange inflows Spot Taker CVD over the 90-day window stayed firmly buyer-dominant, showing aggressive market buys outweighing sells even after ENA reached exchanges. Buyers actively lift offers instead of waiting passively, therefore absorbing new supply efficiently. This behavior contradicts panic distribution narratives. If sellers controlled the flow, taker sells would expand sharply. Instead, bids remain persistent. Additionally, CVD fails to roll over during price weakness, reinforcing absorption rather than capitulation. This dynamic suggests larger players defend inventory zones rather than exit hastily. Consequently, Hayes’ transfer interacts with demand instead of overwhelming it. Sustained absorption often builds pressure beneath resistance, especially inside compressed structures. Therefore, order flow currently favors balance rather than breakdown, keeping rebound scenarios technically viable. Source: CryptoQuant Short liquidations stack above price The Liquidation Map revealed dense short-side leverage between $0.135 and $0.145, with cumulative exposure exceeding $3 million above spot. Below the price, liquidation density thins considerably. This imbalance creates asymmetric risk. If price grinds higher, forced buy-ins could accelerate movement quickly. However, shorts remain comfortable while the price stays capped. Each failed bounce encourages additional short positioning, therefore increasing vulnerability. Importantly, leverage clusters concentrate around the regression midline. A reclaim would not need explosive volume to trigger reactions. Even modest continuation could pressure overexposed shorts. As a result, downside follow-through offers diminishing returns, while upside reactions carry convex risk. The liquidation structure now amplifies the importance of absorption and stabilization signals. Source: CoinGlass To sum up, Arthur Hayes’ ENA transfer does not resemble aggressive distribution. Buyer-dominant Spot Taker CVD, slowing downside momentum, and heavy short-side leverage suggest the market continues to absorb supply efficiently. While ENA remains structurally constrained inside a descending channel, sellers no longer press with conviction. If absorption persists and price holds the lower boundary, ENA could stabilize and attempt a rebound rather than extend its decline, despite the added exchange liquidity. Final Thoughts The movement of 3.63 million ENA into Galaxy and Binance shifted attention to centralized liquidity, but market reactions stayed measured. Ethena continues to trade inside a descending regression channel, holding near the lower boundary around $0.130.0:{"buildId":"vBXxSHpcTX_AvF0vMO5h1","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853abc38f2116917acb69c","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=567708","__v":0,"author":"Erastus Chami","categories":["ethereum","defi"],"category":"ethereum","content":"ENA absorbs fresh exchange liquidity as buyers actively defend downside levels despite rising supply.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:04.668Z","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Erastus-2026-02-05T094709.068.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:04.669Z","link":"https://ambcrypto.com/ethena-absorbs-hayes-3-6mln-transfer-why-ena-refuses-to-break-down/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T00:00:36.000Z","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"Ethena ดูดซับสภาพคล่องจากการโอน 3.6 ล้านของ Hayes โดยผู้ซื้อป้องกันระดับลงอย่างแข็งขัน แม้จะมีอุปทานที่เพิ่มขึ้น","title":"Ethena absorbs Hayes’ 3.6mln transfer – Why ENA refuses to break down","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T13:45:47.059Z","translatedTitle":"Ethena ดูดซับการโอนเงิน 3.6 ล้านของเฮยส์ - ทำไม ENA ปฏิเสธที่จะแตกตัว","slug":"ethena-absorbs-hayes-36mln-transfer-why-ena-refuses-to-break-down","aiSummary":"Arthur Hayes transferred 3.63 million ENA to Galaxy and Binance, raising concerns about potential distribution, but market data suggests a controlled liquidity rotation rather than panic selling.
