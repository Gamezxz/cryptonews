4:T76e,The cryptocurrency market is facing one of the most significant corrections in the last few years. Bitcoin (BTC) is down to the $70,000 price level, and other assets are following its trajectory. While many missed out on the last market dip when BTC fell to the $15,000 price level in 2022, the current market dip could present another opportunity to buy assets for cheap and make big returns. Let’s look at three cryptocurrencies you could consider buying during the current market dip. Top 3 Cryptocurrencies To Buy During The Dip Source: WatcherGuru Bitcoin (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency and should be number one on your watchlist. BTC had incredible gains in 2026, hitting an all-time high of $126,080 in October of last year. While the asset has faced a steep price correction, many anticipate BTC to eventually breach the $1 million mark. BTC hitting $1 million would bring massive returns to you, if you purchase the asset at low prices. Also Read: Binance’s Buys $100 Million Bitcoin Dip: Should You? Another cryptocurrency to consider buying during the dip is Solana (SOL). SOL has had an incredible run over the last few years. Solana (SOL) has proven to be one of the most resilient cryptocurrencies in the market. Moreover, the Solana (SOL) network is emerging as a worthy contender to the Ethereum network. The cryptocurrency could see incredibly high prices in the future and current prices could be an excelent entry point for new and old investors. Dogecoin (DOGE) is the original memecoin that has come quite a long way in its 12-year history. While DOGE has faced its fair share of ups and downs, there is a chance that the cryptocurrency’s price will skyrocket in the future. Elon Musk, one of the biggest DOGE support, recently said that he wants to put an actual Dogecoin in the moon. If successful, the feat could lead to a massive price surge for the cryptocurrency.0:{"buildId":"rPzjts34cPPlDL88LESzh","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853ab738f2116917acb51d","guid":"https://watcher.guru/news/?p=230844","__v":0,"author":"Paigambar Mohan Raj","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"The cryptocurrency market is facing one of the most significant corrections in the last few years.
