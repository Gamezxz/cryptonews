4:Teb2,Today in crypto, Trend Research unloads over 400,000 ETH to repay loans, market sentiment dived to multi-year lows as Bitcoin sank and Polymarket partnered with Circle to bring native USDC payments to prediction markets. Trend Research dumps over 400K ETH as liquidation risk rises Ethereum investment vehicle Trend Research continued to reduce its Ether exposure, as the latest market crash pushed the treasury company to sell off its assets to pay back loans. It held about 651,170 Ether ( ETH ) in the form of Aave Ethereum wrapped Ether (AETHWETH) on Sunday. That amount dropped by 404,090, to about 247,080 on Friday, at the time of writing. Trend Research transferred 411,075 ETH to cryptocurrency exchange Binance since the beginning of the month, according to blockchain data platform Arkham.

Trend Research has been tied to Jack Yi, founder of Hong Kong-based crypto venture firm Liquid Capital. Yi accumulated his Ethereum investment company’s holdings by purchasing ETH at an exchange, using that as collateral on Aave to borrow stablecoins, then using those funds to acquire more ETH. Crypto sentiment hits 2022 lows as Bitcoin crashes to $60,000 Crypto market sentiment slumped to its lowest level in over three and a half years on Friday, returning to levels last seen during the massive Terra blockchain collapse, as Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a 24-hour low of $60,000. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to a score of 9 out of 100 on Friday, its lowest point since June 2022, when sentiment fell alongside the market in the wake of the collapse of the Terra blockchain a month earlier. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit a score of 9 out of 100 on Friday as Bitcoin continued to slide. Source: Alternative.me It came as Bitcoin had fallen around 13% over the past 24 hours and had lost over $10,000, its largest in a day since mid-2022. Its price hit a low of $60,000 on Coinbase late on Thursday, falling by over 50% from its peak of $126,000 in early October. CoinEx Research chief analyst Jeff Ko told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s drawdown comes alongside a selloff in US tech stocks, “where stretched valuations and lingering concerns around an artificial intelligence-driven bubble have long been highlighted by the market.” Polymarket, Circle partner to move prediction market to native USDC settlement Decentralized prediction market Polymarket has partnered with stablecoin issuer Circle to transition its platform to native USDC ( USDC ) settlement, replacing the bridged USDC.e currently used on Polygon. The move will see Polymarket shift away from bridge-based settlement infrastructure toward Circle-issued USDC, which is fully backed and redeemable for US dollars. According to the companies, the change is intended to reduce the complexity and risk associated with cross-chain bridges while improving capital efficiency. Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan said the transition supports a consistent, dollar-denominated settlement standard as the platform scales. The partnership reflects a broader trend in crypto toward native stablecoin settlement as onchain markets mature and infrastructure providers prioritize security and regulatory alignment.
