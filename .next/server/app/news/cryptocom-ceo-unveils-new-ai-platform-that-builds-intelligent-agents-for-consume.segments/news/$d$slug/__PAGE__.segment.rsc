4:T73e,AI-powered agents promise a revolution in personalized task execution by autonomously expanding their capabilities. Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, today announced the launch of ai.com, a new AI platform that allows consumers to create autonomous agents capable of executing tasks on their behalf. The platform enables users to generate private AI agents that can organize work, send messages, execute actions across apps, and build projects. A key feature is the agents’ ability to autonomously develop missing capabilities to complete tasks, with improvements shared across millions of agents on the network. “We are at a fundamental shift in AI’s evolution as we rapidly move beyond basic chats to AI agents actually getting things done for humans,” Marszalek said. “Our vision is a decentralized network of billions of agents who self-improve and share these improvements with each other, vastly and rapidly expanding agentic capabilities and accelerating the advent of AGI.” Users will soon be able to deploy agents to trade stocks, automate workflows, manage calendars, and perform other actions while maintaining privacy and control. All agents operate in secure environments with encrypted, user-specific data segregation. The platform will debut on February 8, alongside a commercial launch during Super Bowl LX on NBC. Users can start for free, with paid subscription tiers offering enhanced capabilities and increased input tokens. Marszalek acquired the ai.com domain in 2025 in what is believed to be the largest domain purchase in history. He will serve as CEO of both ai.com and Crypto.com, which has grown to over 150 million retail users. The platform is exploring future offerings including financial services integrations, agent marketplaces, and collaborative social networks.
