4:T9f7,Ripple's token has also surpassed BNB in terms of market cap after its sublime surge. It was just hours ago, less than a day, when we wrote about XRP’s spectacular collapse as the asset plummeted to $1.11 for the first time since before the US presidential elections at the end of 2024. This meant that it had shed over 50% of its value in a month as it peaked at $2.40 on January 6. Oh, how the landscape in crypto can change in hours sometimes, not even days or weeks. What happened with XRP’s price since that local low has been nothing short of amazing.

After all, the cross-border token skyrocketed by 37% in about 18 hours – going from the aforementioned low to $1.54 before it faced some resistance and now trades around $1.50. This still represents a 34% surge in less than a day. Santiment also weighed in on the token’s performance.

Since bottoming out below $1.15 just under 18 hours ago, the #4 market cap has now recovered to back above $1.50. 😱 Panic sellers should have stopped to notice the massive activity on the… pic.twitter.com/3y0eyGxpo2 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 6, 2026 You may also like: XRP Open Interest Hits Lowest Since November 2024: What This Means for Traders XRP ETFs Beat BTC, ETH, and SOL Funds – Yet Ripple’s Price Still Struggles What Happened to the XRP ETFs Last Week as Ripple’s Price Tumbled to $1.70? The ETF behavior will also be interesting to compare, but we would need to verify the data at the end of the trading day in the US.
