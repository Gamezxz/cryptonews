4:T132d,Solana’s price has rebounded from key support, but weak volume and heavy overhead resistance raise the risk that the current rally is only a temporary dead cat bounce. Summary $70 high-timeframe support triggered the bounce , but structure remains bearish Price is entering major resistance near $87 , with VWAP and Fibonacci confluence Low volume weakens the rally , raising rejection and downside rotation risk Solana ( SOL ) price action has staged a short-term recovery after respecting a major high-timeframe support zone near $70. While the bounce has provided brief relief following sustained selling pressure, the broader technical picture suggests caution is warranted. The recent advance has occurred on below-average volume and is now approaching a dense cluster of resistance, increasing the probability that this move may be corrective rather than the start of a sustained trend reversal. As Solana trades higher into key technical barriers, market participants are closely watching whether buyers can generate enough momentum to shift structure, or whether sellers will reassert control and rotate price back toward recent lows. Solana price key technical points $70 high-timeframe support has held , triggering a short-term bounce Current price is entering major resistance confluence , including VWAP and Fibonacci Low volume undermines the rally , increasing dead cat bounce risk SOLUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a higher-timeframe perspective, the $70 level has proven to be a significant area of demand for Solana. This zone has acted as a structural support level, and the recent defense of this region allowed price to stabilize and push higher on the intraday timeframe. Following the bounce, Solana reclaimed its local point of control, signaling short-term acceptance and encouraging a brief bullish reaction. However, while the bounce itself is technically valid, it must be viewed within the context of the broader trend. Solana remains in a bearish market structure, and isolated rallies from support do not automatically imply a trend reversal, particularly when other confirming signals are absent. Resistance confluence caps the upside As the price moved higher, Solana is now trading into a well-defined resistance zone around the $87 region. This area represents a significant confluence of technical factors, including the value area high, VWAP-based resistance, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the prior decline. Together, these levels form a supply zone where sellers are likely to become active. Historically, when price rallies into such confluence zones without strong volume confirmation, the probability of rejection increases. This is especially true in bearish market environments, where rallies often serve as opportunities for distribution rather than accumulation. Weak volume signals fragile rally One of the most important concerns surrounding the current Solana rally is the lack of bullish volume. Despite the price moving higher, participation has remained below average, suggesting that large buyers have not meaningfully stepped in. In healthy trend reversals, a rising price is typically accompanied by expanding volume, reflecting growing demand and conviction. In this case, the lack of strong volume suggests the move higher may be driven by short-covering or opportunistic buying rather than sustained accumulation. This dynamic aligns closely with the characteristics of a dead cat bounce — a temporary recovery within a broader downtrend that ultimately fails. Bearish structure remains intact below resistance As long as Solana remains below the current resistance cluster, the broader bearish market structure remains unchanged. Failure to reclaim and hold above this zone would keep downside rotation as the higher-probability scenario. A rejection from resistance would likely send the price back toward the $70 support, setting up a potential retest of that level. Repeated tests of support often weaken demand, increasing the risk of a breakdown if buyers fail to defend the zone convincingly. As a result, how price reacts to any return to $70 will be critical in determining whether Solana can stabilize or if further downside is likely. What to expect in the coming price action From a technical, price action, and market structure perspective, Solana’s current rally appears vulnerable. The combination of low volume and heavy resistance overhead suggests that downside risk remains elevated. A rejection near current levels would favor a rotation back toward $70, keeping the bearish structure intact. For the outlook to improve meaningfully, Solana would need to break above resistance with strong volume confirmation and sustain acceptance at higher value. Until that occurs, traders should treat the current move cautiously and remain focused on price behavior as Solana navigates this critical resistance zone.0:{"buildId":"KeHYDQY25qHpVDkQr8Q-V","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33817","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448712","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Solana’s price has rebounded from the $70 support level, but technical indicators suggest this rally could be a temporary 'dead cat bounce' rather than a sustained reversal. The recent upward move is characterized by weak trading volume and is approaching a significant resistance zone near $87, defined by the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Fibonacci retracement levels. The lack of strong buying conviction implies that the current price action may be driven by short-covering rather than genuine accumulation. Without a high-volume breakout above this resistance, the broader bearish market structure remains intact. Traders should remain cautious, as a rejection at current levels would likely lead to a downside rotation back toward the $70 support zone, increasing the risk of a deeper decline.","aiSummaryThai":"ราคา Solana ได้ดีดตัวขึ้นจากแนวรับระยะยาวที่ระดับ $70 แต่ความอ่อนแอของปริมาณการซื้อขายและแรงต้านที่หนักแน่นทำให้มีความเสี่ยงว่าการฟื้นตัวครั้งนี้อาจเป็นเพียง dead cat bounce เท่านั้น ขณะนี้ราคากำลังเข้าสู่บริเวณต้านสำคัญใกล้ระดับ $87 ซึ่งเป็นจุดบรรจบของแนวต้าน VWAP และ Fibonacci และการขาดนักซื้อรายใหญ่ที่เข้ามาสนับสนุนสะท้อนให้เห็นว่าแรงของการฟื้นตัวยังคงเปราะบาง ตราบใดที่ราคายังอยู่ใต้แนวต้านชุดนี้ โครงสร้างตลาดแนวโน้มขาลงก็ยังคงไม่เปลี่ยนแปลง หากถูกผลักดันกลับลง ราคาจะมีแนวโน้มหมุนกลับไปทดสอบแนวรับ $70 อีกครั้ง ซึ่งหากแนวรับนี้แตก จะทำให้ราคาดิ่งลงไปได้ลึกกว่าเดิม","author":"Aziz Zamani","categories":["altcoins"],"category":"altcoins","content":"Solana price has rebounded from key support, but weak volume and heavy resistance overhead raise the risk that the current rally is only a temporary dead cat bounce.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T21:04:38.615Z","enclosure":"https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/04/crypto-news-Solana-Toronto-option02.webp","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T21:04:38.317Z","fullContent":"$4","keyPoints":["Solana bounced from $70 support but risks being a dead cat bounce due to low volume","Price faces major resistance near $87, driven by VWAP and Fibonacci confluence","Bearish structure remains intact; rejection at resistance could lead to a retest of $70"],"link":"https://crypto.news/solana-price-risks-a-dead-cat-bounce-as-recent-rally-lacks-volume/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T17:50:24.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"bearish","slug":"solana-price-risks-a-dead-cat-bounce-as-recent-rally-lacks-volume","source":"Crypto.news","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"Solana price risks a dead cat bounce as recent rally lacks volume","translatedContent":"ราคา Solana ได้ดีดตัวกลับมาจากแนวรับสำคัญ แต่ปริมาณการซื้อขายที่อ่อนแอและแนวต้านหนักทางด้านบนเพิ่มความเสี่ยงที่การพุ่งขึ้นครั้งนี้อาจเป็นเพียง Dead Cat Bounce ชั่วคราว","translatedTitle":"ราคา Solana เสี่ยงที่จะเกิด Dead Cat Bounce เมื่อการพุ่งขึ้นล่าสุดขาดปริมาณการซื้อขาย","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T05:50:19.167Z","wordCount":738},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986cf1438f2116917d87744","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:59.000Z","slug":"bitrue-expands-xrp-infrastructure-as-10-new-rlusd-pairs-go-live","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Bitrue Expands XRP Infrastructure as 10 New RLUSD Pairs Go Live","translatedTitle":"Bitrue ขยายโครงสร้าง XRP เมื่อ 10 คู่ใหม่ของ RLUSD เปิดใช้งาน"},{"_id":"6986d16c38f2116917d8b420","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:00.000Z","slug":"xrp-still-in-bull-market-versus-bitcoin-and-xrpbtc-chart-puts-51-upside-on-the-m","source":"U.Today","title":"XRP Still in Bull Market Versus Bitcoin, and XRP/BTC Chart Puts 51% Upside on the Menu","translatedTitle":"XRP ยังอยู่ในตลาดเพชรฟองต่อบิทคอยน์ และแผนภูมิ XRP/BTC มีศักยภาพเพิ่มขึ้น 51%"},{"_id":"6986d04238f2116917d89c1a","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:22:24.000Z","slug":"infinite-possibilities-announces-upcoming-launch-of-proof-of-activity-dex-and-ip","source":"CoinJournal","title":"Infinite Possibilities announces upcoming launch of Proof-of-Activity DEX and IP Membership program","translatedTitle":"Infinite Possibility ประกาศเปิดตัว DEX แบบ Proof-of-Activity และโปรแกรม IP Membership ในอนาคต"},{"_id":"6986c35e38f2116917d806f7","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T04:05:04.000Z","slug":"xrp-price-jumps-nearly-20-as-whales-buy-aggressively","source":"BeInCrypto","title":"XRP Price Jumps Nearly 20% As Whales Buy Aggressively","translatedTitle":"ราคา XRP พุ่งสูงขึ้นกว่า 20% เมื่อนักลงทุนขนาดใหญ่ซื้ออย่างรุนแรง"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
