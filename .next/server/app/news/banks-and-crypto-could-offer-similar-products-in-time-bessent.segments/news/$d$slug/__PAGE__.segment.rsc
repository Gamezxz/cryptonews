US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Congress that traditional and crypto banking products and services may be more intertwined in the future. Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, Bessent was asked by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis whether there could come a time when conventional banks and crypto are offering the same types of products. “I think that can happen over time,” Bessent said. “We’ve actually been working with small and community banks to discuss how they can be part of the digital asset revolution.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifying before Senate Banking on Thursday.

Several crypto companies reportedly offered concessions this week, suggesting giving community banks a larger role in the stablecoin system to help push the bill through the Senate.
