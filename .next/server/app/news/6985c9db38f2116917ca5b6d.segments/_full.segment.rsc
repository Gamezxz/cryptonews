f:Td75,HBAR trades within four month pattern as bullish divergence builds quietly. Breakout above $0.1042 risks triggering $6 million short liquidations. Loss of $0.0786 support would invalidate bullish breakout overwhelmingly. Hedera has remained under selling pressure after a steady decline brought HBAR back to retest a long-standing technical pattern. The token has been trading within this structure for several months, limiting upside attempts. While multiple indicators now point toward a bullish setup, price action has yet to confirm the shift, keeping sentiment cautious. HBAR Has An Underlying Bullish Trigger HBAR’s Money Flow Index is showing early signs of strength despite continued price weakness. On the two-day chart, the indicator is forming a bullish divergence with the price. While HBAR has printed a lower low, the MFI has held higher lows, indicating rising buying pressure beneath the surface. Sponsored Sponsored This divergence suggests that selling momentum is gradually fading. As sellers lose control, buyers begin to step in without immediately pushing prices higher. Such conditions often precede trend reversals, especially when supported by compression patterns and improving momentum indicators across higher timeframes. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . HBAR MFI. Source: TradingView Derivatives data highlights growing risk for bearish traders. The liquidation map shows that a breakout in HBAR price would place significant pressure on short positions. If the price reaches $0.1013, approximately $6.2 million in short liquidations could be triggered, forcing rapid position closures. Given the pattern HBAR is currently trading within, a breakout could occur quickly once resistance is breached. Forced liquidations typically accelerate price movement, amplifying upside momentum. As a result, short traders face heightened exposure if HBAR breaks above its current range. HBAR Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass HBAR Price Breakout Is Possible HBAR price is trading near $0.0826 at the time of writing, holding above the $0.0786 support level. The altcoin has been moving within a descending channel for nearly four months. This structure reflects prolonged consolidation while volatility continues to compress. A breakout from this pattern appears increasingly likely as selling pressure dissipates on a macro scale. Confirmation would require HBAR to breach the channel’s upper trendline and flip $0.1042 into support. Such a move would trigger short liquidations and push the price toward $0.129, the pattern’s projected 32% upside target. HBAR Price Analysis. Source: TradingView However, downside risk remains if broader market conditions fail to improve. A loss of the $0.0786 support would weaken the structure. Under that scenario, HBAR could slide toward $0.0622. A move to that level would invalidate the bullish thesis entirely.

The past several weeks have not been kind to the cryptocurrency markets. This trend only intensified on Thursday when the entire market bled out, with multiple double-digit price crashers. Naturally, Pi Network’s PI token was not spared, and it dumped to fresh all-time lows of under $0.135 (on CoinGecko). This meant that the asset has plunged by over 30% in the last month alone. On a broader scale, PI is down by more than 95% since its all-time high marked on February 26, 2025. Despite this massive correction, some members of the ever-vocal and optimistic Pi Network community tried to find the silver linings. This one, for example, outlined the skyrocketing PI transaction volume, which, he believes, shows “increased interest in PI despite the manipulation games done by whales.” This one was even more bullish, predicting a mind-blowing surge to $4 from the current dip in the first six months after the second Mainnet migration and once old Pioneers (Pi Network users and investors) are done selling off. More Pain to Come? If we are being realistic, it’s hard to even imagine such a rally happening soon. Not only because the overall crypto market seems to be dominated by the bears, but also due to PI’s recent price performance and the unlocking schedule for new tokens. Data from PiScan shows that almost 8 million coins will be freed in the next month on average. What’s even more worrying is the fact that this number will skyrocket to over 18 million on February 12 and to 23.6 million on February 13. Such a massive number of tokens to be unlocked might result in more immediate selling pressure from investors who have been waiting a long time for their holdings to become available for trading. This is particularly true in such a time of panic. You may also like: Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Before the FOMC Meeting, Pi Network (PI) Soars by 15%: Market Watch Pi Token Unlock Schedule. Source: PiScan The Good News On the positive side, the chart above demonstrates that the number of unlocked tokens will decline after February 20 and will normalize, which could ease the selling pressure. Additionally, there are rumors circulating online that one of the largest and oldest exchanges, Kraken, might be planning to list Pi Network’s native token, which could boost its liquidity and legitimacy among investors. 🚨 BREAKING: Kraken Exchange is preparing to integrate the Pi blockchain and list $PI for trading 👀 If confirmed, this could be a major step for Pi ecosystem adoption. ⁰Eyes on what comes next. #PiNetwork #PI #Kraken #CryptoNews #Altcoins pic.twitter.com/BAWZLcGQnH — SMC KAPIL DEV (@smckapildev) February 6, 2026 SPECIAL OFFER (Exclusive) SECRET PARTNERSHIP BONUS for CryptoPotato readers: Use this link to register and unlock $1,500 in exclusive BingX Exchange rewards (limited time offer).
