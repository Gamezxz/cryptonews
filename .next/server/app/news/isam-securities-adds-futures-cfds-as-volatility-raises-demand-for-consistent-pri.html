He also provides practical advice for retail investors on how to utilize AI tools without falling into common traps.

The second interview features Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, who recently won a debate arguing that the Prop Trading model is detrimental to the industry. Callan critiques the current model for being overly dependent on fees, having loose risk management protocols, and creating confusion for retail audiences, while explaining the factors that contributed to its recent expansion.</p></div><div class="key-points"><h3>Key Points</h3><ul><li>Dor Eligula of BridgeWise highlights AI integration in investment research and growth potential in Asian markets.</li><li>Eligula emphasizes the synergy between automation and human oversight in financial analysis.</li><li>Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, argues against the Prop Trading model, criticizing its fee dependency and risk management.</li><li>Callan won a debate at FMLS:25 regarding the negative impact of Prop Trading on the industry.</li></ul></div></section><section class="article-body"><h2 class="section-label">Article</h2><div class="article-full-text"><p>Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Securities has launched CFDs on futures to meet\nwhat it describes as growing client demand for futures-style exposure with\nsimpler handling. \nThe CFDs include an auto-rolling feature that aims to remove\nthe need for clients to monitor and switch contracts at expiry while keeping\ncontinuous exposure to the underlying futures market.\nMore CFD brokers are showing interest in the futures\nspace. Recently, NinjaTrader expanded its futures offering into Europe through Payward Europe Digital Solutions, a MiFID-regulated investment firm, initially\ncovering the Netherlands and Germany.\nThe brokers are increasingly adding futures\nand options in what is seen as a response to tighter regulatory restrictions on over-the-counter\nderivatives. A survey by Acuiti for CME Group indicating that four in five\nfirms not currently offering listed products are planning or evaluating such a\nmove.\nIntegration with Existing Infrastructure\niSAM Securities says this structure offers exposure to\nfutures prices while keeping the operational model in a familiar CFD format for\nbrokers and professional traders. The futures CFDs sit alongside iSAM Securities’\ncurrent liquidity and execution services, which use in-house pricing\ntechnology.\nAccording to the company, the online trading firm positions the new instruments as an extension\nof its existing liquidity suite. Clients can access the CFDs on futures through\ntheir current accounts, so they do not need additional operational setups to\ntrade the product.\nThe firm offers CFDs through entities regulated by the\nSecurities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong and the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission in the United States, as well as a Cayman Islands Monetary\nAuthority registered entity.\nThe firm has in parallel invested in risk and\nanalytics tools, including its RADAR real-time risk dashboard and Surge\nanalytics platform, which it distributes directly and through integrations such\nas the cTrader link with Spotware. \nVolatility Highlights Demand for Consistent Pricing\niSAM Securities notes that recent weeks of elevated\nmarket volatility have highlighted the importance of consistent pricing, strong\nrisk controls and reliable trading counterparties.\nRecently, iSAM relocated to a new London headquarters\nto support the expansion of its operations and growing global demand for its\nservices. It follows its opening of a Cyprus office in Limassol last May and\nits move to a larger office in Hong Kong in June.\nThe Limassol office was established to support clients\nin Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The group also maintains offices in the\nUnited States and the Cayman Islands.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
