The crypto market is facing one of the biggest dumps in recent times, according to CoinMarketCap . Top coins by CoinMarketCap BTC/USD The rate of Bitcoin (BTC) has declined by 4.79% over the last 24 hours. Image by TradingView On the daily chart, the price of BTC has made a false breakout of yesterday's bar's low at $62,200. Even if the bar closes far from that mark, the main crypto has not accumulated enough energy for a continued upward move. You Might Also Like In this case, sideways trading in the range of $63,000-$70,000 is the most likely scenario. Bitcoin is trading at $66,305 at press time. ETH/USD The rate of ETH has fallen by 6.7% since yesterday. Image by TradingView From the technical point of view, Ethereum (ETH) is trading similarly to BTC. The rate of the main altcoin is below the psychological mark of $2,000. Until its breakout happens, traders may expect a further decline to the $1,700-$1,800 range. Ethereum is trading at $1,923 at press time. XRP/USD XRP is the exception to the rule, rising by 0.92% over the last day. Image by TradingView On the daily time frame, the rate of XRP has bounced off the nearest support at $1.2543. However, buyers might need more time to accumulate energy for further growth. In this regard, sideways trading in the zone of $1.35-$1.50 is the most likely scenario over the next few days. XRP is trading at $1.3792 at press time. ADA/USD The price of Cardano (ADA) has fallen by 3.7%. Image by TradingView Despite today's growth, the rate of ADA remains under bears' pressure. Bulls may start thinking about a possible bounceback only if the rate fixes above the nearest level at $0.2756. Until it happens, traders may expect an ongoing correction. ADA is trading at $0.2634 at press time. SHIB/USD SHIB has kept up with most of the other coins, going down by 4.49%. Image by TradingView On the daily chart, the rate of SHIB has made a false breakout of the $0.00000543 level. If the candle closes far from that mark, the bounce back may continue to the $0.00000650 area. SHIB is trading at $0.00000604 at press time.5:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"_id":"698600e7bd1d672632b58a64","guid":"https://u.today/btc-eth-xrp-ada-and-shib-price-analysis-for-february-6","slug":"btc-eth-xrp-ada-and-shib-price-analysis-for-february-6","title":"BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA and SHIB Price Analysis for February 6","link":"https://u.today/btc-eth-xrp-ada-and-shib-price-analysis-for-february-6","pubDate":"2026-02-06T14:38:00.000Z","content":"Which coins are ready for a bounce back?","author":"Denys Serhiichuk","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/100160.jpg","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","category":"bitcoin","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum","altcoins"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"การวิเคราะห์ราคา BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA และ SHIB สำหรับวันที่ 6 กุมภาพันธ์","translatedContent":"เหรียญใดบ้างที่พร้อมจะดีดตัวกลับ?","sentiment":"neutral","fullContent":"$10","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":447,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T14:55:35.975Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T14:55:35.976Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T05:35:16.333Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986cf1438f2116917d87744","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:59.000Z","slug":"bitrue-expands-xrp-infrastructure-as-10-new-rlusd-pairs-go-live","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Bitrue Expands XRP Infrastructure as 10 New RLUSD Pairs Go Live","translatedTitle":"Bitrue ขยายโครงสร้าง XRP เมื่อ 10 คู่ใหม่ของ RLUSD เปิดใช้งาน"},{"_id":"6986cde738f2116917d86b4a","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:27:34.000Z","slug":"nft-sales-plunge-20-to-583-million-as-bitcoin-price-struggles-at-70000","source":"Crypto.news","title":"NFT sales plunge 20% to $58.3 million as Bitcoin price struggles at $70,000","translatedTitle":"ยอดขาย NFT ลดลง 20% เหลือ 58.3 ล้านดอลลาร์ เมื่อราคา Bitcoin ต่ำกว่า 70,000 ดอลลาร์"},{"_id":"6986c80a38f2116917d83573","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:25.000Z","slug":"metaplanet-pushes-ahead-with-bitcoin-buying-amid-market-gloom","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Metaplanet Pushes Ahead With Bitcoin Buying Amid Market Gloom","translatedTitle":"Metaplanet ดำเนินการต่อไปด้วยการซื้อ Bitcoin ในช่วงที่ตลาดคริปโตกำลังลดลง"},{"_id":"6986c35e38f2116917d806f7","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T04:05:04.000Z","slug":"xrp-price-jumps-nearly-20-as-whales-buy-aggressively","source":"BeInCrypto","title":"XRP Price Jumps Nearly 20% As Whales Buy Aggressively","translatedTitle":"ราคา XRP พุ่งสูงขึ้นกว่า 20% เมื่อนักลงทุนขนาดใหญ่ซื้ออย่างรุนแรง"}]}],"$L11"]
