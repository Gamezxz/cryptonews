4:Tae4,Event-based trading is increasingly being packaged as broker-ready infrastructure rather than standalone platforms. Technology providers are beginning to offer tools that allow brokers and exchanges to add prediction-style contracts to existing trading environments without building the stack in-house.
Against this backdrop, fintech provider Leverate plans to unveil a new prediction market technology offering for brokers at iFX EXPO Dubai 2026. A similar move emerged at the end of 2025, when Devexperts launched a software system enabling CFD brokers and exchanges to build their own event-contract platforms.
Prediction Markets Move Toward Broker Infrastructure 
For many traditional brokers, technical complexities have limited interest in prediction markets. Building these event-based trading products requires new pricing models, risk controls, and market management tools, unlike those used for conventional CFDs or spot markets. 
Leverate’s new product is designed to address that gap by providing the core technology needed to support trading on real-world events within an existing brokerage setup.  According to the company, the solution allows brokers to offer prediction-style contracts. 
Brokers can rely on an external technology provider for pricing, execution, and platform integration. CEO and co-founder Ran Strauss said brokers have historically been cautious about expanding into new product categories because of implementation costs and operational complexity. 
“For years, brokers have told us that the technology risk around launching new products was a key obstacle,” Strauss said.
Lower Barriers, New Considerations 
The introduction of off-the-shelf prediction market technology suggests that event-based trading is moving closer to becoming a standard feature, rather than a niche product. 
By reducing technical barriers, vendors like Leverate are enabling a wider range of brokers to experiment with prediction markets. Brokers can do this without committing to large upfront investments. 
At the same time, broader adoption raises questions around risk management, client suitability, and regulatory treatment. While prediction markets are gaining visibility across multiple jurisdictions, their classification and oversight continue to vary. These changes create additional considerations for brokers evaluating whether and how to deploy such products. 
Leverate said it would demonstrate the new technology live at its booth during iFX EXPO. The company is positioning the launch as part of a wider discussion around how brokers can respond to growing interest in event-based trading. This can be done while operating within existing platforms and compliance frameworks.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Eligula discusses potential growth in Asian markets, noting how local client behavior shapes demand, and elaborates on the integration of AI in investment research. He provides real-world examples of how automation complements human judgment to prevent errors and offers advice for retail investors on avoiding common AI pitfalls. Additionally, the text covers an interview with Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, who recently won a debate arguing against the current Prop Trading model.
