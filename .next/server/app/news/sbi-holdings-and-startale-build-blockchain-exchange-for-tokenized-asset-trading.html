We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error. We close with a practical question: how retail investors can actually use AI without falling into common traps.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Group and SBI Holdings have launched a\nblockchain that provides exchange infrastructure for tokenized\nsecurities and real-world asset (RWA) trading in Asia. \nDubbed Strium, the new platform is built to support\ntrading and settlement of tokenized equities and RWA-linked instruments in both\nspot and derivatives markets. \nIt plans to operate 24/7 and focuses on\nsecurities-linked products rather than crypto-native perpetual contracts. Strium\nalso separates its exchange architecture from direct asset issuance or custody\nto stay compatible with existing financial systems.\nExchange Layer for Tokenized Securities\nThe venture builds on a partnership between Startale\nand SBI last year that targeted the growing market for tokenized assets and\nonchain capital markets. With Strium, the partners aim to position the network\nas a core exchange layer for Asia’s onchain securities market.\n“Building on the August 2025 partnership announcement,\nwhich positioned the alliance at the forefront of the $18.9 trillion tokenized\nasset market opportunity, Strium addresses a fundamental shift now\nunderway in institutional and professional markets,” Startale announced.\nYou may also like: SBI Holdings Invests in U.S. Prime Broker Clear Street, Plans Japan Joint Venture\nThe launch of the Strium brand comes alongside proofs\nof concept that test the network’s exchange architecture, settlement efficiency\nand interoperability. The PoC work focuses on performance under high-load\nconditions and connectivity with traditional financial infrastructure and other\nblockchain networks.\nThe two firms earlier collaborated to develop a fully\nregulated yen‑denominated stablecoin aimed at global settlement use. The\nproject seeks to merge traditional financial infrastructure with\nblockchain‑based payment systems.\n\nIt includes the creation of a tokenized yen\ntailored for enterprise applications and cross‑border transactions. The\ninitiative aligns with Japan’s push for digital currency frameworks.\nSBI Steps Up US Push\nSBI recently acquired a minority stake in US brokerage Clear Street through its American subsidiary, SBI Holdings USA, in a $50\nmillion deal. The investment represents less than 1% of the New\nYork-based firm, which is preparing for an initial public offering on Nasdaq.\nAlongside the capital injection, SBI and Clear Street\nagreed to pursue a partnership that will establish a joint venture in Japan.\nThe new entity will initially concentrate on asset management services, with\nplans to expand into equities trading, prime brokerage, and digital\nasset-related businesses as the collaboration evolves.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Jared Kirui at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
