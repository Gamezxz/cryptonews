10:T1c1d,Bitcoin falls below $68,000 as ETF outflows and forced deleveraging pressure prices. JPMorgan says Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted outlook now looks stronger than gold long term. Capitulation signals spike as crypto stocks slide alongside broader market stress.

Crypto News of the Day: Bitcoin Slides Below $68,000 Amid Forced Deleveraging Bitcoin fell below $70,000 on Thursday, before extending a leg down to levels below $68,000, an area last tested on October 28, 2024. The move came as intensified selling swept across crypto markets . Sponsored Sponsored Crypto Market Sell-Off. Source: CoinGecko The decline marks roughly a 45% drop from October highs, fueled by ETF outflows , fading demand, and a “forced deleveraging” phase in futures markets. “…with demand fading, ETF inflows drying up, and futures markets entering a “forced deleveraging” phase. Analysts say weak volumes and sustained selling are prompting investors to exit at a loss, despite technical indicators signaling oversold conditions,” wrote Walter Deaton. Weak volumes and sustained selling pressure have prompted many investors to exit positions at a loss, even as technical indicators signal oversold conditions. Despite the short-term turbulence, JPMorgan is increasingly bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term potential relative to gold. The bank highlighted that BTC is now trading well below its estimated production cost of $87,000 , a level historically considered a soft floor, and that its volatility relative to gold has dropped to record lows. “…large outperformance of gold vs. Bitcoin since last October, coupled with the sharp rise in gold volatility, has left Bitcoin looking even more attractive compared to gold over the long term,” MarketWatch reported, citing JPMorgan’s quantitative strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. According to the bank, this improved risk-adjusted profile suggests significant upside for investors willing to hold over a multi-year horizon. JPMORGAN: BITCOIN NOW MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN GOLD LONG TERM JPMorgan says Bitcoin’s long-term appeal versus gold has improved after gold’s strong outperformance and rising volatility.

Shares of Coinbase , Riot, Marathon, and Strategy fell between 5% and 7% premarket after the drop below $70,000, with ETF holdings also down more than 5%. CRYPTO STOCKS SLIDE AS BITCOIN BREAKS $70,000 Crypto-related stocks fell sharply premarket after Bitcoin dropped 4.3% to about $69,456, its lowest level since November 2024.

The selloff intensified after Donald… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) February 5, 2026 The crypto downturn comes amid broader macroeconomic headwinds. US January layoffs surged 205% year-over-year to 108,435, the highest January total since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Job cuts were concentrated in transportation — led by UPS — and tech, with Amazon announcing 16,000 layoffs. Healthcare also saw notable reductions. Sponsored Sponsored Meanwhile, federal job protections were overhauled, with the Trump administration finalizing reforms affecting 50,000 civil service workers. Continuing claims remain elevated at 1.84 million, highlighting ongoing economic uncertainty. Equity markets are also witnessing a similarly complex backdrop, with the BMO Capital Markets projecting the S&P 500 could reach 7,380 by the end of 2026, implying an 8% expected return. The firm favors cyclical sectors such as industrials, materials, energy, and financials, while underweighting defensive sectors. Inflation remains a principal risk, though global monetary and fiscal stimulus provide support. With all these in mind, Bitcoin and broader financial market investors face a delicate balancing act: Technical oversold conditions and low relative volatility suggest a long-term opportunity Yet, immediate pressures from leveraged positions, ETF outflows, and macro uncertainty continue to weigh on sentiment. JPMorgan’s analysis points to potential gains for patient holders, but the short-term outlook remains volatile, reflecting a market in the midst of recalibration.
