f:T415,U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated remarkable resilience despite Bitcoin's price decline of over 50% since October 2025. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the BTC held by these ETFs has only decreased by approximately 7%, from 1.362 million to 1.272 million BTC. Global BTC ETF holdings showed similar strength, dropping by just 4.8% from 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC over the same period, indicating that investors, primarily 'boomers', are holding firm despite market volatility.

Bitcoin recently fell to $60K for the first time since October 2024, though it slightly recovered to $65K at press time. While BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced a record trading volume of $10 billion alongside a 13% price drop, analysts are divided about whether the market has reached its bottom. Chris Burniske expects further downside to levels around $58K or $50K, while Bitfinex analysts suggest that without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any upward movement might only represent a lower high in a fragile market.10:Taef,กองทุน Bitcoin ETF ในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้แสดงความยืดหยุ่นอย่างน่าทึ่งแม้ในช่วงที่ราคา Bitcoin ลดลงกว่า 50% ตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2025 ตามที่ Eric Balchunas นักวิเคราะห์ ETF จาก Bloomberg ระบุ ปริมาณ Bitcoin ที่ถือโดยกองทุนเหล่านี้ลดลงเพียงประมาณ 7% เท่านั้น จาก 1.362 ล้านเหรียญเป็น 1.272 ล้านเหรียญ การถือครอง Bitcoin ETF ทั่วโลกก็แสดงความแข็งแกร่งในทำนองเดียวกัน โดยลดลงเพียง 4.8% จาก 1.50 ล้านเป็น 1.428 ล้านเหรียญ ซึ่งชี้ให้เห็นว่านักลงทุน ส่วนใหญ่เป็น "ผู้สูงอายุ" ยังคงถือหุ้นอย่างมั่นคงแม้ในช่วงที่ตลาดผันผวน

Bitcoin เพิ่งลดลงสู่ระดับ $60K เป็นครั้งแรกนับตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2024 แม้ว่าจะฟื้นตัวกลับมาเล็กน้อยสู่ระดับ $65K ในขณะที่เขียนข่าว แม้ว่ากองทุน Bitcoin ETF ของ BlackRock จะมีมูลค่าการซื้อขายสูงสุดในรอบวันที่ $10 พันล้าน พร้อมกับการลดราคา 13% นักวิเคราะห์ยังคงแบ่งความเห็นเกี่ยวกับว่าตลาดได้ผ่านจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือไม่ Chris Burniske คาดการณ์ว่าจะมีการปรับตัวลดลงต่อไปยังระดับประมาณ $58K หรือ $50K ในขณะที่นักวิเคราะห์จาก Bitfinex ชี้ให้เห็นว่าหากไม่มีความต้องการในการซื้อขายและกระแสเงินทุนจากกองทุน ETF ที่แข็งแกร่งขึ้น การเคลื่อนไหวขาขึ้นใดๆ อาจเป็นเพียงจุดสูงสุดที่ต่ำกว่าในตลาดที่อ่อนแอ11:Tb48,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively resilient despite the crypto asset’s +50% price decline. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the overall BTC held by the ETFs dropped by only about 7%. He viewed the holders, mainly boomers, as ‘diamond hands.’ “Bitcoin’s price is down 44% from October high, but the amount of BTC held by the ETFs is only down 6.6%. Boomer strong.” Source: X Before the October crash, the U.S spot BTC ETFs held a record high of 1.362 million BTC. This stash had since dropped to 1.272 million BTC by the 4th of February. Can ETFs withstand the pressure? When zoomed out to the global holdings of BTC ETFs (covering offerings in the U.S, E.U., Asia, and others), the same picture emerged. Over the same period, global BTC ETF holdings dropped by only 72,400 BTC from October’s high of 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC. That’s only a 4.8% drop in BTC holdings. Source: BOLD report Put differently, the market fears and outflows in the past few weeks have not led to a massive drop in BTC held by ETFs. However, the asset extended its price decline over the past 24 hours, tagging $60K for the first time since October 2024. Although BTC price had moved up slightly to $65K at press time, there was still uncertainty about whether it had reached its final market bottom. Source: Bloomberg That said, the latest dump saw BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) post its record daily trading volume of $10 billion and its second-worst price drop 13%. For Balchunas , this was ‘brutal,’ further raising questions about the ETF buyers’ ability to remain resilient if markets go lower. Is $60K the market bottom? Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a VC partner at Placeholder and former Ark Invest crypto lead, said the sub-$60K levels were of ‘interest’ but expected an extra downside. “Watching with interest, but not buying yet. Expect a bounce, but doubt the bloodletting is done.” Chris nailed the October market top and the ensuing drawdown. He had projected that the market could bottom near $58K or $50K (levels that aligned with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and on-chain cost basis. For their part, Bitfinex analysts appeared hopeful that the market was not in a better position to form a bottom after the price dropped below the previous cycle peak of $69K. But they also echoed Burniske’s caution, “Order books show most demand under $66k as support bids were hit or pulled. That can set up a relief bounce, but without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any move risks being just a lower high in a fragile market.” Source: Bitfinex Final Thoughts BTC held by U.S spot ETFs has dropped by only 7% despite BTC’s +50% price decline since October 2025 Despite the extended dip to $60K-$65K zone, analysts appeared cautiously optimistic for a potential BTC bottom.12:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

Bitcoin price dropped nearly 8.6%, hovering near the $65,000 level, while Ethereum and major altcoins followed with sharp intraday losses. The intensity of the move points to more than routine profit-taking. With liquidations accelerating and sentiment collapsing into extreme fear, the ongoing crypto crash creates a dilemma among investors, one that forces traders and investors to confront a familiar question: Is this a buy-the-dip moment, or is patience still required? Liquidations Data Reveals Market Still Under Stress The key trigger of today’s crypto crash lies in derivatives data. More than $2.59 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most aggressive leverage flushes of the year. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the bulk of forced closures, while altcoins experienced cascading liquidations as price levels failed in quick succession. At the same time, total open interest fell 10.1% to $95.77 billion, confirming that leverage is being removed, not repositioned. Such conditions typically reflect instability rather than balance. Markets tend to struggle to form durable bottoms while liquidation velocity remains elevated. Sentiment Hits Extreme Fear, But Capitulation Is Incomplete The Crypto market Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, placing sentiment deep into Extreme Fear, a zone that historically precedes medium-term recoveries. However, structural signals remain mixed. Bitcoin exchange balances increased by 13,800 BTC, suggesting that selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself. Coins are still moving toward exchanges rather than being locked away by long-term holders. In previous market cycles, sustainable bottoms emerged after extreme fear persisted alongside declining exchange inflows, a condition that has not yet fully materialized. Bitcoin Price at $65K: A Decision Zone, Not a Confirmed Bottom Bitcoin’s drop toward the $65,000 region is now colliding with a signal that long-term market participants rarely ignore. The monthly stochastic oscillator has slipped into extreme oversold territory, a condition that has appeared only three times over the past decade. Each prior occurrence aligned with major bear market bottoms and the start of prolonged accumulation phases. However, history also shows this signal is not a timing trigger. In previous cycles, Bitcoin did not immediately reverse higher. Instead, price often spent weeks sometimes months moving sideways or making marginal new lows as leverage flushed out and sentiment reset. That dynamic matters today. While the long-term stochastic suggests downside may be structurally limited, short-term data still reflects stress. Open interest is falling, liquidations remain elevated, and exchange balances are rising, indicating that traders are still de-risking rather than rebuilding positions. In practical terms, this creates a split narrative. For long-horizon investors, conditions are beginning to resemble early accumulation zones. For short-term traders, volatility risk remains high until liquidation pressure eases and price stabilizes above key support. The signal argues that Bitcoin may be closer to a bottom than a top, but confirmation will require patience, not prediction. Final Thoughts: Right Time to Buy or Wait? The broader crypto market is showing classic stress signals, not clear bottoming behavior. Extreme fear readings, multi-billion-dollar liquidations, and declining open interest suggest forced deleveraging is still working its way through the system. While some assets are showing relative strength and selective accumulation, this looks more like rotation and positioning not a broad-based recovery. Historically, durable market bottoms form after volatility compresses and sellers exhaust, not during peak liquidation phases. Right now, liquidity is thin and confidence remains fragile, leaving room for further downside or prolonged consolidation. This is not a clear “buy the dip” moment for the overall market. Caution and patience are still the better strategy, with selective accumulation only where strong fundamentals and on-chain support clearly justify it.

The cryptocurrency saw a single-day decline of over $10,000, wiping out significant market value and triggering widespread liquidations. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $434.1 million in net outflows on February 5, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, reflecting growing caution among institutional investors.
