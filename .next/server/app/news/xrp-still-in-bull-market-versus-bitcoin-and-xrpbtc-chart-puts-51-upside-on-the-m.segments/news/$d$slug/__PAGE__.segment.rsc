While most of the crypto market is dealing with the implications of yesterday's multibillion bloodbath, XRP holds its ground against Bitcoin in a way few noticed. Despite extreme volatility and a brutal 26% single-day drop in its USD pair this week, XRP/BTC as presented by TradingView is still trading above the key monthly mid-Bollinger Band — an important line that often separates long-term bull and bear cycles. You Might Also Like HOT Stories This hold signals that the altcoin remains in a bullish phase versus Bitcoin , with current price action showing strong recovery on both daily and weekly time frames. If the setup holds, a move to the 0.00003293 BTC level — a 51% rally — looks more probable than not. Last bull market hope for XRP Despite market-wide bloodletting and Bitcoin’s multi-leg collapse to as low as $60,000, XRP continues to flash an unlikely but nonetheless intact bullish setup on the BTC pair. The midband has historically acted as the make-or-break line between bull and bear markets. In February 2026, XRP is not only still closing above that level but is printing a green candle after a double rejection wick into the 0.000018 zone, a region that previously marked cycle bottoms in both 2019 and 2023. XRP/BTC by TradingView On the weekly chart, XRP has stabilized just above the lower Bollinger Band and bounced 11% in the last 24 hours — one of the sharpest reversals among major altcoins. Daily structure confirms a full-bodied engulfing candle reclaiming the entire last week’s breakdown. What's next for XRP against Bitcoin? From a technical perspective, the next logical upside target sits near 0.00003293 BTC — the upper Bollinger Band on the monthly chart. That puts a 51% move from current levels on the menu. Barring a monthly close below the midband, XRP/BTC remains one of the few top-10 altcoin pairs still technically in a bull market.0:{"buildId":"uzlIAM-Kl1QSfe8HswO3i","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986d16c38f2116917d8b420","guid":"https://u.today/xrp-still-in-bull-market-versus-bitcoin-and-xrpbtc-chart-puts-51-upside-on-the-menu","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Despite market-wide volatility and a significant 26% drop in XRP's USD value, the altcoin maintains a bullish position against Bitcoin.
