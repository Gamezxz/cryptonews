4:T85f,U.S.-Iran warning resurfaces ahead of nuclear talks, further pressuring bitcoin and crypto markets Traders are likely to treat geopolitical headlines as catalysts for volatility rather than clear directional signals for crypto prices. Updated Feb 6, 2026, 4:07 a.m. Published Feb 6, 2026, 3:27 a.m. A U.S. advisory urging American citizens to “leave Iran now” is circulating again online, adding another layer of headline risk to a crypto market already wobbling on high volatility and forced liquidations. 🚨BREAKING: The US Governments tells its citizen to LEAVE IRAN IMMEDIATELY. Could this be why the markets nuked today? Are we going to war? pic.twitter.com/ZmnGDSUJcf — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) February 6, 2026 STORY CONTINUES BELOW Officials have since clarified the warning itself is not new and was first issued in mid-January. Still, the timing matters. The advisory is resurfacing just as the U.S. and Iran prepare to hold nuclear talks in Oman on Friday, with President Donald Trump publicly warning Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Tehran threatening retaliation if attacked. For crypto traders, the immediate takeaway is not whether the advisory is fresh. It’s that the market is behaving like a fragile, leveraged macro trade. In this kind of environment, geopolitical headlines tend to hit bitcoin the same way they hit high-beta tech stocks, not the way they hit gold. Bitcoin has already been swinging wildly after a week of liquidation-driven selling, and the market’s sensitivity is elevated. When positioning is stretched and liquidity is thin, even ambiguous news can trigger rapid deleveraging, especially in perpetual futures. The asset has repeatedly sold off whenever geopolitical drama makes headlines, with investors preferring the perceived safety of gold or bonds against digital assets. The Iran headlines may ultimately fade, especially if the Oman talks proceed smoothly. But in a market that is still digesting heavy losses and where sentiment is already brittle, traders are likely to treat geopolitics as a volatility accelerant rather than a directional catalyst.0:{"buildId":"LsTJ-v9Ag2pTBxF9BbCUd","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69855fd838f2116917b43b3a","guid":"7cfe18b1-9072-4a0e-a2cf-7779826958bb","__v":0,"author":"Shaurya Malwa","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Traders are likely to treat geopolitical headlines as catalysts for volatility rather than clear directional signals for crypto prices.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T03:28:24.993Z","enclosure":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c4438c0ba2fdac5b5bf468c461da958ee63c7c6-2382x1340.jpg?fm=jpg&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T03:28:24.994Z","link":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/u-s-iran-warning-resurfaces-ahead-of-nuclear-talks-further-pressuring-bitcoin-and-crypto-markets","pubDate":"2026-02-06T03:27:12.000Z","sentiment":"bearish","source":"CoinDesk","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"ความตึงเครียดระหว่างสหรัฐฯ-อิห","title":"U.S.-Iran warning resurfaces ahead of nuclear talks, further pressuring bitcoin and crypto markets","translatedContent":"ไม่มีเนื้อหา","translatedTitle":"คำเตือนสหรัฐ-อิหร่านกลับมาอีกครั้งก่อนการเจรจานิวเคลียร์ กดดันตลาด Bitcoin และคริปโตเพิ่มเติม","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T17:00:33.981Z","slug":"us-iran-warning-resurfaces-ahead-of-nuclear-talks-further-pressuring-bitcoin-and","aiSummary":"The recirculation of a US advisory warning citizens to leave Iran is adding pressure to already volatile crypto markets.

Bitcoin has been swinging wildly due to liquidation-driven selling, and the market's elevated sensitivity means even ambiguous news can trigger rapid deleveraging.","aiSummaryThai":"การเตือนของสหรัฐฯ ให้พลเมืองออกจากอิหร่านที่ถูกเผยแพร่อีกครั้งกำลังสร้างแรงกดดันต่อตลาดคริปโตที่มีความผันผวนสูงอยู่แล้ว แม้ว่าคำเตือนนี้เดิมทีออกเมื่อเดือนมกราคม แต่การปรากฏอีกครั้งก่อนการเจรจานิวเคลียร์ระหว่างสหรัฐฯ-อิหร่านในโอมานกำลังสร้างความไม่แน่นอน ตลาดคริปโตที่กำลังประสบกับการบังคับขายสุทธิและความผันผวนสูงอยู่แล้ว ตอบสนองต่อข่าวทางภูมิรัฐศาสตร์ในลักษณะเดียวกับหุ้นเทคโนโลยีที่มีความเสี่ยงสูง มากกว่าที่จะเป็นสินทรัพย์ที่ปลอดภัยเช่นทองคำ บิทคอยน์กำลังเคลื่อนไหวอย่างรุนแรงเนื่องจากการขายที่เกิดจากการบังคับปิดตำแหน่ง และความไวต่อข่าวของตลาดที่สูงขึ้นหมายความว่าแม้แต่ข่าวที่ไม่ชัดเจนก็อาจทำให้เกิดการลดตำแหน่งอย่างรวดเร็ว","fullContent":"$4","keyPoints":["US-Iran tensions are resurfacing ahead of nuclear talks, adding market uncertainty","Crypto markets already experiencing high volatility and forced liquidations","Bitcoin is trading like a high-beta tech stock rather than a safe-haven asset like gold","Thin liquidity and stretched positioning make crypto markets sensitive to geopolitical news","Traders treating geopolitical headlines as volatility catalysts rather than directional signals"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":324},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69865b1038f2116917d36188","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:13:11.000Z","slug":"can-the-us-government-bail-out-bitcoin-amid-market-carnage-treasury-secretary-be","source":"ZyCrypto","title":"Can The US Government ‘Bail Out’ Bitcoin Amid Market Carnage?
