f:Td36,Secure Digital Markets (SDM) has completed a $1
million Bitcoin transaction over the Lightning Network in a pilot settlement
with cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, marking what the firms say is the largest
publicly reported Lightning payment to date. 
The transaction, executed on Jan. 28 and valued at $1
million at the time, reportedly settled nearly instantly and with minimal fees.
According to the official announcement, it was facilitated using enterprise Lightning
infrastructure from Voltage, a Bitcoin payments and infrastructure provider
focused on institutional clients. 

Lightning is often viewed as experimental. It’s time to see it in production.We successfully sent $1,000,000 over the network.Here’s what that execution looked like.Big thanks to @krakenfx & @voltage_cloud pic.twitter.com/MoeBMDeRHV

Pointing to Faster Settlement for Institutions
“We have moved past the era of questioning Bitcoin's
institutional capacity. Now, the only remaining variable is how quickly lagging
institutions will abandon legacy systems,” said Mostafa Al-Mashita, Co-Founder
and Director of Sales & Trading at SDM.
While the network has been widely used for small consumer
payments, its suitability for large institutional settlements has remained an
open question.
Traditional Bitcoin transactions can take minutes or
longer to confirm and are subject to fluctuating fees, factors that complicate
treasury operations and inter-institution settlements. 
SDM said the pilot demonstrated that Lightning could
support use cases such as internal treasury movements, large-value settlements,
and transfers between trading venues without the delays associated with
on-chain settlement.

Kraken, one of the longest-operating crypto exchanges,
has supported Lightning for retail payments for several years. The firm said
the transaction reflects growing demand from institutional clients for faster
settlement options.
Cutting Reliance on Legacy Payment Rails
The transaction relied on Voltage’s managed Lightning
infrastructure, which provides liquidity management, node uptime, and
operational guarantees designed to meet institutional requirements.

Lightning is a second-layer network built on Bitcoin
that enables faster and cheaper payments by moving transactions off the base
blockchain.
The network is getting a boost giant fintech
firms. Last year, Revolut announced a collaboration with Lightspark to enable
payments over the Bitcoin-based Lightning Network, aiming to streamline crypto
transfers for users in the UK and selected European markets.
Lightspark, founded by former PayPal executive David Marcus, positions itself as a gateway to the “Money Grid,” a decentralized network for instant global payments. Through this infrastructure, Revolut aims to upgrade its crypto services by enabling smoother Bitcoin transfers.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading.

The first segment features Dor Eligula, Co-Founder of BridgeWise, discussing the integration of AI in investment research and analytics for brokers. He highlights growth opportunities in Asian markets, the synergy between automation and human analysis, and offers advice for retail investors on using AI tools effectively.\n\nThe second segment focuses on an interview with Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, who argues against the current proprietary trading model. Following a debate on the industry's reliance on prop trading, Callan critiques the model for being overly dependent on fees, loose on risk management, and potentially misleading for retail clients.","aiSummaryThai":"ข้อความที่ให้มาเป็นรายละเอียดของการสัมภาษณ์ผู้บริหารสองรายการจากงาน FMLS:25 ส่วนแรกคือการสัมภาษณ์ Dor Eligula ผู้ร่วมก่อตั้ง BridgeWise เกี่ยวกับการนำ AI มาใช้ในการวิจัยและวิเคราะห์การลงทุนสำหรับโบรกเกอร์ เขาชี้ให้เห็นถึงโอกาสในการเติบโตในตลาดเอเชีย ความสัมพันธ์ระหว่างระบบอัตโนมัติและการวิเคราะห์ของมนุษย์ และแนะนำนักลงทุนรายย่อยเกี่ยวกับการใช้เครื่องมือ AI\n\nส่วนที่สองเน้นไปที่การสัมภาษณ์ Brendan Callan ซีอีโอของ TRADU ผู้ซึ่งโต้แย้งต่อรูปแบบการเทรดแบบ proprietary ปัจจุบัน หลังจากการโต้วาทีเรื่องการพึ่งพาอุตสาหกรรมต่อ prop trading Callan ได้วิจารณ์รูปแบบนี้ว่าพึ่งพาค่าธรรมเนียมมากเกินไป ผ่อนปรนในการจัดการความเสี่ยง และอาจทำให้กลุ่มลูกค้ารายย่อยเข้าใจผิด","fullContent":"$10","keyPoints":["BridgeWise Co-Founder Dor Eligula discusses AI's role in broker analytics and Asian market expansion","Eligula highlights the balance between automation and human judgment in financial research","TRADU CEO Brendan Callan criticizes the current prop trading model's risks and fee structures"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":3948},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986567c4007f0a6ec7f818b","slug":"joshua-lim-bitcoins-divergence-from-gold-is-causing-market-instability-retail-in","title":"Joshua Lim: Bitcoin’s divergence from gold is causing market instability, retail interest will drive price movements, and quantum computing poses risks for institutional investors | Unchained","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:58:38.000Z","source":"Crypto Briefing","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Joshua Lim: การแตกต่างของ Bitcoin จากทองคำก่อให้เกิดความไม่มั่นคงของตลาด ความสนใจจากนักลงทุนรายย่อยจะขับเคลื่อนการเคลื่อนไหวของราคา และ quantum computing มีความเสี่ยงสำหรับนักลงทุนสถาบัน | Unchained"},{"_id":"698654284007f0a6ec7f76e9","slug":"bitcoin-bounce-steadies-crypto-markets-after-sharp-sell-off","title":"Bitcoin bounce steadies crypto markets after sharp sell-off","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:48:10.000Z","source":"AMBCrypto","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"การดีดตัวกลับขึ้นของ Bitcoin ช่วยทำให้ตลาดคริปโตมั่นคงขึ้นหลังจากการขายทิ้งอย่างรุนแรง"},{"_id":"698650a74007f0a6ec7f68b7","slug":"bitcoin-slips-deeper-into-bear-territory-cryptoquant-analysis-shows","title":"Bitcoin Slips Deeper Into Bear Territory, Cryptoquant Analysis Shows","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:30:37.000Z","source":"Bitcoin.com","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin ถอยลงลึกเข้าสู่ Bear Territory ตามการวิเคราะห์ของ Cryptoquant"},{"_id":"6986567d4007f0a6ec7f8259","slug":"bitcoin-btc-fidelity-identifies-65k-as-attractive-entry-point","title":"Bitcoin (BTC): Fidelity Identifies $65K as 'Attractive Entry Point'","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:25:38.000Z","source":"U.Today","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin (BTC): Fidelity ระบุระดับ $65K เป็น 'จุดเข้าซื้อที่น่าสนใจ'"}]}],"$L11"]
