XRP plunged over 17% on Thursday, its steepest one-day loss since October 2025, according to CoinGecko data . The drop sent the token below $1.25, extending weekly losses to nearly 30% and pushing its market cap down to $75 billion, a sharp fall from its $210 billion peak in July 2025. XRP is now down 45% from its January 2026 high of $2.41, as the broader crypto market endures one of its worst stretches in months. Bitcoin dropped 9% toward $65K, Ethereum fell below $2K, and Solana traded near $82, as the selloff widened across major tokens. Despite the sharp decline, XRP ETFs have remained resilient. Since launching in November 2025, XRP exchange-traded products have posted inflows on all but four trading days. This week alone, inflows have totaled nearly $24 million, bringing cumulative net inflows to $1.2 billion, according to SoSoValue data .","scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":167},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69865c3938f2116917d36d35","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:20:34.000Z","slug":"xrp-rebounds-as-whale-accumulation-and-network-activity-signal-price-reversal","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"XRP Rebounds as Whale Accumulation and Network Activity Signal Price Reversal","translatedTitle":""},{"_id":"69865b1038f2116917d36188","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:13:11.000Z","slug":"can-the-us-government-bail-out-bitcoin-amid-market-carnage-treasury-secretary-be","source":"ZyCrypto","title":"Can The US Government ‘Bail Out’ Bitcoin Amid Market Carnage?
