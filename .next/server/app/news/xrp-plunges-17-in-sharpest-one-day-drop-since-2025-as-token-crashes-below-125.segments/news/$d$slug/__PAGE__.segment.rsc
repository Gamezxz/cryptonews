XRP plunged over 17% on Thursday, its steepest one-day loss since October 2025, according to CoinGecko data . The drop sent the token below $1.25, extending weekly losses to nearly 30% and pushing its market cap down to $75 billion, a sharp fall from its $210 billion peak in July 2025. XRP is now down 45% from its January 2026 high of $2.41, as the broader crypto market endures one of its worst stretches in months. Bitcoin dropped 9% toward $65K, Ethereum fell below $2K, and Solana traded near $82, as the selloff widened across major tokens. Despite the sharp decline, XRP ETFs have remained resilient. Since launching in November 2025, XRP exchange-traded products have posted inflows on all but four trading days. This week alone, inflows have totaled nearly $24 million, bringing cumulative net inflows to $1.2 billion, according to SoSoValue data .","scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":167},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"698688c338f2116917d5a6c6","category":"regulation","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:30:51.000Z","slug":"bessent-warns-about-chinese-gold-backed-digital-currency-led-financial-system","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Bessent Warns About Chinese Gold-Backed Digital Currency-Led Financial System","translatedTitle":"เบสเซนต์เตือนเกี่ยวกับระบบการเงินที่นำโดยสกุลเงินดิจิทัลที่มีทองคำสนับสนุนจากจีน"},{"_id":"698689ef38f2116917d5b388","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:28:01.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-selloff-sparks-hedge-fund-speculation-around-blackrock-etf","source":"The Defiant","title":"Bitcoin Selloff Sparks Hedge Fund Speculation Around BlackRock ETF","translatedTitle":"การขาย Bitcoin ทำให้เกิดการคาดเดาเกี่ยวกกองทุนเฮดจ์ฟันด์ของ BlackRock ETF"},{"_id":"6986841238f2116917d57493","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:01:00.000Z","slug":"crypto-market-review-500000000-in-xrp-buying-volume-shiba-inu-shib-surprisingly-","source":"U.Today","title":"Crypto Market Review: $500,000,000 in XRP Buying Volume, Shiba Inu (SHIB) Surprisingly Bullish, Will Bitcoin (BTC) Be Saved Before $50,000?","translatedTitle":"รีวิวตลาดคริปโต: ปริมาณการซื้อ XRP ครั้งใหญ่ 500 ล้านดอลลาร์, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ทำกำไรได้น่าตื่นเต้น, Bitcoin (BTC) จะหลบหลีกจากการตกลงถึง 50,000 หรือไม่?"},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c32","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:00:01.000Z","slug":"hardware-wallets-and-secure-elements-what-are-you-really-trusting","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Hardware Wallets And Secure Elements: What Are You Really Trusting?","translatedTitle":"วอลเล็ตฮาร์ดแวร์และ Secure Elements: คุณสามารถวางใจได้อย่างแท้จริง?"}]}],"$L4"],["$L5"],"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
