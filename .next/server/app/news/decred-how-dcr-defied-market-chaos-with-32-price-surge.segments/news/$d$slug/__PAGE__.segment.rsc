4:Tf66,Journalist Posted: February 7, 2026 Decred [DCR] has rallied 32.44% in the past 24 hours and was up 37% over the past week, at press time. The wider crypto market turmoil has barely affected DCR, which retained its long-term uptrend. Bitcoin [BTC] has shed 4.69% in the past 24 hours adn 19.95% in the past week. In a post on X , the hybrid consensus crypto asserted that it builds on Bitcoin’s blockchain model by bringing on-chain governance and privacy, among other aspects. This privacy narrative likely drove the November rally, as ZCash [ZEC] approached $750. Back then, AMBCrypto pointed out that overheated spot markets could see a DCR pullback . Decred remains long-term bullish Source: DCR/USDT on TradingView Decred saw a steep pullback after its nearly vertical rally in the first week of November. At that time, DCR had rallied from $20.23 to $68.44 in just 16 hours. This was an incredible 238% move that was wiped out entirely in a month. Yet, as the 3-day chart showed, the $40 resistance zone had been overcome, if only briefly. This signaled bullish strength. Additionally, no major swing lows have been broken on the D3 chart. The altcoin has set a series of higher lows throughout 2025 and continued the trend into 2026. The OBV made higher highs to reinforce the strength of the buying. The CMF, another volume indicator with a slightly more nuanced calculation, showed that capital inflows were not consistent during the rallies. Sustained demand instead of a few high-volume sessions to prop up the uptrend would be more welcome. Lower timeframes show DCR opportunity Source: DCR/USDT on TradingView From the 21st of January to the 6th of February, DCR was trading within a range (purple) that stretched from $17 to $21.36. Recent hours of trading saw a decisive, high-volume bullish breakout. This breakout, especially at a time of BTC weakness, will attract investors’ attention. A retest of the $21 range highs could offer a buying opportunity targeting $26 and $27.8, the local highs made in January. Why traders should wait and watch It is highly tempting to buy the relative bullish strength of Decred right away. Yet, the range breakout gave a short-term pullback target. A retest of $21 can be monitored for a bullish reaction before buying. Final Thoughts The Decred higher timeframe trend has been bullish, evident from the series of higher lows it set throughout the past year. The lower timeframe range breakout could see a pullback toward $21 before a bullish continuation toward $27.8.

This performance stands in stark contrast to Bitcoin (BTC), which has dropped 4.69% in the past 24 hours and 19.95% in the past week. DCR's hybrid consensus model, which builds on Bitcoin's blockchain while adding features like on-chain governance and privacy, appears to be driving its market performance. Despite a previous significant rally from $20.23 to $68.44 in November 2025 that was subsequently wiped out, technical indicators suggest bullish strength with higher lows maintained throughout 2025 and into 2026.
