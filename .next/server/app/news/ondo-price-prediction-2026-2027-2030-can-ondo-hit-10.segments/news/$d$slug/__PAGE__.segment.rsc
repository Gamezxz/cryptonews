Moreover, Ondo Finance is known to be a leading RWA provider on the Solana chain and it is witnessing growing institutional interest, ONDO has solidified itself as a major player in the Real World Asset (RWA) space. With such attraction, the ONDO price prediction 2026 is what analysts and retail investors are intrigued about. But how far can it go from here? Let’s dive into the detailed ONDO price forecast from 2025 to 2030. Ondo Price Today Cryptocurrency Ondo Token ONDO Price $0.2591 11.11% Market Cap $ 1,261,834,661.46 24h Volume $ 125,026,349.7744 Circulating Supply 4,869,330,647.00 Total Supply 10,000,000,000.00 All-Time High $ 2.1413 on 16 December 2024 All-Time Low $ 0.0835 on 18 January 2024 Coinpedia’s ONDO Price Prediction 2026 ONDO/USD has been declining since early 2025, reaching a support level around $0.20 in February 2026. A potential reversal may occur if it breaks the $0.60 resistance. Key targets for Q1 2026 are $0.80 and $1.20. On the daily chart, the ONDO price fall continued in January and February, and also began on a bearish note. It is now retesting the lower border of the falling wedge pattern. This support is the level where buying could be happening, and once it overflows with demand, a rise could burst its way out. Also, the falling wedge range is narrowing, and ONDO/USD is at a key support level. February could see a revisit to the $0.50-$0.60 range. If it breaks above this level, it may aim for $0.80, which could be a significant target for February. However, if it fails to do so, the price may continue to consolidate around the support level or potentially decline further. ONDO Price Prediction 2026 The weekly chart for ONDO/USD shows a declining trend since the start of 2025, following a high of $2.14. The descending trendline acted as a strong hurdle, characterized by lower highs and lower lows in price action, indicating reduced price volatility. The persistent bearish pressure on the weekly chart signals bear dominance. The same price fall continued in Q1 2026, and January and early February have taken a severe hit, but it has reached February 2024 based support around $0.20 in early February 2026, which indicates that a reversal may be possible before Q1 completes in March 2026. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2026, the market may be ready for a rally, especially if it breaks through the $0.60 resistance. The recent establishment of $0.20 as a support level, along with increased demand for ONDO, suggests that buyers may be willing to re-enter the market at this price. If the market surpasses the $0.60 resistance following $0.50, the next big targets for ONDO/USD would be $ 0.80 and $1.20 for Q1 2026. ONDO Price Analysis: Onchain Outlook The on-chain data indicate that although the price is currently capped and has been consolidating for several months, the on-chain metrics have strengthened significantly despite the weak ONDO price action.

By December 2025, the project had surpassed 1.3 million transactions, making it the second-largest project for real-world asset (RWA) issuance after BitGo. Additionally, the “Spot Average Order Size” maintains high levels (represented by green dots) while the price is declining; it is a classic signal of Whale Absorption. Therefore, this Consistent whale activity confirms institutional conviction in the RWA (Real World Asset) sector.
