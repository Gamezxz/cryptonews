f:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

The cryptocurrency saw a single-day decline of over $10,000, wiping out significant market value and triggering widespread liquidations. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $434.1 million in net outflows on February 5, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, reflecting growing caution among institutional investors.

Robert Kiyosaki, a financial guru and the author of the well-known bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad, has posted a new tweet, engaging his followers in a dialogue about Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, rather than seeing a positive reaction, Kiyosaki faced severe criticism from the crypto community. Kiyosaki waits for new Bitcoin bottom to buy more In his tweet, Robert Kiyosaki mentioned four major assets that have been in the news a lot recently – gold, silver, Bitcoin, and the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. Kiyosaki claimed that he has not been buying any of the first three assets recently, stating that he had stopped accumulating gold at $300, silver at $60, and Bitcoin at $6,000. HOT Stories He reminded the community that recently he has had to sell some of his Bitcoin and gold, adding that he hates doing it. The reason is: “I hate paying capital gain taxes.” Although in an earlier tweet, Kiyosaki mentioned that he had done that to buy a new house. Now, Kiyosaki stated, he is waiting for new bottoms where prices would make it acceptable for him to start buying gold and Bitcoin again. He said that he would spread the word on X when he began buying gold and digital gold again. “I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold and Bitcoin, then I may buy again.” AS I POSTED on X earlier. I stopped buying silver at $60. I stopped buying Bitcoin at $6000. I stopped buying gold at $300. I have sold some Bitcoin and some gold. I hate selling because I hate paying capital gain taxes. Today…. I wait patiently for new bottoms for gold… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 6, 2026 As for Ethereum, he revealed that he has enough of it for now but he plans to acquire more. You Might Also Like X crypto community bashes Kiyosaki However, the crypto community did not take this message positively this time. First of all, the Community Notes, a local fact-checking service powered by X users, accused Kiyosaki of lying. The Community Notes stated that Kiyosaki recently tweeted, saying he was buying Bitcoin – he published that tweet on January 23 this year . That was the tweet when he stated that he does not care about the price of Bitcoin or gold going up or down: “I just keep buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum and get richer.” Back then, BTC was trading at roughly $90,000 per coin. You're such a lying grifter holy cow. You've been pumping all 3 of these non stop daily for years and now you claim you were never buying? How you didn't win the financial charlatan of the year award, I'll never understand pic.twitter.com/gv6D9mNLM4 — Mark McGrath (@MarkMcGrathCFP) February 6, 2026 Several commentators also reacted in a similar way, saying that Kiyosaki should stop deceiving people or that there is no way to verify that Kiyosaki’s claims of buying BTC, silver, and gold at low prices, even though they sound quite impressive.12:Td4f,MYX price rallies 32% despite Bitcoin crashing near $65,000 levels. Strong spot inflows contrast with negative funding rates signaling trader caution. Holding $5.99 support keeps upside toward $7.49 resistance intact. MYX Finance has defied broader market weakness with a sharp rally, gaining strong upside momentum over the past week. The surge reflects sustained investor confidence despite Bitcoin’s drop toward $65,000. While demand remains firm, emerging resistance levels suggest MYX’s upside may face near-term constraints if momentum weakens. MYX Investors’ Inflows Counter Market Sell-Off Market indicators show MYX is benefiting from steady capital inflows. The Chaikin Money Flow, which tracks buying and selling pressure, has crossed above the zero line. This shift places MYX in the positive zone , a signal commonly associated with accumulation and strengthening investor participation. Sponsored Sponsored Positive CMF readings often support price recoveries during volatile periods. In MYX’s case, rising inflows suggest buyers are absorbing supply efficiently. This behavior reinforces bullish sentiment and supports price stability, even as broader crypto markets struggle to regain footing. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . MYX CMF. Source: TradingView Despite strong spot demand, derivatives data signals caution. MYX’s funding rate has dropped sharply into negative territory. This move reflects the growing dominance of short positions over longs. Futures traders appear increasingly skeptical about the sustainability of MYX’s rally . The decline in funding rates occurred as prices continued to rise. Such divergence often suggests traders are positioning for a pullback rather than chasing upside. Elevated short interest can pressure price stability, especially if bullish momentum slows or broader market conditions deteriorate further. MYX Funding Rate. Source: Coinglass MYX Price Pushes Further MYX price has climbed 32% over the past six days and trades near $6.40 at the time of writing. The token remains above the $5.99 support, which has acted as a key demand zone. MYX has outperformed the broader market, with major assets posting losses. Sustaining this momentum depends on continued investor conviction. Ongoing inflows are necessary to offset derivatives-driven skepticism. The immediate objective for MYX is reclaiming $6.87 as support. Securing that level could allow the price to advance toward the $7.49 resistance zone. MYX Price Analysis. Source: TradingView Downside risks remain if sentiment shifts. A renewed Bitcoin sell-off could weigh on MYX , even if correlation stays limited. Failure to hold current support may trigger a gradual pullback. Such a move would erase part of the recent gains and invalidate the bullish thesis and fall through $5.99 to slide to $5.27 or lower.
