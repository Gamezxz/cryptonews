4:T4c3,The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility, with Bitcoin dropping below the critical $70,000 level for the first time in history. This decline is driven by risk-off sentiment in traditional markets, massive liquidations of leveraged positions, and macroeconomic uncertainties. Technical indicators suggest that if the market fails to stabilize, Bitcoin could see further corrections into the mid-$60,000s range.

Conversely, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has demonstrated relative resilience by maintaining its position above major structural support zones. Unlike Bitcoin, SHIB had already undergone prolonged selling pressure, which reduced speculative leverage and prevented a more severe breakdown. However, analysts warn that this strength does not guarantee a recovery, as overhead resistance remains high and Bitcoin's weakness could still drag altcoins down.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test as it approaches the psychologically significant $2,000 support level. After breaking below key moving averages, ETH remains under pressure from a negative market mood. The ability of buyers to defend the $2,000 threshold will be pivotal in determining the asset's medium-term direction.5:Tb6a,ตลาด cryptocurrency กำลังเผชิญกับความผันผวนอย่างมาก โดย Bitcoin ร่วงหล่นลงต่ำกว่าระดับสำคัญ $70,000 ซึ่งเป็นครั้งแรกในประวัติศาสตร์ การดิ่งลงนี้เกิดจากความรู้สึกหลีกเลี่ยงความเสี่ยงในตลาดทั่วไป, การ liquidation ของเงินทุนเลเวอเรจจำนวนมาก และความไม่แน่นอนทางเศรษฐกิจ ตัวชี้วัดทางเทคนิคบ่งชี้ว่าหากตลาดไม่สามารถฟื้นตัวได้ Bitcoin อาจปรับตัวลงไปที่ระดับกลาง $60,000s ได้

ในทางกลับกัน Shiba Inu (SHIB) แสดงให้เห็นถึงความแข็งแกร่งระดับหนึ่งโดยยังคงรักษาระดับราคาไว้เหนือโซนสนับสนุนโครงสร้างหลักได้ ซึ่งต่างจาก Bitcoin ที่ SHIB ได้ผ่านแรงขายมาอย่างยาวนาน ส่งผลให้ส่วนเบี่ยงเบนมูลค่าจากการเก็งกำไรลดลงและป้องกันการดิ่งลงที่รุนแรง อย่างไรก็ตาม มีคำเตือนว่าความแข็งแกร่งนี้ไม่ได้หมายถึงการฟื้นตัว เนื่องจากยังมีแนวต้านเหนือหัวสูงและความอ่อนแอของ Bitcoin อาจลาก altcoins ลงมาได้

The crypto industry has been severely impacted by recent market volatility, with Bitcoin experiencing a precipitous drop that sent the asset below significant historical levels that had held steady since its last significant breakout. As Bitcoin slipped through areas that many traders thought would provide long-term structural support to the so-called digital gold, the decline rocked market confidence. Shiba Inu avoids it On the other hand, Shiba Inu has shown a fair amount of resilience over the same time frame. While SHIB continues to trade within a broader downtrend, its price action has not mirrored Bitcoin’s collapse into historically critical territory. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView Rather than experiencing the kind of breakdown that drove Bitcoin below levels not broken since its previous bull cycle expansion, SHIB has been able to maintain its position above its most important structural support zones. HOT Stories Comparing the behavior of structural charts with percentage drawdowns makes this relative strength more evident. Although significant, SHIB's decline stayed within previously defined market ranges, while Bitcoin's decline erased months of consolidation gains and led to significant liquidation events. In other words, rather than going into a new stage of historical breakdown, SHIB stayed within anticipated corrective boundaries. A portion of this resilience stems from the fact that SHIB had previously been subjected to prolonged selling pressure, which had essentially compressed a large portion of the speculative premium prior to the most recent market-wide correction. Consequently, there was less excess leverage and speculative positioning to unwind than with Bitcoin, which had experienced a more vigorous rally before the decline. Investors should not, however, confuse relative strength with a proven recovery. SHIB continues to encounter strong overhead resistance, and the mood of the market as a whole is still shaky. Short-term pressure on altcoins, including SHIB, could still result from any new weakness in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's historic plunge The decline in Bitcoin is being caused by a number of fundamental factors. First, there is a significant decline in the appetite for macro risk, as evidenced by the sell-off of tech and equity stocks, along with digital assets. Risk-off sentiment in stocks has resulted in pressure on Bitcoin and other significant tokens, renouncing the crypto market's separation from traditional financial markets. Secondly, the sell-off has been made worse by leveraged positions and cryptocurrency liquidations. Numerous long positions were compelled to liquidate as the price broke crucial support levels, causing cascades that accelerated the momentum of the decline. According to derivatives data, there have been billions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency liquidations in the past week, further undermining market confidence. You Might Also Like Third, speculation has been impacted by expectations of monetary tightening and macroeconomic policy uncertainty. When investors reevaluate risk exposure in the face of tightening liquidity conditions, the U.S. dollar's strength and the nomination of a hawkish Federal Reserve chair have diminished the allure of high-beta assets like Bitcoin. The technical state is also important. Now that the price has moved into a weaker support zone with little historical buy interest, Bitcoin may be tested further at lower levels if the current ranges do not hold. Going forward, it will be critical if Bitcoin can recover $70,000 and stay above it. Deeper corrections, perhaps in the mid-$60,000s or lower, could occur if this market fails to stabilize, particularly if macro headwinds and capital flight from risky assets continue. Ethereum under pressure As the asset quickly approaches the structurally and psychologically significant $2,000 support zone, Ethereum is currently experiencing one of its most crucial technical moments in recent months. ETH has broken below several support levels and important moving averages following weeks of persistent selling pressure, indicating that bears are still in control of the market. You Might Also Like Price action clearly demonstrates that the downward trend that started when Ethereum was unable to sustain its strength above the $3,000 region earlier in the cycle has continued. There has been a series of lower highs and lower lows as a result of renewed selling following each recovery attempt. The recent collapse below intermediate support zones sped up the decline, bringing ETH perilously near levels that could dictate the direction of the market in the medium term. Whether $2,000 can serve as a defensive line for buyers is currently the key question. This level that served as a pivot point during earlier market phases has both psychological significance and historical significance. Given that daily momentum indicators are approaching oversold territory, Ethereum may experience at least a brief stabilization or relief bounce if buyers are able to intervene forcefully. However, there is still a high risk. The overall mood of the cryptocurrency market is still negative; altcoins are still under pressure from Bitcoin's decline, and capital flows continue to favor risk reduction over accumulation. In the absence of a significant surge in demand or a more extensive market recovery, ETH might find it difficult to stay afloat. Deeper support levels in the mid-$1,800s or even lower zones could be reached if there is a clear breakdown below $2,000, which would probably lead to additional liquidations. However, if Ethereum is able to hold this level and recover resistance regions above $2,400-$2,500, market confidence may eventually rebound.0:{"buildId":"VbtJ04e6es7f97_RG9JDv","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853abd38f2116917acb6a8","guid":"https://u.today/crypto-market-review-shiba-inu-shib-is-not-going-to-0-bitcoin-loses-70000-first-time-in-history","__v":0,"author":"Arman Shirinyan","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"The market is being pushed toward even lower levels than we have witnessed before; unfortunately, it might fall through.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:05.138Z","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/100118.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:05.143Z","link":"https://u.today/crypto-market-review-shiba-inu-shib-is-not-going-to-0-bitcoin-loses-70000-first-time-in-history","pubDate":"2026-02-06T00:01:00.000Z","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"ตลาดคริปโตซึมลง บ","title":"Crypto Market Review: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Is Not Going to $0, Bitcoin Loses $70,000 First Time in History, Will Ethereum (ETH) Save $2,000?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T13:25:49.788Z","sentiment":"bearish","translatedContent":"ตลาดกำลังถูกผลักดันไปยังระดับที่ต่ำกว่าที่เคยเห็นมาก่อน; น่าเสียดายที่มันอาจจะลดลงต่อได้","translatedTitle":"รีวิวตลาดคริปโต: Shiba Inu (SHIB) จะไม่ไปถึง $0, Bitcoin ลดสูญ $70,000 เป็นครั้งแรกในประวัติศาสตร์, Ethereum (ETH) จะช่วยรักษา $2,000 ไว้ได้หรือไม่?","slug":"crypto-market-review-shiba-inu-shib-is-not-going-to-0-bitcoin-loses-70000-first-","aiSummary":"$4","aiSummaryThai":"$5","fullContent":"$6","keyPoints":["Bitcoin fell below $70,000 for the first time due to risk-off sentiment and liquidations, risking a drop to the mid-$60,000s.","Shiba Inu (SHIB) showed resilience by holding support, as prior selling pressure had reduced speculative leverage.","Ethereum is testing the critical $2,000 support level amid continued selling pressure and negative market sentiment."],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":948},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6985ebdd51f3090f7cf87e1c","slug":"ethereum-price-prediction-is-1500-next-for-eth-after-the-aggressive-deleveraging","title":"Ethereum Price Prediction: Is $1,500 Next for ETH After the ‘Aggressive Deleveraging’?","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:24:24.000Z","source":"CryptoPotato","category":"ethereum","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคา Ethereum: ระดับ $1,500 จะเป็นเป้าหมายถัดไปของ ETH หรือไม่หลังจาก 'Aggressive Deleveraging'?"},{"_id":"6985ebda51f3090f7cf87ca6","slug":"trend-research-dumps-over-400k-eth-as-liquidation-risk-rises","title":"Trend Research dumps over 400K ETH as liquidation risk rises","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:17:01.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","category":"ethereum","translatedTitle":"Trend Research ทิ้ง ETH กว่า 400K เหรียญ เมื่อความเสี่ยงการถูกบังคับปิดสถานะเพิ่มสูงขึ้น"},{"_id":"6985e84b51f3090f7cf87186","slug":"bitcoin-crashes-10-on-bithumb-after-staff-mistakenly-airdrop-2000-btc-to-users","title":"Bitcoin crashes 10% on Bithumb after staff mistakenly airdrop 2,000 BTC to users","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:06:23.000Z","source":"Crypto Briefing","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin ร่วง 10% บน Bithumb หลังพนักงาน airdrop BTC 2,000 เหรียญให้ผู้ใช้โดยความผิดพลาด"},{"_id":"6985e84a51f3090f7cf8706c","slug":"bitcoin-price-rebounds-11-to-65k-who-is-buying-the-dip","title":"Bitcoin price rebounds 11% to $65K: Who is buying the dip?","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:06:04.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"ราคา Bitcoin ดีดตัวกลับขึ้น 11% ถึง $65K: ใครกำลังซื้อตอนราคาตก?"}]}],"$L7"],["$L8"],"$L9"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
