4:T1288,Crypto markets saw $2.65 billion liquidations, highlighting structural weakness and leverage excesses. Analysts cite weak liquidity, negative sentiment, and cascading liquidations reinforcing bearish cycles. Rising capitulation and deleveraging may signal emerging long-term Bitcoin buying opportunities ahead. Trader losses intensified during the first week of February. Liquidation volume kept rising as the market repeatedly crushed recovery expectations, driven by consecutive red candles.

The account emphasized that this is a recurring cycle: liquidations damage sentiment, and worsening sentiment triggers further liquidations. Bitcoin’s intraday price swings of up to $10,000 were attributed to sharply reduced market depth. The current Bitcoin market depth is only 30% of its October peak.
