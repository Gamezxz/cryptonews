We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

Group\nhas integrated MetaQuotes' Ultency Matching Engine into its trading\ninfrastructure, giving institutional clients faster execution and tighter\nconnectivity across its MetaTrader 5 offering.\nThe\nLondon-based cross-asset exchange handles over $40 billion in daily spot FX and\ndigital asset flow. Brokers accessing that liquidity through MT5 will now route\norders through Ultency, MetaQuotes' low-latency aggregation and matching\nsystem.\nLMAX also\nexpanded its digital asset derivatives in recent months, and the Ultency\nintegration arrives as the firm adds 19 new tokens to its perpetual futures\nlineup. The exchange initially launched 100x\nleverage crypto perpetuals in September targeting institutional demand for leveraged digital\nasset exposure.\n“Integrating\nMetaQuotes' Ultency Matching Engine enhances the existing seamless\nfunctionality our broker and institutional clients expect across our trading\nvenues,” said Jenna Wright, Managing Director of Digital Assets at LMAX\nGroup.\n[#highlighted-links#] \n“It\nstrengthens execution quality, improves performance and enables clients to\ntrade effortlessly across the full suite of LMAX products, including our\nexpanding range of perpetual futures, offering a substantial market opportunity\nfor institutions,” she explained.\nExecution Speed Becomes\nCompetitive Factor\nUltency\nfunctions as a built-in matching engine within MetaTrader 5, eliminating the\nneed for brokers to maintain separate liquidity bridges. MetaQuotes\nintroduced Ultency at\nFMLS:25, positioning it as an alternative to third-party bridge providers that\nhave historically connected MT5 brokers to external liquidity sources.\nOrder\nprocessing speed matters for firms trading perpetual futures, where funding\nrates reset every eight hours and price movements can trigger rapid position\nadjustments. LMAX clients trading through MT5 will route executions through\nUltency's aggregation layer rather than external middleware.\n“Their\nreputation for delivering transparent, high‑performance liquidity aligns\nperfectly with our commitment to advancing institutional‑grade trading\ntechnology,” Renat Fatkhullin, CEO of MetaQuotes, added. “This\nintegration enables MT5 participants to access faster execution, deeper\nliquidity and greater operational resilience.”\nPerpetual Futures Offering\nExpands\nLMAX also\nhas added Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, Solana, TRON, Dogecoin, Cardano,\nUniswap, Chainlink, Aave, Aptos, BNB, Toncoin, Sui, Avalanche, Polkadot,\nInternet Computer, Hedera, and Near to its perpetual futures contracts. The\nexchange started with Bitcoin and Ethereum pairs when it entered the perpetuals\nmarket last September.\nGMG Prime\nadopted Ultency in\nJanuary to connect institutional liquidity to MT5, becoming one of the first\nliquidity providers to implement MetaQuotes' matching technology. LMAX follows\na similar path, though it operates regulated execution venues rather than\nserving purely as a liquidity provider.\nThe firm's\ninfrastructure includes FCA and CySEC-regulated brokers, an FCA-regulated\nmultilateral trading facility, and a Gibraltar-licensed digital asset venue.\nLMAX secured 150\nmillion dollars from Ripple in January to support RLUSD stablecoin trading and cross-asset CFD\nproducts.\nLMAX\noperates matching centers in London, New York, Tokyo, and Singapore, serving\nfunds, banks, and brokerages in more than 100 countries.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading.
