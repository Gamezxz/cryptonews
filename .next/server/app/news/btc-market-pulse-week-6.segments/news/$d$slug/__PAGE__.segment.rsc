4:Td46,Bitcoin has fallen to $74K after losing the November lows, with momentum collapsing as 14D RSI plunges into oversold territory. Spot volume has rebounded, but looks reactive, reflecting churn during downside continuation rather than confident dip buying. Overview Bitcoin has fallen to $74K after failing to hold the November lows, with momentum collapsing as the 14-day RSI plunges into deeply oversold territory. Spot volume has rebounded, but the rise looks more reactive than constructive, reflecting churn during downside continuation rather than confident dip buying. Spot conditions remain weak, with Spot CVD breaking to new lows and confirming sustained sell-side dominance. While ETF net outflows have eased slightly, overall positioning still points to ongoing distribution pressure, even as trade volume spikes suggest active risk rotation rather than decisive buying. Derivatives markets continue to lean defensive. Futures open interest has eased, signalling a modest reduction in leverage, while funding rates have cooled as long appetite fades. Perpetual CVD has deteriorated further, highlighting aggressive sell pressure from leveraged traders and reinforcing downside conviction. Options markets are de-risking. Open interest has contracted below its lower band, reflecting position closures and reduced engagement, while the volatility spread has compressed, indicating a fading fear premium. 25-delta skew has softened marginally, suggesting hedging demand remains elevated but no longer accelerating On-chain activity remains subdued. Active addresses and fee volumes have improved modestly, however transfer volume remains low and realised cap continues to contract, signalling weak net capital inflows. Profitability has deteriorated further, with supply in profit falling and unrealised losses deepening, while realised losses continue to dominate, consistent with a market under stress. Overall, conditions have shifted into a clear risk-off regime across spot, derivatives, ETFs, and on-chain indicators. With price now below key cost bases and profitability compressed, near-term stabilisation likely depends on sell pressure exhausting and demand returning to defend the $74K region.
