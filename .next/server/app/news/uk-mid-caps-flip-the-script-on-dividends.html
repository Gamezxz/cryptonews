Additionally, Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, shares his critical perspective on the proprietary trading model. Following a debate victory on the topic, Callan argues that the current prop trading structure is overly dependent on fees, lacks strict risk management, and is often too complex for retail investors.</p></div><div class="key-points"><h3>Key Points</h3><ul><li>Dor Eligula of Bridgewise highlights AI growth in Asian investment research and the need for human oversight.</li><li>Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, criticizes the prop trading model for high fees and loose risk management.</li><li>The interviews were conducted at the FMLS:25 summit, covering fintech trends and industry debates.</li></ul></div></section><section class="article-body"><h2 class="section-label">Article</h2><div class="article-full-text"><p>Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

the Cap Fits, Why Not Reap the Dividend?\nUK mid-caps have had a hard time over recent years, weighed down by negative sentiment around the domestic economy and investor preference for large-cap stocks and international equities.\nHistorically, mid-cap stocks tended to offer higher growth potential but at the expense of dividends. Now this situation has reversed and, for the first time since the early years of the 21st century, there are a large number of mid-cap companies trading on lower valuations and offering significantly higher dividend yields than large caps.\nAre you attending iFX Expo Dubai? Do not miss the first-ever Trading Festival.\nWith the UK economy showing tentative signs of growth and the government seemingly getting a handle on inflation, this segment of the market is starting to look more attractive, especially when valuations are taken into account.\nThe FTSE 250 is trading at not much more than two-thirds of its long-term average price-to-earnings ratio.\nAccording to AJ Bell, the highest-yielding stock among mid-cap companies in the UK market is Ithaca Energy at 11.4%. However, the firm’s head of markets cautions that any yield above 9% would need extra investigation by potential investors to make sure it is not a one-off payout, as companies are not normally that generous with dividends.\nThe second-highest dividend payer in the FTSE 250 is Lancashire, a speciality insurer focusing on risks in areas including property, energy, marine and aviation, which has a strong history of paying high dividends due to the nature of its business.\nOther generous dividend payers in the FTSE 250 include various investment trusts in the renewable energy and property sectors.\nGains in Spain Lead to Market Overvaluation\nThe suggestion that Europe offers equity investors better value than the US is not a new one, as discussed previously, with European stock markets starting last year significantly undervalued.\nHowever, when looking at individual countries, a more uneven pattern emerges. While the Morningstar Europe Index gained more than 19.4% in 2025, compared with 8.7% in 2024 and 15.5% in 2023, there was a large gap between Spain, which returned more than 57%, and France, where the stock market gained a more modest 13%. Italy was the other strong performer, gaining more than 37%.\n\nEuropean stocks continue to outperform the US, with the STOXX 600 up over 4% YTD versus a 1.9% gain for the S\u0026P 500 and riding a seven-month winning streak. Within Europe, France is the only country lagging behind the S\u0026P.Read today's Morning Lineup at https://t.co/StU33FFeZV pic.twitter.com/HTbYgxxmAJ\n— Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) February 3, 2026\nUnsurprisingly, the extent to which European markets are undervalued has decreased over the past 12 months. Only seven markets had a price-to-fair-value ratio below 1 at the end of 2025, and overall values were at their highest level for three years.\nSpain was the most overvalued market, followed by Italy and Belgium, where values increased even faster than in Spain last year.\nAnother factor in the narrowing gap between European and US equities was the rise in fair values for some large companies in the US index, including NVIDIA, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, which reduced the valuation of the market as a whole.\nFernando Luque, a senior financial analyst at Morningstar, noted that the financial services sector was the most expensive in valuation terms, followed by utilities, where the three largest companies in the sector ended the year with very different valuations. Spain’s Iberdrola was overvalued by 20% and Italy’s Enel by 10%, while the UK’s National Grid was undervalued by 6%.\nApart from real estate, one of the cheapest sectors was consumer cyclical. Although most European sectors saw their price-to-fair-value estimates increase during 2025, this was not the case for the technology, industrials and communication services sectors, with technology failing to see an increase despite the rise in ASML Holding.\nWhy Emerging Markets Could Build on Earnings Expectations\nAnalysis conducted by investment firm Redwheel indicates that 2025 marked the first year emerging markets outperformed the US since 2017. Long-term supporters of non-US markets hope this marks a new period of stronger performance, similar to the first decade of the millennium, when emerging markets outperformed every year except 2008.\nIn the 2000s, emerging market performance was driven by higher commodity prices and a weaker US dollar. By 2025, similar conditions were in place, supported by falling rates, attractive valuations, reform momentum and shifting capital flows.\n\nEuropean stocks continue to outperform the US, with the STOXX 600 up over 4% YTD versus a 1.9% gain for the S\u0026P 500 and riding a seven-month winning streak.

Markets outside the US began to close the valuation gap in 2025, and earnings outside the US, although more volatile, are improving and are expected to match the US growth rate through 2026.\nInterest rates are expected to be the most important economic driver of global equity performance this year, with the Federal Reserve setting the pace. The easing cycle that began in late 2024 resumed later last year and is likely to continue in 2026, with futures pricing indicating that the US will cut its policy rate twice more in 2026, reaching a level of 3–3.25% by the end of the year.\nLooser US monetary policy allows emerging market central banks to lower interest rates, which are currently very tight given how quickly inflation has fallen.\nMeanwhile, the dollar is expected to face many of the same pressures this year as in 2025, including larger US fiscal deficits and rising government debt without a clear plan for fiscal control. Markets have also shown concern about erratic US economic and trade policy, as well as the potential weakening of the independence of key institutions such as the Federal Reserve.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Paul Golden at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
