4:Td4e,Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sought to steady market sentiment during a sharp crypto sell-off, arguing that short-term price pain does not undermine the long-term case for blockchain-based financial systems. Summary Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson warned that crypto markets could face further losses, telling viewers, “It’ll get worse. It’ll get redder,” as digital assets extended a broad sell-off. Hoskinson said he has personally lost more than $3 billion during past market cycles, arguing that his commitment to blockchain development is driven by conviction rather than profit. He said Cardano is entering a commercialization phase, citing full decentralization, completed governance upgrades, and upcoming initiatives such as Hydra and privacy-focused project Midnight. Speaking during a public livestream from Tokyo, Hoskinson acknowledged worsening market conditions and warned that further volatility could lie ahead. “It’ll get worse. It’ll get redder,” he said, urging developers and investors to focus on building rather than retreating. “I’ve lost over $3 billion” Addressing criticism that crypto founders are insulated from downturns, Hoskinson said he has personally absorbed substantial financial losses over the years, estimating them at more than $3 billion. “I’ve lost more money than anyone listening to this,” he said, adding that he could have exited the industry long ago but chose to remain involved out of principle rather than financial incentive. Hoskinson emphasized that his continued participation in the sector is driven by conviction rather than profit, arguing that integrity and long-term vision matter more than short-term market cycles. Cardano ready for commercialization Hoskinson said Cardano ( ADA ) has reached a point where years of infrastructure development are beginning to translate into real-world use cases. According to him, the network is now fully decentralized, with governance mechanisms largely in place. “The infrastructure is strong. We’re ready for commercialization,” Hoskinson said. He highlighted Hydra, Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution, as well as privacy-focused initiatives such as Midnight and StarStream, positioning them as key components of the ecosystem’s next phase. These projects are aimed at improving throughput, enhancing data protection, and supporting applications beyond speculative trading. Crypto as a global economic tool The Cardano founder also broadened his remarks to include a critique of existing financial and political systems, arguing that global economic coordination is becoming increasingly difficult under traditional frameworks. “The only way to run a world like this is through a cryptocurrency,” Hoskinson said, contending that blockchains provide rule-based systems that reduce reliance on centralized authorities in a more interconnected global economy. He framed blockchain adoption as a response to structural shifts driven by artificial intelligence, demographic change, and declining trust in institutions. Looking beyond the downturn Hoskinson closed the livestream by urging the crypto community to maintain long-term focus despite ongoing volatility. He stressed that progress should not be judged solely by token prices or short-term sentiment. “I’ll be with you on the red days and the green days,” he said. “I ain’t going anywhere.”0:{"buildId":"nyNMduq-QDcIzXqHG9EwS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33829","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448609","__v":0,"aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","author":"Ann Maria Shibu","categories":["altcoins"],"category":"altcoins","content":"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sought to steady market sentiment during a sharp crypto sell-off, arguing that short-term price pain does not undermine the long-term case for blockchain-based financial systems.
