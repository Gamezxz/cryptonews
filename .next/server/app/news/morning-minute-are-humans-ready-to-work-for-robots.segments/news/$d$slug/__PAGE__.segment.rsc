4:T45a,The intersection of AI and crypto is gaining traction as a potential "killer use case," highlighted by the launch of RentAHuman.ai. This platform allows AI agents to hire humans for physical tasks, such as attending meetings or signing documents, paying them in stablecoins. The platform saw over 50,000 signups within a day, crashing its servers, while Circle's CEO Jeremy Allaire also demonstrated a similar prototype utilizing USDC for onchain treasuries and payments. This trend leverages crypto rails to solve payment issues for AI agents that lack bank accounts, potentially creating a new gig economy where humans serve as the workforce for autonomous bots.

In market news, major cryptocurrencies faced a significant selloff, with Bitcoin dropping below $70,000 and Ethereum falling 7%, pushing the Fear and Greed Index to a low of 14. Institutional developments included Fidelity launching the FIDD stablecoin on Ethereum and the CME exploring its own token. Meanwhile, regulatory pressures are mounting, as Nevada sued Coinbase over allegations that its prediction markets constitute unlicensed gambling.5:T9e3,การผสมผสานระหว่าง AI และ crypto กำลังได้รับความสนใจอย่างมากในฐานะ use case หลัก โดยเฉพาะการเปิดตัว RentAHuman.ai ซึ่งเป็นแพลตฟอร์มที่อนุญาตให้ AI agents จ้างมนุษย์ทำงานในโลกแห่งความเป็นจริง เช่น การเข้าร่วมประชุมหรือเซ็นเอกสาร และจ่ายเงินด้วย stablecoins แพลตฟอร์มนี้มีผู้สมัครกว่า 50,000 รายภายในวันเดียวจนเซิร์ฟเวอร์ล่ม ขณะที่ Jeremy Allaire CEO ของ Circle ก็ได้แสดงต้นแบบระบบที่คล้ายกันโดยใช้ USDC สำหรับ onchain treasuries และการชำระเงิน เทรนด์นี้ใช้ประโยชน์จาก crypto rails เพื่อแก้ไขปัญหาการชำระเงินให้ AI agents ที่ไม่มีบัญชีธนาคาร ซึ่งอาจสร้าง gig economy ใหม่ที่มนุษย์ทำงานเพื่อบอทอัตโนมัติ

Today’s top news: Crypto majors fall hard overnight; BTC goes sub-$70k Fear and Greed back to 14, lowest since November 2025 The CME reportedly evaluating launching its own CME token Fidelity launched its FIDD stablecoin on Ethereum yesterday Rainbow Wallet’s RNBW token airdrop goes live today 🤖 AI Agents Are Hiring Humans Now - And They’re Paying in Crypto For years, everyone’s been asking whether AI would take human jobs. Turns out it might just work the other way. 📌 What Happened A crypto developer named Alex from Uma Protocol launched RentAHuman.ai - a platform that lets AI agents outsource real-world tasks to actual people. It’s effectively a job board where bots find humans to do things software can’t: attend meetings in person, pick up packages, physically sign documents, shake hands, etc. Humans list themselves as “rentable,” set hourly rates between $50 and $175, and get paid in stablecoins when an AI agent calls them for a task. The platform uses MCP (Multi-Call Protocol) to let any AI system tap into the human labor pool with a single API call. The thing took off immediately. 130 signups in the first few hours ballooned to over 50,000 within a day. Demand was so high it crashed the servers on launch, with Alex posting that “Claude is working to bring it back online.” But Rent A Human was just the beginning. Yesterday on X Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of Circle, shared that he’d already vibe-coded his own AI Agent x Human employment app. On Circle’s Arc testnet. I vibe coded a version of this on Arc testnet. Projects w milestones, onchain treasury than escrows funds, agents and humans can take all or divide up work. Agents do review of work w humans in the loop for a ultimate milestone payment release Dispute resolution w blind… — Jeremy Allaire - jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) February 4, 2026 His prototype includes milestone-based projects, onchain treasuries that escrow funds, AI agents that review work with humans in the loop, and even dispute resolution through a blind jury of evaluators. All decentralized. All running on USDC. 🧠 Why It Matters Crypto has been searching for its next killer use case beyond trading and speculation. Powering the agentic revolution might be it. Think about why crypto rails make sense here. AI agents don’t have bank accounts. They can’t swipe credit cards. But they can hold wallets. Stablecoins make instant, borderless payments possible - a bot in San Francisco can pay a human in Manila in seconds. a16z said similar in their essay from yesterday “AI needs blockchains — especially now” Existing payment rails can't handle the volume or granularity of agent-to-agent commerce - micropayments, nanopayments, automated revenue splits. Blockchain infrastructure ( L2s , smart contracts , rollups ) can. Crypto makes sense here. And it’s effectively spawning the next iteration of the gig economy. Uber transformed mobility by turning every car owner into a potential driver. Airbnb did the same with house owners. RentAHuman.ai and what Circle is building could do the same for AI, turning every person with a crypto wallet into callable labor for autonomous agents. We’re still very early, but this could soon balloon to a significant sector of jobs. If the humans and robots can cooperate… 🌎 Macro Crypto and Markets Crypto majors are very red down 7-10% after a brutal overnight selloff; BTC -8% at $69.6K; ETH -7% at $2,070; SOL -7% at $89.4; XRP -14% at ~$1.36 MYX (+4%) and LIT (+1%) led top movers Bitcoin sank to ~$69,200 overnight Wednesday, extending its weekly losses to 20%; fear & greed at 14, the lowest since late November 2025 Treasury Secretary Bessent testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday; told Rep.
