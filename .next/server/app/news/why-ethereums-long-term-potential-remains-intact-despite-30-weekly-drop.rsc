f:Tfe4,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 On the macro side, the market’s risk-off mood has hit most risk assets, and short-term holders are usually the first to fold. So far in Q1, pretty much all the big-cap coins are feeling the pressure, with weak hands shaking out. That said, any rebound really comes down to long-term holders keeping their conviction. Take Ethereum [ETH], as an example. It’s roughly 45% off its September peak at $3,500, putting a lot of LTHs underwater. On top of that, Vitalik’s recent comments haven’t helped sentiment. His take on the “copy-paste” approach for L2s and alternative L1s has stirred some extra FUD, leaving traders unsure about ETH’s short-term direction. Source: X That reaction isn’t too surprising though. Lately, Ethereum, and blockchains in general, aren’t really defined by price moves. The real story is deeper adoption, which relies on solid infrastructure rather than “hype.” Buterin’s comments fit that narrative . He recently stressed that scaling should be the focus, instead of just pumping out more L1s, even for EVM chains. The real push should be on innovation, improving privacy, building more apps etc. In short, his vision leans towards long-term growth for blockchain and Ethereum by extension. Naturally, the question arises – Is ETH really setting the stage for the long run, with recent sell-offs just a short-term shakeout? What Ethereum’s metrics say about the road ahead Looking at Ethereum, this breakdown isn’t just profit-taking. In fact, ETH has emerged as the worst-performing asset in this downturn, dropping by about 30% just this week. Consequently, the pullback seems more like a sentiment-driven crash, fueled by forced exits and panic selling. And yet, on-chain metrics might just tell us a different story. Ethereum’s staking rate just hit a new all-time high, with roughly 30.3% of all ETH now staked. Exchange balances have continued to fall sharply too, down to only 16.2 million ETH. Source: CryptoQuant Taken together, this divergence backs AMBCrypto’s thesis. From a technical standpoint, the short-term picture is rough. Rising FUD, ETF outflows, massive deleveraging, and a plunging ETH/BTC ratio have pushed Ethereum’s market share to a multi-month low of under 11%. That said, falling exchange reserves and rising staking volumes (two key metrics of long-term conviction) suggest the market may still be bullish on Buterin’s vision , reinforcing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. In this light, ETH’s recent sell-offs look more like macro-driven volatility and broader risk-off fear, than a problem with Ethereum itself. This makes this pullback feel like a short-term shakeout, rather than a fundamental shift. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s 30–45% pullback and market volatility reflect macro-driven fear and weak-hand exits, not a loss of conviction. Rising staking rates and falling exchange balances mean that long-term holders may be staying bullish on Ethereum.
