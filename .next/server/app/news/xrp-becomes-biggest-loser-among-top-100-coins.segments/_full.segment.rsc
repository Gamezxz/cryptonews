The cryptocurrency market is currently enduring an extremely severe correction. XRP has emerged as the worst performer among the top 100 leading cryptocurrencies, collapsing by more than 20%. The Ripple-linked token is now on the verge of falling below Circle's USDC stablecoin by market capitalization. HOT Stories The controversial token is now down nearly 70% from the record peak of $3.65 that was reached last July. No safe harbor The downturn has also been particularly harsh on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Zcash (ZEC) recorded a 19.2% loss, dropping to $213.65. Sector leader Monero (XMR) fell 18.5% to trade at $310.96. The market-wide sell-off has left virtually nowhere to hide. Not a single cryptocurrency in the top 100 has managed to remain in the green during the current rout (excluding stablecoins). You Might Also Like The downturn has been universal, wiping out gains across every major sector. However, some altcoins did manage to buck the trend with relative strength. Hyperliquid (HYPE), the decentralized exchange token, showed notable resilience, dropping by less than 4%. It has been boosted by a recent Coinbase listing. TRON (TRX), Toncoin (TON), and some other major tokens have also logged less severe drops.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"69853abd38f2116917acb6b4","guid":"https://u.today/xrp-becomes-biggest-loser-among-top-100-coins","__v":0,"author":"Alex Dovbnya","categories":["altcoins"],"category":"altcoins","content":"XRP has plummeted over 20%, leading a catastrophic altcoin rout that has wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market value.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:05.833Z","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/234213412423.png","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T00:50:05.834Z","link":"https://u.today/xrp-becomes-biggest-loser-among-top-100-coins","pubDate":"2026-02-05T20:17:36.000Z","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"XRP ร่วงกว่า 20% กลายเป็นเหรียญที่ปรับตัวลงมากท","title":"XRP Becomes Biggest Loser Among Top 100 Coins ","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T21:35:14.711Z","sentiment":"bearish","translatedContent":"XRP ได้ร่วงลงมากกว่า 20% นำไปสู่การตลาด altcoin ที่ล่มสลายอย่างหนักซึ่งได้กวาดล้างมูลค่าตลาดไปเกือบ 1 ล้านล้านดอลลาร์","translatedTitle":"XRP กลายเป็นเหรียญที่ขาดทุนมากที่สุดในบรรดาเหรียญ 100 อันดับแรก","slug":"xrp-becomes-biggest-loser-among-top-100-coins","fullContent":"$f","scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":277},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69865c3938f2116917d36d35","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:20:34.000Z","slug":"xrp-rebounds-as-whale-accumulation-and-network-activity-signal-price-reversal","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"XRP Rebounds as Whale Accumulation and Network Activity Signal Price Reversal","translatedTitle":""},{"_id":"698658b738f2116917d34770","category":"defi","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:02:13.000Z","slug":"ripple-integrating-hyperliquid-into-its-prime-brokerage-platform-to-broaden-inst","source":"ZyCrypto","title":"Ripple Integrating Hyperliquid Into Its Prime Brokerage Platform To Broaden Institutional DeFi Access Fails To Bump XRP Bulls","translatedTitle":"Ripple ผนวก Hyperliquid เข้ากับแพลตฟอร์ม Prime Brokerage เพื่อขยายการเข้าถึง DeFi สำหรับสถาบัน แต่ก็ไม่สามารถกระตุ้น XRP ขึ้นได้"},{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d3380e","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:00:43.000Z","slug":"us-treasury-sec-to-wall-street-if-you-hate-crypto-rules-el-salvador-is-waiting","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"US Treasury Sec To Wall Street: If You Hate Crypto Rules, El Salvador Is Waiting","translatedTitle":"US Treasury Sec บอก Wall Street: หากคุณเกลียดกฎ Crypto, El Salvador กำลังรออยู่"},{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33810","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:00:33.000Z","slug":"a-major-xrp-ledger-win-that-most-investors-might-have-missed","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"A Major XRP Ledger Win That Most Investors Might Have Missed","translatedTitle":"ชัยชนะครั้งสำคัญของ XRP Ledger ที่นักลงทุนส่วนใหญ่อาจพลาด"}]}],"$L10"]
