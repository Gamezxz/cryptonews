4:T40c,TRON has officially overtaken Ethereum in USDT dominance, capturing 44.97% versus Ethereum's 44.56%. This shift is significant as stablecoin dominance is considered a foundational element for DeFi dominance, providing deeper liquidity for trading, lending, and borrowing. Over the past month, TRON's USDT supply increased by 3.62% to 83.49 billion, while Ethereum saw a 5.6% decrease to 82.74 billion, despite Ethereum still maintaining a much higher Total Value Locked (TVL) of $58 billion compared to TRON's $4 billion.

The article highlights how TRON is positioning itself as a potentially more resilient DeFi hub during market volatility. With 48% of TRX tokens locked (versus Ethereum's 30%), TRON demonstrates stronger staking activity that may help reduce selling pressure. The combination of high staking rates and growing USDT liquidity is creating a 'flywheel effect' that could make TRON more attractive to users seeking stability in volatile markets, suggesting we're witnessing a 'stablecoin war' between Layer 1 networks.5:Ta0f,TRON ได้แซงหน้า Ethereum ในส่วนแบ่งการครอบงำ USDT อย่างเป็นทางการ โดยครอบงำ 44.97% เมื่อเทียบกับ Ethereum ที่ 44.56% การเปลี่ยนแปลงนี้มีความสำคัญ เนื่องจากการครอบงำของ stablecoin ถือเป็นฐานสำคัญสำหรับการครอบงำ DeFi ซึ่งช่วยให้มีความสามารถในการซื้อขายที่ดีขึ้น การกู้ยืม และการให้กู้ยืม ในช่วงเดือนที่ผ่านมา อุปทาน USDT ของ TRON เพิ่มขึ้น 3.62% เป็น 83.49 พันล้าน ในขณะที่ Ethereum มีการลดลง 5.6% เป็น 82.74 พันล้าน แม้ว่า Ethereum จะยังคงมีมูลค่า Total Value Locked (TVL) สูงถึง 58 พันล้านดอลลาร์ เมื่อเทียบกับ TRON ที่ 4 พันล้านดอลลาร์

บทความชี้ให้เห็นว่า TRON กำลังวางตัวเป็นศูนย์กลาง DeFi ที่อาจทนต่อความผันผวนของตลาดได้ดีกว่า ด้วยการมี token TRX ที่ถูกล็อกไว้ถึง 48% (เมื่อเทียบกับ Ethereum ที่ 30%) TRON แสดงให้เห็นถึงกิจกรรม staking ที่แข็งแกร่งกว่า ซึ่งอาจช่วยลดแรงขาย การผสมผสานระหว่างอัตรา staking ที่สูงและความสามารถในการซื้อขาย USDT ที่เพิ่มขึ้นกำลังสร้าง 'ปรากฏการณ์ flywheel' ที่อาจทำให้ TRON ดูน่าดึงดูยิ่งขึ้นสำหรับผู้ใช้ที่ต้องการความเสถียรในตลาดที่มีความผันผวน ซึ่งบ่งชี้ว่าเรากำลังเห็น 'สงคราม stablecoin' ระหว่างเครือข่าย Layer 1 ต่างๆ6:Tea8,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 Stablecoin dominance is basically the first step to DeFi dominance. The logic is simple – Networks with more stablecoins locked on-chain have deeper liquidity, which enables smoother trading, lending, and borrowing. Notably, with Tether [USDT] alone accounting for 60% of the stablecoin market, it gives the networks that host it a relatively stronger foundation. Looking at L1s, it’s clear that they are strategizing around this advantage. According to DeFiLlama, TRON [TRX] has officially overtaken Ethereum [ETH] in USDT dominance, capturing 44.97% versus ETH’s 44.56%. This has reinforced the idea that stablecoins are becoming a critical battleground. Source: DeFiLlama Zooming out, TRON’s growing USDT share is even more obvious. Over the past month, TRX’s USDT supply jumped by 3.62%, hitting 83.49 billion. All while Ethereum saw a 5.6% drop over the same period, falling to 82.74 billion. What makes this interesting is the timing. TRON’s USDT growth is happening in a risk-off market , where major assets are correcting. Ethereum, for example, slid by 15.36% over the month to multi-month lows. By comparison, TRX has limited its losses to 2.6%, raising the question – Is TRON positioning itself as a more resilient DeFi hub, one that can weather volatility better than ETH thanks to its growing stablecoin base? TRON emerges as a DeFi rail amid the stablecoin race Liquidity is what really drives DeFi dominance. Analysts are calling it a ‘stablecoin war’ between L1s . TRON is making moves, grabbing more USDT dominance, but Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) of $58 billion still dwarfs TRON’s $4 billion. In other words, Ethereum remains the go-to hub for overall “liquidity.” That said, locked TRX just hit a record 46.2 billion, or 48% of the total supply – A sign that TRON is quietly building a strong and resilient DeFi base. Source: CryptoQuant By comparison, Ethereum’s locked supply sits at just around 30%. From a technical perspective, TRON’s higher staking rate cuts down circulating supply pressure, helping it hold up better in volatile markets. At the same time, more stablecoins are flowing through its ecosystem. Together, high staking and USDT liquidity create a flywheel – Staked tokens cap volatility, while stablecoin dominance pulls in more users. As a result, TRON is quietly becoming the DeFi rail, running through Justin Sun now. Final Thoughts TRON captured 44.97% of USDT vs. Ethereum’s 44.56%, highlighting the growing importance of stablecoins in DeFi. With 48% of TRX locked and rising USDT flows, TRON is building a DeFi flywheel that reduces volatility and attracts users.
