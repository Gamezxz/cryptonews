The crypto market is facing one of the biggest dumps in recent times, according to CoinMarketCap . Top coins by CoinMarketCap BTC/USD The rate of Bitcoin (BTC) has declined by 4.79% over the last 24 hours. Image by TradingView On the daily chart, the price of BTC has made a false breakout of yesterday's bar's low at $62,200. Even if the bar closes far from that mark, the main crypto has not accumulated enough energy for a continued upward move. You Might Also Like In this case, sideways trading in the range of $63,000-$70,000 is the most likely scenario. Bitcoin is trading at $66,305 at press time. ETH/USD The rate of ETH has fallen by 6.7% since yesterday. Image by TradingView From the technical point of view, Ethereum (ETH) is trading similarly to BTC. The rate of the main altcoin is below the psychological mark of $2,000. Until its breakout happens, traders may expect a further decline to the $1,700-$1,800 range. Ethereum is trading at $1,923 at press time. XRP/USD XRP is the exception to the rule, rising by 0.92% over the last day. Image by TradingView On the daily time frame, the rate of XRP has bounced off the nearest support at $1.2543. However, buyers might need more time to accumulate energy for further growth. In this regard, sideways trading in the zone of $1.35-$1.50 is the most likely scenario over the next few days. XRP is trading at $1.3792 at press time. ADA/USD The price of Cardano (ADA) has fallen by 3.7%. Image by TradingView Despite today's growth, the rate of ADA remains under bears' pressure. Bulls may start thinking about a possible bounceback only if the rate fixes above the nearest level at $0.2756. Until it happens, traders may expect an ongoing correction. ADA is trading at $0.2634 at press time. SHIB/USD SHIB has kept up with most of the other coins, going down by 4.49%. Image by TradingView On the daily chart, the rate of SHIB has made a false breakout of the $0.00000543 level. If the candle closes far from that mark, the bounce back may continue to the $0.00000650 area. SHIB is trading at $0.00000604 at press time.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"698600e7bd1d672632b58a64","guid":"https://u.today/btc-eth-xrp-ada-and-shib-price-analysis-for-february-6","slug":"btc-eth-xrp-ada-and-shib-price-analysis-for-february-6","title":"BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA and SHIB Price Analysis for February 6","link":"https://u.today/btc-eth-xrp-ada-and-shib-price-analysis-for-february-6","pubDate":"2026-02-06T14:38:00.000Z","content":"Which coins are ready for a bounce back?","author":"Denys Serhiichuk","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/100160.jpg","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","category":"bitcoin","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum","altcoins"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"การวิเคราะห์ราคา BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA และ SHIB สำหรับวันที่ 6 กุมภาพันธ์","translatedContent":"เหรียญใดบ้างที่พร้อมจะดีดตัวกลับ?","sentiment":"neutral","fullContent":"$f","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":447,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T14:55:35.975Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T14:55:35.976Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T19:20:38.857Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69863f04f07b856ce09f6c9c","slug":"coinbases-crypto-backed-loans-notch-record-liquidations-amid-bitcoin-ethereum-pl","title":"Coinbase's Crypto-Backed Loans Notch Record Liquidations Amid Bitcoin, Ethereum Plunge","pubDate":"2026-02-06T19:19:12.000Z","source":"Decrypt","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"สินเชื่อที่รับประกันด้วย Crypto ของ Coinbase มียอด Liquidations สูงเป็นสถิติใหม่ขณะที่ราคา Bitcoin และ Ethereum ร่วงหลัก"},{"_id":"69863b7ebd1d672632b61777","slug":"dogecoin-price-slips-11-whats-next-as-1b-exits-doge","title":"Dogecoin price slips 11%: What’s next as $1B exits DOGE?","pubDate":"2026-02-06T19:00:19.000Z","source":"AMBCrypto","category":"altcoins","translatedTitle":"ราคา Dogecoin ดิ่งลง 11%: อะไรต่อไปเมื่อเงินมูลค่า 1 พันล้านดอลลาร์ไหลออกจาก DOGE?"},{"_id":"69863b7cbd1d672632b6160d","slug":"bitcoin-dips-to-60k-trm-labs-becomes-crypto-unicorn-finance-redefined","title":"Bitcoin dips to $60K, TRM Labs becomes crypto unicorn: Finance Redefined","pubDate":"2026-02-06T19:00:00.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin ร่วงลงสู่ระดับ 60,000 เหรียญ, TRM Labs กลายเป็น crypto unicorn: Finance Redefined"},{"_id":"69863a55bd1d672632b6159a","slug":"bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-eyes-big-rally-to-94k-after-forming-potential-botto","title":"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Eyes Big Rally To $94K After Forming Potential Bottom","pubDate":"2026-02-06T18:58:56.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคา Bitcoin: BTC มองการฟื้นตัวครั้งใหญ่ไปสู่ระดับ $94K หลังจากก่อตัวแนวรับที่เป็นไปได้"}]}],"$L10"]
