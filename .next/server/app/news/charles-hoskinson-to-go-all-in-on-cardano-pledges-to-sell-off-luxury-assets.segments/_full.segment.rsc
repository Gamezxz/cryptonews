10:T9dd,Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has signaled an intention to liquidate his real-world assets and focus on Cardano development. Previously, he announced plans to exit X (formerly Twitter), stating that posts on the platform would be made by an artificial intelligence (AI) twin. Charles Hoskinson To Sell Everything To Go Punk Rock In an X post , Hoskinson disclosed plans to sell his luxury assets, a move intended to remove distractions amid a flurry of incoming network developments. Hoskinson confirmed that the downsizing will include selling his Blackhawk helicopter, private jet, and Lamborghinis as he plans to be laser-focused on Cardano development. For Hoskinson, the plan is to go back to the “punk rock” roots, an ascetic and rebellious ideal that characterized the early days of cryptocurrencies. He defended his planned move as the ideal mental state for innovation, describing it as the “most fun” he ever had. “I’m going to get back to that punk rock root, downsize a little bit,” said Hoskinson. “Why not? I started from nothing.” He added that Cardano cannot reach its full potential if the development team continues to hedge its position, as other blockchains do. However, it remains unclear whether the proceeds from the asset sale will be allocated to Cardano development. Advertisement Opinion has been divided following Hoskinson’s announcement, with critics poking holes in his accumulation of luxury assets as Cardano’s founder. Others hailed his commitment to network development as a step in the right direction for Cardano and Midnight development. Since his announcement to downsize, Cardano has braved the broader cryptocurrency market slide, shedding only 1% of its market capitalization over the last day. Per CoinMarketCap data, ADA is trading at $0.29, with experts bullish over the price outlook despite the asset inching toward a two-year low. Hoskinson’s Activity Levels Spike After The Announcement Since the announcement, Hoskinson’s heat map indicates significant levels of ecosystem activity. The founder confirmed that the deployment of an agentic AI dubbed Logan for 24/7 Cardano posting on Moltbook, a social networking platform for AI agents. Meanwhile, Hoskinson has previously announced the signing of an integration agreement for USDCx on Cardano. After his hiatus from X , Hoskinson has confirmed plans for a two-week Japan tour to drum up support for Midnight, noting that the Far East country played a crucial role in the development of Cardano.5:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33847","guid":"https://zycrypto.com/?p=114643","__v":0,"aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","author":"Aliyu Pokima","categories":["altcoins"],"category":"altcoins","content":"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has signaled an intention to liquidate his real-world assets and focus on Cardano development.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T21:04:38.688Z","enclosure":"https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Cardano-Founder-Goes-Headfirst-Against-FUD-Amid-Incoming-Chang-Upgrade.jpeg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T21:04:38.317Z","fullContent":"$10","keyPoints":[],"link":"https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-to-go-all-in-on-cardano-pledges-to-sell-off-luxury-assets/","pubDate":"2026-02-05T18:51:55.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"bullish","slug":"charles-hoskinson-to-go-all-in-on-cardano-pledges-to-sell-off-luxury-assets","source":"ZyCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"Charles Hoskinson To Go All In On Cardano, Pledges To Sell Off Luxury Assets","translatedContent":"Charles Hoskinson ผู้ร่วมก่อตั้ง Cardano ได้แสดงความตั้งใจที่จะขายสินทรัพย์ในโลกแห่งความเป็นจริงและมุ่งเน้นไปที่การพัฒนา Cardano","translatedTitle":"Charles Hoskinson จะลงทุนอย่างเต็มที่กับ Cardano สัญญาจะขายสินทรัพย์หรู","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T06:01:08.047Z","wordCount":390,"translateRetries":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986d4f538f2116917d8e34f","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:56:18.000Z","slug":"decred-dcr-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-will-decred-price-hit-1000","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Decred (DCR) Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Will Decred Price Hit $1000?","translatedTitle":"การคาดการณ์ราคา Decred (DCR) 2026, 2027 – 2030: ราคา Decred จะเข้าถึง $1000 ได้ไหม?"},{"_id":"6986cf1438f2116917d87744","category":"altcoins","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:59.000Z","slug":"bitrue-expands-xrp-infrastructure-as-10-new-rlusd-pairs-go-live","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Bitrue Expands XRP Infrastructure as 10 New RLUSD Pairs Go Live","translatedTitle":"Bitrue ขยายโครงสร้าง XRP เมื่อ 10 คู่ใหม่ของ RLUSD เปิดใช้งาน"},{"_id":"6986d16c38f2116917d8b420","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:00.000Z","slug":"xrp-still-in-bull-market-versus-bitcoin-and-xrpbtc-chart-puts-51-upside-on-the-m","source":"U.Today","title":"XRP Still in Bull Market Versus Bitcoin, and XRP/BTC Chart Puts 51% Upside on the Menu","translatedTitle":"XRP ยังอยู่ในตลาดเพชรฟองต่อบิทคอยน์ และแผนภูมิ XRP/BTC มีศักยภาพเพิ่มขึ้น 51%"},{"_id":"6986d04238f2116917d89c1a","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:22:24.000Z","slug":"infinite-possibilities-announces-upcoming-launch-of-proof-of-activity-dex-and-ip","source":"CoinJournal","title":"Infinite Possibilities announces upcoming launch of Proof-of-Activity DEX and IP Membership program","translatedTitle":"Infinite Possibility ประกาศเปิดตัว DEX แบบ Proof-of-Activity และโปรแกรม IP Membership ในอนาคต"}]}],"$L11"]
