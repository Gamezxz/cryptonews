The first segment features Dor Eligula, Co-Founder of BridgeWise, discussing the integration of AI in investment research and analytics for brokers. He highlights growth opportunities in Asian markets, the synergy between automation and human analysis, and offers advice for retail investors on using AI tools effectively.

The second segment focuses on an interview with Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, who argues against the current proprietary trading model. Following a debate on the industry&#x27;s reliance on prop trading, Callan critiques the model for being overly dependent on fees, loose on risk management, and potentially misleading for retail clients.</p></div><div class="key-points"><h3>Key Points</h3><ul><li>BridgeWise Co-Founder Dor Eligula discusses AI&#x27;s role in broker analytics and Asian market expansion</li><li>Eligula highlights the balance between automation and human judgment in financial research</li><li>TRADU CEO Brendan Callan criticizes the current prop trading model&#x27;s risks and fee structures</li></ul></div></section><section class="article-body"><h2 class="section-label">Article</h2><div class="article-full-text"><p>Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide. We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error. We close with a practical question: how retail investors can actually use AI without falling into common traps.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading.
