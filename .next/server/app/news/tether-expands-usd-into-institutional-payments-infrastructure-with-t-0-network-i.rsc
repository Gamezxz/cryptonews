10:Tce6,Journalist Posted: February 7, 2026 Tether has announced a strategic investment in t-0 network , a USD₮-powered settlement platform designed for licensed financial institutions, marking a further push to extend the stablecoin into cross-border payments infrastructure. The initiative aims to enable near-instant, net-settled fiat-to-fiat transfers between banks and fintechs, using USD₮ as the underlying settlement layer. The system is positioned as a non-custodial network. It records and matches transactions across participating institutions before settling net balances on-chain. From trading liquidity to settlement use cases USD₮ has long played a central role in crypto market liquidity, particularly during periods of market stress. Tether’s move into payments infrastructure reflects a broader effort to adapt stablecoin usage toward settlement and treasury functions. Paolo Ardoino, chief executive of Tether, said the investment was intended to address inefficiencies in international payments rather than target consumer-facing use cases. “The t-0 network directly addresses the complexity of international payments by combining real-time settlement, cost efficiency, FX transparency, and global reach,” Ardoino said, adding that Tether aims to support infrastructure that can scale across regulated markets. Why the timing matters The announcement follows a period in which USD₮ supply expanded even as the broader crypto market contracted. In the final quarter of 2025, Tether’s circulating supply grew while overall crypto market capitalization fell sharply. This suggests capital rotation into stablecoins rather than a full withdrawal from on-chain markets. That divergence has reinforced USD₮’s role as a defensive liquidity layer, helping explain why settlement-oriented infrastructure is now a strategic focus. Institutional focus over retail adoption Unlike consumer payment applications, the t-0 network is explicitly designed for banks and regulated financial institutions. It connects participants through a single API and settles only net balances in each institution’s chosen currency, reducing prefunding requirements and limiting foreign exchange exposure. James Brownlee, chief executive of t-0 network, said the system was built to simplify cross-border payments for institutional users. “Our goal is to make global payments feel local,” Brownlee said, describing the platform as a way to reduce friction between developed and emerging markets without requiring institutions to overhaul existing systems. Incremental shift, not immediate disruption Tether did not disclose the size of its investment or provide a timeline for commercial rollout. No transaction volumes or participating institutions have yet been announced. While stablecoin-based settlement systems are increasingly discussed as alternatives to correspondent banking, adoption is likely to remain gradual and shaped by regulatory clarity, integration challenges, and demonstrated reliability at scale. Final Thoughts Tether’s investment reflects growing demand for USD₮ as institutional settlement liquidity rather than purely trading collateral. Stablecoins are edging closer to payments infrastructure, but widespread adoption remains incremental and regulation-dependent.5:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"_id":"698644ff4007f0a6ec7f3356","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=568372","slug":"tether-expands-usd-into-institutional-payments-infrastructure-with-t-0-network-i","title":"Tether expands USD₮ into institutional payments infrastructure with t-0 network investment","link":"https://ambcrypto.com/tether-expands-usd%e2%82%ae-into-institutional-payments-infrastructure-with-t-0-network-investment/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T19:42:08.000Z","content":"Tether is pushing USD₮ further into institutional payments infrastructure with an investment in the t-0 network.","author":"Adewale Olarinde","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Adewale-3-1-4.png","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","category":"ethereum","categories":["ethereum"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"Tether ขยายบทบาท USD₮ เข้าสู่โครงสร้างพื้นฐานการชำระเงินระดับสถาบันด้วยการลงทุนใน t-0 network","translatedContent":"Tether กำลังผลักดัน USD₮ ให้ก้าวไปข้างหน้าในโครงสร้างพื้นฐานการชำระเงินระดับสถาบันด้วยการลงทุนใน t-0 network","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$10","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":441,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T19:46:07.590Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T19:46:07.591Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T05:35:16.333Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986c80a38f2116917d83574","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T04:00:44.000Z","slug":"ethereum-free-fall-accelerates-as-fidelitys-feth-leads-etf-outflows-and-key-supp","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Ethereum Free Fall Accelerates as Fidelity’s FETH Leads ETF Outflows and Key Support Levels Crack","translatedTitle":"การล่มหนีของ Ethereum เร่งความเร็วเมื่อ Fidelity's FETH นำการออกจาก ETF และระดับรองรับสำคัญแตก"},{"_id":"6986b43038f2116917d771d1","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T03:35:00.000Z","slug":"xrp-spot-etfs-lead-crypto-inflows-but-prices-refuse-to-budge","source":"DailyCoin","title":"XRP Spot ETFs Lead Crypto Inflows, but Prices Refuse to Budge","translatedTitle":"กองทุน ETF แบบ Spot ของ XRP นำด้านการรับเงินเข้าในตลาด Crypto แต่ราคาไม่เคลื่อนไหว"},{"_id":"6986abea38f2116917d7201b","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T03:00:33.000Z","slug":"bitcoins-biggest-holders-pull-back-control-68-of-supply","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Bitcoin’s Biggest Holders Pull Back, Control 68% Of Supply","translatedTitle":"ทำเนียบ Bitcoin หลักหนีออกมา ครองเพียง 68% ของยอดจำนวน Bitcoin ทั้งหมด"},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c3a","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:00:16.000Z","slug":"tether-bets-big-on-gold-with-150-million-investment-in-goldcom","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Tether Bets Big On Gold With $150 Million Investment In Gold.com","translatedTitle":"เทเธอร์ลงทุนในทองคำอย่างใหญ่หลวงด้วยการลงทุน 150 ล้านดอลลาร์ใน Gold.com"}]}],"$L11"]
