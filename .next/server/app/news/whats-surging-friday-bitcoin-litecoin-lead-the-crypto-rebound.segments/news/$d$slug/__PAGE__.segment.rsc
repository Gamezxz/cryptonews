4:Tae4,Friday’s market saw a notable recovery in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin and Litecoin leading the charge. Bitcoin’s bounce from the $60,000 level helped ease fears of a deeper market correction, as it rose nearly 8% to reclaim the $70,000 mark. This surge also supported riskier altcoins like Litecoin, which is up about 8% for the day. Summary Bitcoin surged nearly 8% to reclaim the $70,000 level on Friday, easing fears of a deeper correction and supporting altcoins like Litecoin and Shiba Inu. Litecoin saw an 8% increase, trading around $54, as traders rotated into altcoins following Bitcoin’s recovery and reduced margin stress. Shiba Inu climbed about 7%, benefiting from Bitcoin’s rebound and renewed investor interest in higher-beta tokens. Why Bitcoin’s rise bodes well for Litecoin Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset in the crypto space, and when it rallies, traders typically rotate into altcoins like Litecoin. As Bitcoin stabilizes, the risk of forced selling and liquidation cascades decreases, allowing traders to take fresh positions in altcoins. This is particularly important after Bitcoin touched the $60,074 mark earlier on Friday, a key level that had traders on edge. The rebound reduced margin stress and bolstered sentiment across the market. Bitcoin’s price recovery also helped offset the concerns raised by figures like Michael Burry, who warned that miners could be forced to sell their Bitcoin holdings if the price dropped below $50,000. Litecoin’s Friday spike Litecoin, created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, has seen an uptick in interest as Bitcoin recovers. Known as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” Litecoin benefits from a long track record and strong exchange support. As of Friday, Litecoin is trading around $54, having hit an intraday high of $56.25.

As Bitcoin recovered from its Thursday slump, large investors redeployed capital across the market, pulling speculative coins like Shiba Inu back into the green. SHIB, which had faced pressure earlier in the week from market weakness and liquidations, is now benefiting from improved market sentiment. Source: CoinGecko What’s next for crypto? Bitcoin’s recovery is giving traders a window to reposition in the market, but caution remains. Analysts suggest that while short-term bounces are possible, broader market trends still point to volatility. Key resistance for Bitcoin sits in the $70,000 to $75,000 range, with some traders speculating on further upward movement. For now, the surge in Bitcoin’s price is driving positive sentiment in the market, with altcoins like Litecoin and Shiba Inu benefiting from the rebound.0:{"buildId":"Ft_4-0J49kAoS2_SwQXOc","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69866ba338f2116917d442b7","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448762","__v":0,"aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","author":"Caroline Álvarez","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Friday's market saw a notable recovery in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin and Litecoin leading the charge.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T22:30:59.903Z","enclosure":"https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2023/12/crypto-news-altcoin-surge-option04.webp","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T22:30:54.339Z","fullContent":"$4","keyPoints":[],"link":"https://crypto.news/whats-surging-friday-bitcoin-litecoin-lead-crypto/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T22:28:58.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"bullish","slug":"whats-surging-friday-bitcoin-litecoin-lead-the-crypto-rebound","source":"Crypto.news","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"What’s surging Friday?
