4:Ta0a,Bitcoin is now below $80,000 per coin. The leading digital asset over a one-year period has shed more than 25% of its value. Crypto markets have struggled to recover since the October 10 liquidation event. Bitcoin on Saturday dropped below $80,000 per coin for the first time since April as a crypto selloff intensified. The biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was recently priced at $79,113 after dropping 4% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko. Over the past week, it has dropped by more than 11%. Year-to-date, the leading digital asset is also down 11%. The selloff comes as investors this week pulled nearly $1.5 billion out of US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to data from Farside Investors. The funds, managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, offer investors quick and easy exposure to the cryptocurrency. Intensifying the price dip is futures traders getting liquidated. Over the past 24 hours alone, $1.6 billion in positions have been closed, according to Coinglass. The vast majority of those positions were longs — traders betting on the future prices of digital assets going up. Government shutdown — again Outflows from the funds have intensified in recent weeks as fears around geopolitics and a US government shutdown. The US government shut down partially Saturday in what is expected to be a brief event. President Donald Trump this week said he’d work with Democrats to prevent a long government closure. But last year’s shutdown hurt crypto prices — and they have struggled to recover since. Bitcoin’s price was also hurt earlier in the week on a tech stock selloff. Crypto markets have moved with equities since last year. Ethereum also took a hit and was trading for nearly $2,401 — a 24-hour dip of more than 12%. Other major coins and tokens experienced big drops too, with XRP and Solana dropping 10% and 11%, respectively. Crypto market movers Bitcoin is down 4% over the past 24 hours, trading at 78,904. Ethereum has dropped harder and is down nearly 12% past 24 hours at nearly $2,396.

Additionally, investors have withdrawn nearly $1.5 billion from US Bitcoin ETFs managed by major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, contributing to the downward pressure. Other major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, XRP, and Solana have also experienced significant drops. The market decline has been fueled by multiple factors including concerns over a partial US government shutdown, which historically has negatively impacted crypto prices. Bitcoin's correlation with tech stocks has also weakened its position, as equity markets experienced a selloff earlier in the week.","aiSummaryThai":"บิทคอยน์พลางตกลงต่ำกว่า 80,000 ดอลลาร์สหรัฐต่อเหรียญ ซึ่งเป็นครั้งแรกนับตั้งแต่เดือนเมษายน โดยมีมูลค่าลดลง 25% ในระยะเวลาหนึ่งปีที่ผ่านมา การขายออกอย่างรุนแรงได้ถูกขยายออกไปโดยการตัดสินใจขายสินทรัพย์ฟิวเจอร์สที่รวมมูลค่าถึง 16,000 ล้านดอลลาร์ภายใน 24 ชั่วโมงที่ผ่านมา ส่วนใหญ่เป็นตำแหน่งการเทรดแบบยาว นอกจากนี้ นักลงทุนยังถอนเงินออกจากกองทุน ETF ของบิทคอยน์ในสหรัฐมูลค่า 1,500 ล้านดอลลาร์ สกุลเงินดิจิทัลสำคัญอื่นๆ เช่น อีเธอเรียม (Ethereum), XRP และ Solana ก็ประสบกับการลดลงครั้งใหญ่เช่นกัน","keyPoints":["Bitcoin drops below $80,000 for first time since April","$$1.6 billion in futures liquidations intensify selloff","$$1.5 billion outflows from US Bitcoin ETFs"],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":431,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.897Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.897Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T05:40:18.068Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986d04138f2116917d89c09","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:54.000Z","slug":"google-search-volume-for-bitcoin-skyrockets-amid-btc-price-swings","source":"Cointelegraph","title":"Google search volume for 'Bitcoin' skyrockets amid BTC price swings","translatedTitle":"ปริมาณการค้นหา 'Bitcoin' บน Google พุ่งสูงสุดขึ้นเมื่อราคา BTC ผันผัน"},{"_id":"6986cde738f2116917d86b4a","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:27:34.000Z","slug":"nft-sales-plunge-20-to-583-million-as-bitcoin-price-struggles-at-70000","source":"Crypto.news","title":"NFT sales plunge 20% to $58.3 million as Bitcoin price struggles at $70,000","translatedTitle":"ยอดขาย NFT ลดลง 20% เหลือ 58.3 ล้านดอลลาร์ เมื่อราคา Bitcoin ต่ำกว่า 70,000 ดอลลาร์"},{"_id":"6986c80a38f2116917d83573","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:25.000Z","slug":"metaplanet-pushes-ahead-with-bitcoin-buying-amid-market-gloom","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Metaplanet Pushes Ahead With Bitcoin Buying Amid Market Gloom","translatedTitle":"Metaplanet ดำเนินการต่อไปด้วยการซื้อ Bitcoin ในช่วงที่ตลาดคริปโตกำลังลดลง"},{"_id":"6986c80a38f2116917d83574","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T04:00:44.000Z","slug":"ethereum-free-fall-accelerates-as-fidelitys-feth-leads-etf-outflows-and-key-supp","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Ethereum Free Fall Accelerates as Fidelity’s FETH Leads ETF Outflows and Key Support Levels Crack","translatedTitle":"การล่มหนีของ Ethereum เร่งความเร็วเมื่อ Fidelity's FETH นำการออกจาก ETF และระดับรองรับสำคัญแตก"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
