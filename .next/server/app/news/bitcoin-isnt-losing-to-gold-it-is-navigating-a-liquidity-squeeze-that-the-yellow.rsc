f:T1618,QCP's Darius Sit says October's deleveraging event exposed the real divide: bitcoin trades like collateral, altcoins trade like a bet on exchange governance Feb 6, 2026, 2:36 a.m. Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The market has been asking whether bitcoin is losing to gold. Darius Sit, co-founder and Managing Partner at QCP Capital, says the debate is often framed around price when liquidity realities matter more. Singapore-based QCP is one of Asia's largest trading desks, with over $60 billion in annual volume. STORY CONTINUES BELOW “If you’re comparing Bitcoin to gold, it’s not a like-for-like comparison… you’re talking about almost like a mouse versus an elephant kind of comparison,” Sit told CoinDesk. “You have two different sets of idiosyncratic market forces affecting market price in the short term, but on the longer-term narrative, I think, [they] remain quite similar.” Gold’s dominance reflects sovereign demand, entrenched market structure, and sheer scale. Bitcoin’s lag owes more to position unwinds than thesis collapse. Gold’s market cap is so large that its daily swings can exceed bitcoin’s entire valuation, turning short-term divergence into a physics problem rather than a narrative verdict. However, “in the longer term, narrative looks the same,” Sit said. A bigger inflection point, in his view, isn’t bullion’s rally but crypto’s Oct. 10 (now called 10/10) deleveraging event. That episode drew a hard line between bitcoin and the rest of the digital asset complex, exposing how liquidity and credit mitigation diverge once leverage snaps. “October 10 revealed that … there is a very clear line in terms of the liquidity between crypto, altcoins and bitcoin,” Sit said. The takeaway isn’t that crypto lost its appeal, but that much of the market discovered its true depth only after forced unwinds cleared the book. What remained was a thinner landscape where price moves sharply in either direction. One of the most important lessons of "10/10" was how crypto venues handle credit when things break. Sit drew a stark contrast with traditional markets, where layered broker and clearinghouse structures absorb shocks before losses reach end users. Native crypto exchanges, by comparison, often operate as single points of failure, relying on shareholder equity, insurance funds, and, in extreme cases, socialized loss. “The moment you trigger socialized loss, your platform will lose trust,” Sit said, describing what he views as the industry’s real institutional ceiling. Volatility isn’t the deterrent. The problem emerges when traders cannot predict how liquidations and counterparty risk will be managed in a stress event. Socialized loss occurs when an exchange's insurance fund cannot cover bankrupt positions, forcing the platform to close out profitable traders' positions to cover the shortfall, effectively making winners pay for others' losses. This happened on many major exchanges during the Oct. 10 market crash. He added that participants perceived the rules as inconsistent, with some products or counterparties appearing insulated while others absorbed the hit. That perception lingers longer than the price drawdown itself. Markets can rebuild leverage and volume, but trust in liquidation governance is slower to return. The result is a divided landscape where bitcoin retains credibility due to deeper liquidity and clearer use as collateral, while the broader altcoin complex trades with a structural discount tied less to macro direction than to venue design and counterparty confidence. In Sit’s view, bitcoin still behaves like a long-horizon inflation hedge and an increasingly legible form of collateral, whereas the broader altcoin universe is more directly subject to venue governance and order-book depth than to macro narratives alone. “When something has poor liquidity, it can go down a lot. It can go up a lot,” Sit said. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin swung violently but edged up about 5% in the last hour as extreme volatility followed a liquidation-driven plunge toward $60,000, with the RSI near 17 signaling historically oversold conditions that often precede sharp relief bounces even as price hovers near the $58,000 to $60,000 support zone. ETH: Ether traded around $1,895, rebounding about 7% in the past hour after a liquidation-driven selloff, with volatility surging as deeply oversold momentum conditions triggered a short-term relief bounce despite double-digit losses over the past 24 hours. Gold: Gold slipped about 3.7% to roughly $4,740 per ounce in a broad risk-asset pullback and profit-taking wave, but analysts argue the longer-term uptrend remains supported by persistent central-bank buying, debt and currency-confidence concerns, and forecasts that still see potential for prices to push toward $7,000 later in 2026 despite short-term volatility. Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 slipped about 1% to extend a three-day losing streak as a Wall Street tech rout spilled into Asia, dragging South Korea’s Kospi down as much as 5%, pressuring Hong Kong and Australian equities, and reinforcing a broader risk-off tone that also weighed on silver and other volatile assets.

He compares the two assets to a mouse and an elephant, noting that gold's massive market cap makes short-term price divergence irrelevant to its long-term thesis. Bitcoin's recent underperformance is attributed more to position unwinds and a liquidity squeeze than to a collapse in its fundamental value as an inflation hedge. The October 10 deleveraging event further highlighted the divergence between Bitcoin, which is trading as collateral, and altcoins, which are trading as bets on exchange governance. Sit emphasizes that the real institutional barrier for crypto is not volatility, but the risk of 'socialized loss' on exchanges during stress events, which destroys trust unlike traditional markets' layered clearinghouse structures.","aiSummaryThai":"Darius Sit จาก QCP Capital ชี้ว่า Bitcoin ไม่ได้แพ้ให้ Gold ในเชิงเรื่องราว แต่กำลังเผชิญกับสภาวะสภาพคล่องที่แตกต่างออกไป เขาเปรียบเทียบทั้งคู่ว่าเหมือนหนูกับช้าง โดยเน้นว่าขนาดตลาดที่ใหญ่โตของ Gold ทำให้การเคลื่อนไหวระยะสั้นไม่ส่งผลต่อภาพรวมในระยะยาว ส่วนการที่ Bitcoin ปรับตัวลดลงนั้นมาจากการปิดสถานะ (position unwinds) และการขาดสภาพคล่อง มากกว่าการพังทลายของหลักการลงทุนพื้นฐานในฐานะสินทรัพย์ป้องกันเงินเฟ้อ เหตุการณ์ถอดถอนความเสี่ยง (deleveraging) เมื่อวันที่ 10 ตุลาคม ยังเน้นย้ำความแตกต่างระหว่าง Bitcoin ที่ถูกมองเป็นหลักประกัน กับ Altcoins ที่ขึ้นอยู่กับการกำกับดูแลของ Exchange\n\nSit ระบุว่าอุปสรรคสำคัญต่อการเข้ามาของสถาบันในตลาด Crypto ไม่ใช่ความผันผวนของราคา แต่เป็นความเสี่ยงจากการกระจายความเสียหาย (socialized loss) บน Exchange ขณะเกิดวิกฤต ซึ่งทำลายความไว้วางใจต่างหากจากตลาดtrad-fi ที่มีโครงสร้างการชำระบัญชีแบบชั้นๆ ขณะเดียวกัน Bitcoin และ Ethereum กำลังฟื้นตัวขึ้นจากการขายทิ้งครั้งใหญ่ ในขณะที่ Gold และดัชนีหุ้นเอเชียปรับตัวลดลงตามภาวะความเสี่ยง (Risk-off)","fullContent":"$f","keyPoints":["Darius Sit compares Bitcoin to a mouse and Gold to an elephant, arguing that liquidity realities matter more than price comparisons.","The October 10 deleveraging event distinguished Bitcoin (as collateral) from altcoins (as bets on exchange governance).","Socialized loss mechanisms on crypto exchanges pose a greater threat to institutional trust than volatility.","Bitcoin and Ethereum are rebounding after liquidation-driven selloffs, while Gold and Asian stocks slipped."],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":862},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"698660ea38f2116917d3b76f","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:39:14.000Z","slug":"strategy-balance-sheet-stable-unless-btc-falls-below-this-critical-level","source":"CryptoPotato","title":"Strategy: Balance Sheet Stable Unless BTC Falls Below This Critical Level","translatedTitle":""},{"_id":"69865fc238f2116917d3abb9","category":"defi","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:36:40.000Z","slug":"inside-defi-003-insidedefi-003-crypto-in-crisis-defi-doomerism","source":"Protos","title":"Inside DeFi 003: 🛸 InsideDeFi 003: Crypto in crisis, DeFi doomerism","translatedTitle":"Inside DeFi 003: 🛸 InsideDeFi 003: Crypto อยู่ในวิกฤต, DeFi doomerism"},{"_id":"69865ee538f2116917d3a28a","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:35:04.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-whales-are-dumping-massive-amounts-of-supply-on-exchanges-as-liquidation","source":"CryptoSlate","title":"Bitcoin whales are dumping massive amounts of supply on exchanges as liquidations mirror the 2022 FTX market collapse","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin whales กำลังขายทิ้งจำนวนมหาศาลลงในตลาดแลกเปลี่ยน เมื่อการ Liquidation เหมือนกับการล่มสลายของตลาด FTX ปี 2022"},{"_id":"69865fc238f2116917d3abbb","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:30:37.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-hodlers-should-abandon-ship-says-peter-schiff-after-btc-dropped-to-60k","source":"ZyCrypto","title":"Bitcoin HODLers Should Abandon Ship, Says Peter Schiff After BTC Dropped to $60k","translatedTitle":"ผู้ถือ Bitcoin HODLers ควรออกจากเรือ, Peter Schiff กล่าวหลัง BTC ดิ่งถึง 60k"}]}],"$L10"]
