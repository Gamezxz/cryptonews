We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error. We close with a practical question: how retail investors can actually use AI without falling into common traps.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

doesn't\nsee limits to how fast it can grow, even after adding more clients last year\nthan it accumulated in its first 20 years of operation.\nOmar\nArnaout, the broker's chief executive, told Polish financial daily Parkiet that\nbringing in two million new accounts annually “is completely\nrealistic” within a few years. The Warsaw-listed company pulled in 864,000\nclients during 2025, a 73 percent jump that pushed its total base past 2.16\nmillion.\n“It\ntook us 20 years to have a million clients,” Arnaout said\nin the interview published this week. “In 2025, we acquired over\n860,000 clients. So in one year we did practically what took 20 years.”\nWhen asked\nwhere the ceiling is for client acquisition growth, Arnaout was blunt: “We\nstill don't see that ceiling.”\nXTB\nreported record fourth-quarter revenue of 610.1 million złoty ($173 million)\nand net profit of 180.5 million złoty in preliminary results released last month. For the full year, the company\nposted 644 million złoty in net profit, falling short of the billion-złoty\nthreshold that analysts have floated as the next psychological milestone.\nFlat Markets Masked Client\nGrowth Impact\nArnaout\nblamed sideways price action across most assets for keeping results below what\nthe expanding client base could have delivered. He said 2025 stood out for how\nmany instruments traded in tight ranges, limiting the volatility that typically\ndrives trading volume at contracts-for-difference brokers like XTB.\n“If\nconditions had been favorable, I think that billion really would have been\nbroken,” the CEO told Parkiet. The number of active clients climbed 70\npercent during the year, reaching 1.19 million, but many of those traders sat\non the sidelines when markets stalled.\nXTB added\n117,000 clients in the first 28 days of January alone, according to company\ndisclosures. Arnaout wouldn't discuss specific monthly performance but said his\npersonal goal for 2026 includes crossing the billion-złoty profit mark. The\ncompany has publicly committed to signing up one million new clients this year,\nwhich would work out to roughly 250,000 per quarter at minimum.\n“That's\nthe minimum,” Arnaout said. “Our aspirations are definitely\nbigger.”\nCrypto License Opens New\nRevenue Stream\nThe broker\nsecured approval from Cyprus regulators in December to offer spot\ncryptocurrency trading under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets framework.\nThat authorization came after months of\nlegislative gridlock in Poland, where President Karol Nawrocki vetoed crypto\nlegislation that parliament had passed.\nArnaout\nsees crypto as an entirely separate market from the stock and CFD traders XTB\nalready serves. Poland has more than two million brokerage accounts but an\nestimated three million people who own cryptocurrencies, he noted. Unlike the\nbroker's zero-commission stock and ETF products, crypto and options will carry\ntransaction fees.\n“If we\nadd cryptocurrencies to the offer, we're entering an entirely new business,\nwe're starting a completely different competitive battle,” Arnaout\nexplained. “That's a completely new client base, so I don't see that\nceiling.”\nXTB plans\nto launch spot crypto trading in Cyprus first, then roll out to other markets\nonce it clears regulatory hurdles in each jurisdiction. The company is waiting\nto see how Poland's legislative process plays out but won't delay indefinitely.\nArnaout said XTB will make a decision by the second quarter, or third quarter\nat the latest, on how to proceed.\nThe crypto\npush fits into Arnaout's broader vision of building what he described last year as a “super\napp” that handles everything from investing to payments. That strategy has\nalready reshaped the company's customer mix, with only 7 percent of new clients now choosing\nCFDs as their first transaction, down from 80 percent in 2019.\nOptions Already Live in\nCyprus\nThe broker\nbegan offering options trading to Cypriot clients late last year and expects to\nextend the service to at least one other European branch during the first\nquarter of 2026. Like crypto, options represent a fee-generating product that\ncould reduce XTB's dependence on CFD spreads for revenue.\n“If\nthe client base grows dynamically and interest in CFDs is maintained, that will\npositively impact our business,” Arnaout said. But he acknowledged that\nXTB's stock and ETF products, along with interest paid on idle cash, don't yet\nproduce meaningful income because the user base remains too small. Crypto and\noptions could change that math by adding paid services to the platform.\nThe company\nalso announced plans last week to introduce margin lending for stock purchases\nand extend trading hours to 24 hours a day, five days a week. Those announcements sent XTB shares up 12 percent\nin the biggest single-day jump since 2021, even as full-year profit dropped 25\npercent.\nCompetition Heats Up in\nPolish Market\nPoland\ncontinues to drive a disproportionate share of XTB's growth, even as the broker\noperates across multiple countries. Brand recognition has reached a point where\nXTB is often the first choice for Polish investors opening new accounts,\nArnaout said.\nBut rivals\nare circling. German fintech Trade Republic\nentered Poland last\nyear, launching a direct challenge to XTB's market leadership. ING Bank\nSecurities, the\ncountry's fourth-largest brokerage, is preparing its own offensive with\ntax-sheltered retirement accounts and expanded foreign market access.\n“I\nwould like to be able to say that we will have much greater diversification,\nbut at this pace of business development in Poland, it still seems unrealistic\nfor now, although foreign branches are also developing very quickly,” Arnaout told Parkiet.\nThe CEO\nsaid XTB won't sacrifice profitability to chase expansion in 2026. Marketing\nbudgets will stay aggressive because becoming Europe's largest retail broker\nrequires sustained ad spending, but other costs face tighter controls. \nHeadcount\nis budgeted to rise just one percent this year, the slowest pace in company\nhistory, though total personnel expenses will climb about 16 to 17 percent due\nto raises and other compensation adjustments.\n“Approaching\nthe budget for this year, for the first time we were very cautious,”\nArnaout said. “If I'm talking about my goals, I would like to exceed that\nbillion złoty profit this year.”\nClient\nassets held at XTB reached approximately 10.8 billion euros by the end of 2025.\nThe average cost to acquire each new account held steady at 700 złoty for the\nfull year and 600 złoty in the fourth quarter.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.
