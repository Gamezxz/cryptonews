4:Td47,Binance has bought another 3,600 BTC for its SAFU fund, lifting the stash to 6,230 BTC as it races to convert roughly $1B in user‑protection reserves into Bitcoin within 30 days. Summary Binance says it “completed the purchase of 3600 BTC for the SAFU Fund, amounting to 250M USD stablecoins,” and that its SAFU BTC address now holds 6,230 BTC as it works to finish the full $1B conversion window. ​ The exchange first announced the pivot on Jan. 29, promising to move about $1B in SAFU reserves out of dollar‑pegged tokens into BTC and to top the fund back up to $1B if market moves drag its value below $800M. ​ Binance frames the shift as a long‑term bet on Bitcoin as “the foundational asset of the crypto ecosystem,” even as BTC, ETH and SOL all trade lower amid a broader risk reset and calls for a potential slide toward the low‑$40,000s Binance has quietly turned its emergency war chest into a live buyer of market dips, confirming that its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) has snapped up another 3,600 bitcoin using roughly $250M in stablecoins. The move lifts the SAFU wallet’s on‑chain stash to 6,230 BTC as the exchange races to complete a previously announced conversion of the entire $1B fund into bitcoin within 30 days. In an update posted on X, Binance said it had “completed the purchase of 3600 BTC for the SAFU Fund, amounting to 250M USD stablecoins,” adding that “our SAFU BTC address now holds 6230 BTC” and that it is “continuing to acquire Bitcoin for the SAFU fund, aiming to complete conversion of the fund within 30 days of our original announcement.” The exchange first outlined the pivot on Jan. 29, pledging to move roughly $1B in SAFU reserves out of dollar‑pegged tokens and into BTC, and to top the fund back up to $1B if market swings drove its value below $800M. Binance has framed the shift as a statement of long‑term conviction, describing bitcoin as “the foundational asset of the crypto ecosystem” and positioning SAFU as a backstop that must hold assets that are transparent, auditable and resilient to inflation. As of early February, Binance says SAFU holds around $1B in crypto assets earmarked to protect users in the event of hacks or platform failures. Market reaction and price context The latest 3,600 BTC clip, valued around $233M at recent prices, adds to a series of purchases that have brought SAFU’s recent bitcoin buying close to $430M in just days, according to multiple market trackers. Commentators were quick to frame the move as both defensive and opportunistic, with one industry desk noting that Binance appears to be “buying the dip” for a fund designed to cushion future shocks. How Binance’s latest moving are shaping the crypto market This renewed accumulation comes as major digital assets struggle to steady after a sharp flush. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading near $66,600, down roughly 5% over the last 24 hours, with about $140B in turnover. Ethereum ( ETH ) changes hands just under $2,000, off around 7% on the day on elevated volumes, while Solana ( SOL ) hovers near $80 after a daily drawdown close to 10%. This parabolic move in SAFU’s positioning lands squarely in a market where bitcoin still trades as the purest expression of macro risk appetite , even as options data and volatile spot flows warn that a deeper reset toward the low‑$40,000s remains on the table.0:{"buildId":"nyNMduq-QDcIzXqHG9EwS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33825","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448643","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Binance has purchased an additional 3,600 BTC worth approximately $250 million for its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), bringing the fund's total Bitcoin holdings to 6,230 BTC.
