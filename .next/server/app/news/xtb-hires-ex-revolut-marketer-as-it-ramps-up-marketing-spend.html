He also identifies Asian markets as areas of &quot;blue ocean&quot; growth, influenced by local client behavior and demand.

Additionally, the article includes a discussion with Brendan Callan, CEO of TRADU, following a debate on Prop Trading. Callan argues against the industry&#x27;s current Prop Trading model, criticizing its heavy reliance on fees, loose risk controls, and the confusion it creates for retail audiences. He explains the reasons behind his stance which won the audience&#x27;s vote during the summit.</p></div><div class="key-points"><h3>Key Points</h3><ul><li>BridgeWise discusses the rollout of AI in investment research and Asian market growth</li><li>Dor Eligula emphasizes the combination of automation and human judgment in AI analytics</li><li>Brendan Callan of TRADU argues against the Prop Trading model citing fee dependency and risk issues</li></ul></div></section><section class="article-body"><h2 class="section-label">Article</h2><div class="article-full-text"><p>Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder &amp; Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide. We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
