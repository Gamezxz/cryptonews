10:T9bc,ACCM, a contracts for differences (CFD) broker focused on emerging markets, has entered motor racing, but not through the usual Formula 1 deals. Instead, it has become a multi-year sponsor of the Prima Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team.
Is MotoGP Going to Be the Next F1 for CFD Brokers?
Although a handful of other retail brokers have marketed their brands around top two-wheeler racing, it has yet to become mainstream like Formula 1. This also suggests that brokers can secure MotoGP sponsorship deals at a much lower cost than Formula 1 ones.
Although none of the Formula One teams or the brokers have officially revealed the financial terms of their deals, Libertex’s Chief Marketing Officer, Marios Chailis, said that the lowest-tier F1 sponsorship deal costs about $5 million.

“Partnering with Prima Pramac Yamaha allows us to connect our brand with a sport that reflects how modern trading works: fast-moving, data-driven, and powered by innovation,” said Tien Ching, CEO of ACCM, in a statement. This also highlights how the target customers of CFD brokers often align with motor racing fans.
Getting Exposure Is the Goal
ACCM operates under regulatory licences in Australia and South Africa, along with offshore licences in Seychelles and Vanuatu. According to SimilarWeb data, most of the brokerage’s website traffic comes from Vietnam and Thailand.
The latest sponsorship deal has made the broker the MotoGP team’s “Official Partner”, allowing it to place its branding across team assets and digital platforms. The broker will also gain access to a “range of other significant rights”.
The Pramac Yamaha MotoGP team also has a large social media following, with 560,000 followers on Instagram and another 560,000 on Facebook, meaning any promotion of the broker would reach a wide audience worldwide.
In addition, sponsor brands can gain visibility on MotoGP’s wider channels if placed well. These channels have more than 17.9 million followers on Instagram and over 7 million subscribers on YouTube.
While football and Formula 1 remain the top sports marketing choices for CFD brokers, many are now turning to niche local sports to better target their key markets. The number of broker deals with individuals and teams in mixed martial arts, cricket, rugby, and other niche sports continues to grow.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
