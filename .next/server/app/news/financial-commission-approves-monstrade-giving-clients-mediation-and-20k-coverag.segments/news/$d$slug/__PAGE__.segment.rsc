4:T932,The Financial Commission has approved Monstrade as its
newest Member. Monstrade was founded by a group of asset managers with experience
in Dubai’s financial sector. The company initially provided data services to
large institutions, financial support to fintech start-ups, and liquidity
solutions to institutional counterparties. It has since grown into a forex
broker.
The move follows the Commission’s recent certification of
trading technology provider iTech Software. The certification confirmed that its
systems meet standards for brokers and traders. iTech provides technology
solutions for Forex, CFD, crypto, and NFT brokerages, including web trader
platforms, back-office infrastructure, and live support with monitoring and
risk management.
Financial Commission Provides €20K Complaint Protection
As an Approved Broker Member, Monstrade and its customers
can access a range of services offered by the Financial Commission. These
include protection for up to €20,000 per complaint, supported by the
Commission’s Compensation Fund.
The Financial Commission serves as an independent
third-party mediation platform. It resolves complaints when parties cannot
reach an agreement directly. For members operating in CFDs, forex, and
cryptocurrency markets, the platform offers a faster and simpler alternative to
arbitration or local courts.
Commission Warns Against Impersonation Scam Activity
In a separate update, the Financial
Commission confirmed RA Prime as a member. The brokerage provides foreign
exchange and CFD products globally. Other recent additions to the organization
include FP Markets, OneRoyal, FXON, GTCFX, and Neex,
an online brokerage offering access to Forex, indices, and commodities.
The Commission also provided an update on an investigation
into individuals falsely claiming to represent the organization. These
imposters targeted traders reporting losses or blocked withdrawals from brokers
such as Umarkets and TPG Deals. 
They offered purported fund recovery or chargeback services
in exchange for fees and issued counterfeit guarantee letters through entities
claiming to be legal firms, including Orbital Limited and AK Law. The scammers
also used fake contact details resembling legitimate digital wallet providers
to mislead victims.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
