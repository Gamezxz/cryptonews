Amid the bearish outlook of the leading cryptocurrency asset, Bitcoin (BTC), some stakeholders remain concerned about quantum threats. One of them, Capriole founder Charles Edwards, insists that quantum computing threats are real and long-term issues that need urgent attention and action. Quantum computing risk not Bitcoin price driver According to Edwards, there is a strong need in 2026 to tackle the potential challenges that quantum computers could pose to Bitcoin. He maintains that the Bitcoin community has to do something to secure the asset and other blockchains, not in the future but now. Meanwhile, Edwards says quantum computer threats do not justify the current bearish price of Bitcoin. "It does not justify prices of $60K today, it's more than fully priced in," Edwards wrote. Notably, some segments of the crypto community argue that Bitcoin’s price should be high right now because of looming quantum risk. They believe that upgrades would make Bitcoin stronger and safe, thereby increasing its value. The Quantum threat is big and must be addressed with urgency this year. That said, it does not justify prices of $60K _today_, it's more than fully priced in. — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) February 6, 2026 Additionally, with "race to safety" narratives circulating, Bitcoin should begin to climb in value. However, Edwards says this logic is not sound as quantum risk is not a valid reason because the market has already accounted for the quantum narrative. It appears that a Bitcoin accumulator, Strategy’s Michael Saylor , is already making moves to address quantum computer threats. As per reports, Strategy is planning to launch a Bitcoin security program that would tap into communities for solutions to the threat. However, unlike Edwards, Saylor believes the threat is still more than 10 years away, and most industry players are still relying on traditional cryptography. He thinks that a shift to protect against quantum threats would be arrived at via consensus. Another renowned voice in the industry, Craig Wright — the self-styled Satoshi Nakamoto from Australia — has dismissed threats from quantum computers . Wright refers to the narratives as "bedtime stories." He insists that the fears are just noise, as no quantum computer can break a hash.

A Google veteran, Graham Cooke , has stated that the math behind wallets remain stronger than the "fabric of space time." He argues that even if there are advances in quantum computing, the mathematics protecting digital assets remain foolproof against any threats. For his part, JAN3 CEO Samson Mow has said people in the crypto space should stop stressing themselves over the "wrong things" when reacting to quantum threats. Mow maintained there is no need to worry.5:T41a,Capriole founder Charles Edwards asserts that while the threat of quantum computing to Bitcoin (BTC) is a real and urgent long-term issue, it does not justify the asset's current bearish price action. He argues that the market has "more than fully priced in" the quantum risk, dismissing claims that Bitcoin should command a premium now due to potential future security upgrades. Edwards emphasizes the need for the Bitcoin community to act immediately to secure the network against these threats.

However, industry leaders offer varying perspectives on the severity and timeline of the quantum risk. Strategy's Michael Saylor is preparing a Bitcoin security program to crowdsource solutions, yet he estimates the threat is still over a decade away and will be addressed via consensus. Conversely, prominent skeptics like Craig Wright and Google veteran Graham Cooke downplay the narrative, with Wright calling it a "bedtime story" and Cooke maintaining that the mathematical foundations of wallets remain superior to potential quantum
