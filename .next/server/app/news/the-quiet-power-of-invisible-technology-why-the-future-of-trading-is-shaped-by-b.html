The trading industry has become increasingly focused on what is visible to the end user. AI-powered assistants, automated insights, and increasingly sophisticated interfaces now dominate product launches and marketing narratives. Innovation is often judged by the features traders touch, rather than by the systems that determine what actually happens when an order hits the market. This creates a blind spot. In calm conditions, many platforms look capable. Prices move smoothly, orders are filled without friction, and spreads behave as expected. But calm markets can disguise meaningful differences in how trading platforms are built, supported, and engineered for scale. When markets stop behaving calmly, those differences stop being theoretical. Surprise data releases, geopolitical developments, and sudden shifts in liquidity place very different demands on technology. Trading engines can look identical on the surface, but their behavior under stress depends on what sits behind them: capacity, execution locations, redundancy, and failover design. In those moments, innovation is experienced less through features and more through pricing coherence and execution quality. This is why the industry focus is gradually shifting. The question is no longer which platform looks most advanced. It is which systems remain most predictable when markets accelerate. Technology that disappears into the experience In many fields, the most effective technology is often the least visible. When something works perfectly, it fades into the background. The user doesn’t notice the engineering; they notice the absence of friction. In trading, we follow a similar logic. Some traders may experiment with AI-generated insights or predictive tools. But what matters most in real trading conditions is simpler: execution that behaves consistently, prices that make sense, and systems that remain stable when markets become chaotic. This is where technology delivers its greatest value: beneath the surface, in how systems are designed, monitored, and refined over time. At Exness, improvements to pricing behavior, liquidity handling, and execution stability are initiated and shaped by people, engineers, product specialists, and analysts, who understand how markets behave under stress. Data analytics and automation help teams stress-test behaviour, detect anomalies earlier, and refine execution logic over time. But accountability remains human-led. Someone designs it, someone monitors it, and someone owns the outcome. Calm markets can hide a weak trading engine Quiet markets allow fragile systems to operate without drawing attention to their limitations. Under these conditions, many platforms appear competent. Take a trader entering a silver trade right after a high-impact event. With one broker, spreads widen to reduce broker risk, execution slows as liquidity deteriorates, and the order is filled meaningfully away from the intended level. With another, spreads stay tight, execution remains fast, and sufficient volume is available at the displayed prices to support clean fills. The trade idea may be identical, but the outcome diverges as the platforms behave differently under stress. This is what volatility reveals. Spreads may widen unexpectedly, execution can become inconsistent, liquidity may thin, and prices can gap. Orders that are usually executed predictably may deviate from expectations through slippage or delayed execution. Traders may interpret these outcomes as failure of discipline or strategy. In practice, the cause can be structural. When a trading platform degrades under pressure, even well-considered decisions can produce distorted results. Why trust is the real competitive layer As trading technology grows more capable, trust becomes both more fragile and complex. Faster systems and increased automation can improve efficiency, but they can also make outcomes harder to interpret. Many of these improvements are rarely visible. Execution safeguards and stability mechanisms are often understated. Their impact is felt indirectly: fewer disruptions, more predictable costs, and outcomes that better align with intent. In this environment, trust is formed through experience rather than promises. Traders observe how execution behaves during volatility, how trading costs evolve under stress, and whether platform behaviour remains consistent when conditions change. Over time, predictability becomes a practical advantage. Performance under stress is not only a technical question but also a commercial one. In volatile moments, brokers and liquidity providers face a choice: maintain competitive conditions and take on more risk, or degrade conditions defensively and reduce it. Traders experience this through spread behaviour and execution quality. The drivers sit deeper: risk posture, liquidity access, and the platform’s ability to handle stress. Some market participants, like Exness, place more emphasis on how their systems behave under pressure than on surface-level features with limited impact on traders’ experience. This reflects a wider industry discussion: features matter less when they do not translate into better execution, more reliable pricing, or lower friction. The most valuable uses, including AI, are those that reduce a user’s cognitive and production load. In other words, they strengthen understanding, not substitute judgment. Technology is at its most effective when it simplifies the complex and reinforces autonomy, rather than overriding it. Ultimately, the value of any tool must be measured by its outcome: does it lead to more reliable pricing, lower friction, and a more resilient decision-making process?. The structural foundations of execution under stress Designing systems for volatile conditions requires a different architectural focus. One priority is the integration of pricing and execution. When quoting and order routing operate as one coherent mechanism, prices are more likely to reflect tradable conditions and execution is more likely to align with what traders expect at entry. Another is liquidity at scale. Depth becomes most visible when volatility increases and order sizes grow. A platform that can absorb larger trades without amplifying market impact helps preserve pricing integrity under stress. A third consideration is resilience and monitoring. Reliability is built into the architecture: geographically distributed execution locations to reduce latency, redundant routes to avoid single points of failure, and automated failover so the platform can keep operating even if one component degrades. But architecture alone is not enough. Continuous monitoring is what makes reliability operational, tracking server loads, latency, rejection rates, slippage, and price behaviour so stress is detected early and capacity can be rebalanced before it shows up for traders as wider spreads, delayed fills, or inconsistent pricing. Finally, there is a structural divide between platforms that are largely outsourced and those engineered in-house. Many brokers rely on ready-made third-party systems: fast to implement, easy to integrate, sufficient in normal conditions. But the trade-off is flexibility to improve. Performance depends on how the external solution handles routing, liquidity access, and volatility. Brokers with scale often invest in in-house technology to retain control over those key components. It allows them to fine-tune behaviour under volatility and maintain consistent performance when conditions stop being predictable. Build for the moments that matter Many visible AI features are designed for stable conditions, where execution quality is treated as given. In calm environments, speed and convenience are a given. But when volatility rises, assumptions break: spreads degrade, liquidity thins, and execution becomes the differentiator. At that point, real innovation is less about what the interface claims to do and more about whether the platform maintains coherent pricing and predictable fills when the market accelerates. As the industry integrates increasingly powerful tools, the question becomes less about whether AI is present and more about how it is applied. A trading platform designed with stress in mind does not eliminate uncertainty, but it can change how that uncertainty is experienced. Over time, that distinction will shape how traders evaluate platforms, and how trust is earned. The trading industry has become increasingly focused on what is visible to the end user.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

In calm conditions, many platforms look capable. Prices move smoothly, orders are filled without friction, and spreads behave as expected. But calm markets can disguise meaningful differences in how trading platforms are built, supported, and engineered for scale.\nWhen markets stop behaving calmly, those differences stop being theoretical. Surprise data releases, geopolitical developments, and sudden shifts in liquidity place very different demands on technology.

The question is no longer which platform looks most advanced. It is which systems remain most predictable when markets accelerate.\nTechnology that disappears into the experience\nIn many fields, the most effective technology is often the least visible.

In trading, we follow a similar logic.\nSome traders may experiment with AI-generated insights or predictive tools.

With one broker, spreads widen to reduce broker risk, execution slows as liquidity deteriorates, and the order is filled meaningfully away from the intended level.

The trade idea may be identical, but the outcome diverges as the platforms behave differently under stress. \nThis is what volatility reveals.

In practice, the cause can be structural. When a trading platform degrades under pressure, even well-considered decisions can produce distorted results. \nWhy trust is the real competitive layer\nAs trading technology grows more capable, trust becomes both more fragile and complex. Faster systems and increased automation can improve efficiency, but they can also make outcomes harder to interpret.\nMany of these improvements are rarely visible. Execution safeguards and stability mechanisms are often understated. Their impact is felt indirectly: fewer disruptions, more predictable costs, and outcomes that better align with intent.\nIn this environment, trust is formed through experience rather than promises. Traders observe how execution behaves during volatility, how trading costs evolve under stress, and whether platform behaviour remains consistent when conditions change. Over time, predictability becomes a practical advantage.\nPerformance under stress is not only a technical question but also a commercial one. In volatile moments, brokers and liquidity providers face a choice: maintain competitive conditions and take on more risk, or degrade conditions defensively and reduce it. Traders experience this through spread behaviour and execution quality. The drivers sit deeper: risk posture, liquidity access, and the platform’s ability to handle stress.\nSome market participants, like Exness, place more emphasis on how their systems behave under pressure than on surface-level features with limited impact on traders’ experience. This reflects a wider industry discussion: features matter less when they do not translate into better execution, more reliable pricing, or lower friction.\nThe most valuable uses, including AI, are those that reduce a user’s cognitive and production load. In other words, they strengthen understanding, not substitute judgment. Technology is at its most effective when it simplifies the complex and reinforces autonomy, rather than overriding it. Ultimately, the value of any tool must be measured by its outcome: does it lead to more reliable pricing, lower friction, and a more resilient decision-making process?.\nThe structural foundations of execution under stress\nDesigning systems for volatile conditions requires a different architectural focus. \nOne priority is the integration of pricing and execution. When quoting and order routing operate as one coherent mechanism, prices are more likely to reflect tradable conditions and execution is more likely to align with what traders expect at entry.\nAnother is liquidity at scale. Depth becomes most visible when volatility increases and order sizes grow. A platform that can absorb larger trades without amplifying market impact helps preserve pricing integrity under stress.\nA third consideration is resilience and monitoring. Reliability is built into the architecture: geographically distributed execution locations to reduce latency, redundant routes to avoid single points of failure, and automated failover so the platform can keep operating even if one component degrades. But architecture alone is not enough. Continuous monitoring is what makes reliability operational, tracking server loads, latency, rejection rates, slippage, and price behaviour so stress is detected early and capacity can be rebalanced before it shows up for traders as wider spreads, delayed fills, or inconsistent pricing.\nFinally, there is a structural divide between platforms that are largely outsourced and those engineered in-house. Many brokers rely on ready-made third-party systems: fast to implement, easy to integrate, sufficient in normal conditions. But the trade-off is flexibility to improve. Performance depends on how the external solution handles routing, liquidity access, and volatility.\nBrokers with scale often invest in in-house technology to retain control over those key components. It allows them to fine-tune behaviour under volatility and maintain consistent performance when conditions stop being predictable.\nBuild for the moments that matter\nMany visible AI features are designed for stable conditions, where execution quality is treated as given. In calm environments, speed and convenience are a given. But when volatility rises, assumptions break: spreads degrade, liquidity thins, and execution becomes the differentiator.\nAt that point, real innovation is less about what the interface claims to do and more about whether the platform maintains coherent pricing and predictable fills when the market accelerates.\nAs the industry integrates increasingly powerful tools, the question becomes less about whether AI is present and more about how it is applied.

Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
