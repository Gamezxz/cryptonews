4:T9f2,Ripple and XRPL developers say recent mainnet upgrades and upcoming features position the XRP Ledger as a hub for regulated, real-world finance. Updated Feb 6, 2026, 1:05 p.m. Published Feb 6, 2026, 12:54 p.m. Ripple and XRPL contributors have outlined a growing set of “institutional DeFi” building blocks on the XRP Ledger that aim to make the network viable for regulated financial activity, per a Thursday blog. XRP’s utility as a settlement and bridge asset is being highlighted as central to that infrastructure, with usecases ranging from from forex and stablecoin rails to tokenized collateral and native lending markets. STORY CONTINUES BELOW The latest roadmap emphasizes features already live — such as multi-purpose token standards (MPT), permissioned domains with compliance tooling, credential-backed access and batch transactions — alongside upcoming releases that extend XRPL into credit markets and privacy-preserving workflows. Unlike many smart contract chains that bolt on compliance after the fact, XRPL’s approach has been to embed identity and control primitives at the protocol layer. Permissioned domains and credentials allow markets to gate participation by verified entities, a requirement institutions often cite as a barrier to onchain integration. On the payments and FX side, XRP’s role as an auto-bridge between assets continues to be cited as a demand driver, with stablecoin corridors and remittance flows adding to onchain volume and fee activity. Token escrows and object reserves denominated in XRP further tie network usage back to the native asset. Looking ahead, the introduction of XLS-65/66 — the XRPL lending protocol — is slated to offer pooled and underwritten credit on ledger without entirely offloading risk logic onchain. Single asset vaults, fixed-term lending and optional permissioning tools are designed to feel familiar to institutional risk managers while operating in an onchain settlement context. Privacy features like confidential transfers for MPTs, arriving in the first quarter, aim to satisfy enterprise and regulatory expectations around transaction-level anonymity and controlled disclosure. Critics have long pointed to XRPL’s lack of EVM-style programmability as a hindrance. The new EVM sidechain — bridged via the Axelar network — is meant to address this by letting Solidity developers tap into XRPL liquidity and identity features while accessing familiar tooling. XRP prices are down 22% over the past seven days, in line with a broader market drop.0:{"buildId":"J-5ZVPn6A93od_1TUxTCt","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985e84a51f3090f7cf87038","guid":"4e7da9bc-7ee5-4fed-a89f-747b826c9bbb","slug":"xrp-at-center-as-ripple-lays-out-institutional-defi-blueprint-for-xrpl","title":"XRP at center as Ripple lays out institutional DeFi blueprint for XRPL","link":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/06/ripple-lays-out-institutional-defi-blueprint-for-xrpl-with-xrp-at-center","pubDate":"2026-02-06T12:54:09.000Z","content":"Ripple and XRPL developers say recent mainnet upgrades and upcoming features position the XRP Ledger as a hub for regulated, real-world finance.","author":"Shaurya Malwa","enclosure":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f542c898be63947a6f84e0efbf5107286dec9a07-3840x2160.png?fm=jpg&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","source":"CoinDesk","sourceCategory":"general","category":"defi","categories":["defi","altcoins"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"XRP อยู่ในจุดสำคัญขณะที่ Ripple วางแผนธุรกิจ DeFi ระดับสถาบันสำหรับ XRPL","translatedContent":"Ripple และนักพัฒนา XRPL ระบุว่าการอัปเกรดเมนเน็ตล่าสุดและคุณสมบัติที่จะเกิดขึ้น ทำให้ XRP Ledger กลายเป็นศูนย์กลางสำหรับการเงินโลกแบบครบวงจรภายใต้การกำกับดูแล","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$4","aiSummary":"Ripple and XRPL developers are positioning the XRP Ledger as a hub for regulated, institutional DeFi by integrating compliance features directly into the protocol layer.
