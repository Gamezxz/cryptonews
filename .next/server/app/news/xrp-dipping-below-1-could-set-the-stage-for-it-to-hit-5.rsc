10:T789,Ripple’s XRP token fell to $1.22 earlier today, Feb. 6, 2026. The token last traded at this price level in November 2024, when XRP’s price was just pick up steam. 2025 was rather bullish for XRP, with prices hitting a new peak of $3.65 in July. However, the asset has been on a downtrend since its 2025 peak, especially after the October market crash. According to CoinGecko data, XRP’s price is down 7.4% in the last 24 hours , 25% in the last week, 30.6% in the 14-day charts, and 41.2% over the previous month. The current trajectory has ignited fears among investors that the popular cryptocurrency could once again dip below the $1 mark. However, dipping below $1 could set the stage for XRP to eventually breach $5. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Source: WatcherGuru The crypto market downtrend was triggered by macroeconomic uncertainties and global geopolitical tensions. However, the liquidity crunch seems to have deepened the cut. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below its 2021 all-time high and could fall below the $60,000 over the coming days. XRP’s price will likely follow BTC’s trajectory. However, BTC seems to follow a pattern of hitting new peaks after a massive pullback. The original crypto fell to $15,000 in 2022, but rose to beyond $100,000 just two years later. XRP’s price will likely follow a similar trajectory. The next bull run could push XRP price to beyond the $5 mark. Additionally, XRP also saw the launch of several spot ETFs in 2025. We could see increased ETF inflows once the bear market is over and investor sentiment returns. ETFs have played a central role in the 2025 market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) hit new peaks thanks to increased ETF inflows. XRP could see a similar pattern in the future. Also Read: How Low Can XRP Price Crash In This Cycle?
