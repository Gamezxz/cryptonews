4:Ta2f,Trading and investing platform eToro has partnered with
asset manager Amundi to launch a new investment portfolio focused on long-term
global themes.
The new product is called the Key Themes & Convictions
Portfolio. It is built using Amundi exchange-traded funds and is designed for
retail investors seeking diversified exposure to global equity markets.
The launch follows eToro’s
move last month to add 250 UCITS-structured exchange-traded funds to its
European platform. That expansion was aimed at strengthening its long-term
investment offering for retail clients. 
The additions came as European
investors continue to favor UCITS products for regulatory protection and
transparency. They also come amid rising competition from larger brokerages
offering similar ETF access.
eToro Offers Portfolio Following Global Trends
Gil Shapira, Chief Investment Officer at eToro, said
investing is about “anticipating what will shape” markets. He added that the
partnership allows users to access a portfolio that follows broad market trends
while focusing on long-term themes.
Most of the portfolio is allocated to broad equity exposure.
This allocation reflects Amundi’s strategic and tactical views on global
markets. The remaining portion is invested in selected ETFs linked to three
long-term themes identified by Amundi.
Portfolio Targets Environment, Social, Technology Themes
These themes include environment and resources, social and
demographic change, and technology. Related sub-themes cover areas such as
alternative energy, healthcare, aging populations, artificial intelligence, and
robotics.

Alongside the portfolio launch, eToro has added 120 Amundi
ETFs to its platform. These products cover multiple asset classes, including
equities, fixed income, and commodities.
Users Track Performance Through Platform Tools
The portfolio is part of eToro’s Smart Portfolios range.
These products are intended for long-term investing rather than short-term
trading. The minimum investment required is $500.
Users can track performance using eToro’s tools and charts.
Updates related to the portfolio and its underlying themes are shared through
the platform’s social feed.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
