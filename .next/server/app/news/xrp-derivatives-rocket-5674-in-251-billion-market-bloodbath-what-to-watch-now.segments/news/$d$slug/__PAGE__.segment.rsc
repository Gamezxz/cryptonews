XRP saw a significant volume surge on a major derivatives exchange, even as the broader crypto market intensified its weeklong sell-off on Friday. In the last 24 hours, $2.51 billion were liquidated in leveraged bets across the crypto market, according to CoinGlass data . A total of $2.03 billion of this figure was long positions expecting the market to rebound, while short positions accounted for $475.66 million. Amid the crash, XRP's futures volume rose 5,674% in the last 24 hours to $214.89 million on the Bitmex crypto exchange, even as the market traded lower.

What to watch now? Open interest (OI) has declined in futures tied to major cryptocurrencies, including XRP , which was down 6.57% in the last 24 hours to $2.46 billion. Crypto market sentiment has also fallen to its lowest level since the FTX collapse, as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 9, signaling "extreme fear," with traders adjusting their positioning amid the market crash. In previous cycles, extreme fear has often coincided with local bottoms, mostly because panic sentiment tends to flush out leveraged traders and short-term holders. This rebound scenario will be watched for in coming sessions.
