f:T1316,Bitwise files S-1 for spot Uniswap ETF, signaling rising institutional interest in UNI. Daily UNI token burns hit record highs as Uniswap trading fees and activity surge. UNI price drops 15% despite whale accumulation and strong on-chain fundamentals. Bitwise Investments has taken a major step toward bringing Uniswap (UNI) to the broader financial market, filing an S-1 registration with the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) for a spot Uniswap ETF. The announcement marks a potential milestone for UNI adoption in institutional portfolios, yet the token’s price still struggles. Sponsored Sponsored Bitwise Filed for a Spot Uniswap ETF as Daily UNI Burn Hits a New High Bitwise recently registered the “Bitwise Uniswap ETF” entity in Delaware, a procedural move identical to previous spot ETF filings. “With the regulatory clouds cleared and Bitwise leading the charge, $UNI is about to become a staple in every institutional portfolio,” Whale Factor remarked . The proposed fund, if approved, would track UNI’s spot price, excluding expenses, with Coinbase Custody serving as the custodian . At launch, the ETF would not include staking, signaling a straightforward exposure product for investors. The filing coincides with notable on-chain activity. Daily UNI burns have surged sharply in February, according to Dune Analytics, alongside higher Uniswap trading fees. As of early February, over 100 million UNI tokens have been burned, valued at approximately $597 million, with the annualized burn rate exceeding $36 million. Daily UNI Burns. Source: Dune Analytics Sponsored Sponsored Daily charts indicate that the pace of UNI burning is accelerating, reflecting strong trading activity and the impact of the protocol’s Fee Switch, which converts a portion of trading fees into burned UNI. Uniswap Daily Fees. Source: Dune Analytics Despite these metrics, UNI’s price has remained relatively subdued, down by almost 15% over the last 24 hours. As of this writing, the UNI token was trading at $3.20, down 13.73% amid broader market bearish sentiment. Uniswap (UNI) Price Performance. Source: BeInCrypto Sponsored Sponsored Whales Accumulate UNI Amid Fee Switch Uncertainty and Rising Exchange Flows Notwithstanding, on-chain data shows that large investors are strategically accumulating the token. Lookonchain reported that whale address 0x9671 sold 242 XAUT ($1.19 million) and 461 ETH ($985,000) to purchase 682,087 UNI worth $2.58 million. This highlights confidence in UNI’s medium-term upside. However, analysts remain divided on whether the Fee Switch’s early performance justifies optimism. BeInCrypto reported in December that initial revenue from the Fee Switch fell short of governance expectations , with some analysts questioning whether the early data reflects flawed assumptions or simply incomplete rollout effects. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams cautioned that “conclusions are premature and based on misleading assumptions,” suggesting the protocol’s long-term revenue potential may not yet be fully realized. Nah the analysis is just wrong, overeager and misleading 1) treasury burned uni approx equal to what would have been the case if it had been on the whole time 2) only a subset of fee sources have turned on so far. Also lots of parameters that can be tuned in future proposals… — Hayden Adams 🦄 (@haydenzadams) December 29, 2025 Sponsored Sponsored At the same time, the amount of UNI flowing to exchanges continues to rise, signaling potential selling pressure. CryptoQuant data shows that Uniswap reserves on exchanges have climbed, raising concerns that price support could be tested if selling intensifies. Uniswap Reserves on Exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant Historical trends illustrate that higher exchange inflows often precede short-term volatility, even amid strong protocol fundamentals. Overall, the Bitwise spot Uniswap ETF filing and the accelerating UNI burn indicate growing institutional interest and protocol activity. While on-chain metrics signal strong engagement and active fee generation, market forces, such as increased UNI inflows to exchanges and ongoing price weakness, suggest volatility could remain elevated in the near term. As the SEC reviews the ETF application, investors will be watching closely to see if this product opens the door for wider mainstream adoption of UNI, potentially providing a bridge between DeFi liquidity and traditional capital markets.

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the BTC held by these ETFs has only decreased by approximately 7%, from 1.362 million to 1.272 million BTC. Global BTC ETF holdings showed similar strength, dropping by just 4.8% from 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC over the same period, indicating that investors, primarily 'boomers', are holding firm despite market volatility.

Bitcoin recently fell to $60K for the first time since October 2024, though it slightly recovered to $65K at press time. While BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced a record trading volume of $10 billion alongside a 13% price drop, analysts are divided about whether the market has reached its bottom. Chris Burniske expects further downside to levels around $58K or $50K, while Bitfinex analysts suggest that without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any upward movement might only represent a lower high in a fragile market.11:Taef,กองทุน Bitcoin ETF ในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้แสดงความยืดหยุ่นอย่างน่าทึ่งแม้ในช่วงที่ราคา Bitcoin ลดลงกว่า 50% ตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2025 ตามที่ Eric Balchunas นักวิเคราะห์ ETF จาก Bloomberg ระบุ ปริมาณ Bitcoin ที่ถือโดยกองทุนเหล่านี้ลดลงเพียงประมาณ 7% เท่านั้น จาก 1.362 ล้านเหรียญเป็น 1.272 ล้านเหรียญ การถือครอง Bitcoin ETF ทั่วโลกก็แสดงความแข็งแกร่งในทำนองเดียวกัน โดยลดลงเพียง 4.8% จาก 1.50 ล้านเป็น 1.428 ล้านเหรียญ ซึ่งชี้ให้เห็นว่านักลงทุน ส่วนใหญ่เป็น "ผู้สูงอายุ" ยังคงถือหุ้นอย่างมั่นคงแม้ในช่วงที่ตลาดผันผวน

Bitcoin เพิ่งลดลงสู่ระดับ $60K เป็นครั้งแรกนับตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2024 แม้ว่าจะฟื้นตัวกลับมาเล็กน้อยสู่ระดับ $65K ในขณะที่เขียนข่าว แม้ว่ากองทุน Bitcoin ETF ของ BlackRock จะมีมูลค่าการซื้อขายสูงสุดในรอบวันที่ $10 พันล้าน พร้อมกับการลดราคา 13% นักวิเคราะห์ยังคงแบ่งความเห็นเกี่ยวกับว่าตลาดได้ผ่านจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือไม่ Chris Burniske คาดการณ์ว่าจะมีการปรับตัวลดลงต่อไปยังระดับประมาณ $58K หรือ $50K ในขณะที่นักวิเคราะห์จาก Bitfinex ชี้ให้เห็นว่าหากไม่มีความต้องการในการซื้อขายและกระแสเงินทุนจากกองทุน ETF ที่แข็งแกร่งขึ้น การเคลื่อนไหวขาขึ้นใดๆ อาจเป็นเพียงจุดสูงสุดที่ต่ำกว่าในตลาดที่อ่อนแอ12:Tb48,Journalist Posted: February 6, 2026 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively resilient despite the crypto asset’s +50% price decline. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the overall BTC held by the ETFs dropped by only about 7%. He viewed the holders, mainly boomers, as ‘diamond hands.’ “Bitcoin’s price is down 44% from October high, but the amount of BTC held by the ETFs is only down 6.6%. Boomer strong.” Source: X Before the October crash, the U.S spot BTC ETFs held a record high of 1.362 million BTC. This stash had since dropped to 1.272 million BTC by the 4th of February. Can ETFs withstand the pressure? When zoomed out to the global holdings of BTC ETFs (covering offerings in the U.S, E.U., Asia, and others), the same picture emerged. Over the same period, global BTC ETF holdings dropped by only 72,400 BTC from October’s high of 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC. That’s only a 4.8% drop in BTC holdings. Source: BOLD report Put differently, the market fears and outflows in the past few weeks have not led to a massive drop in BTC held by ETFs. However, the asset extended its price decline over the past 24 hours, tagging $60K for the first time since October 2024. Although BTC price had moved up slightly to $65K at press time, there was still uncertainty about whether it had reached its final market bottom. Source: Bloomberg That said, the latest dump saw BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) post its record daily trading volume of $10 billion and its second-worst price drop 13%. For Balchunas , this was ‘brutal,’ further raising questions about the ETF buyers’ ability to remain resilient if markets go lower. Is $60K the market bottom? Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a VC partner at Placeholder and former Ark Invest crypto lead, said the sub-$60K levels were of ‘interest’ but expected an extra downside. “Watching with interest, but not buying yet. Expect a bounce, but doubt the bloodletting is done.” Chris nailed the October market top and the ensuing drawdown. He had projected that the market could bottom near $58K or $50K (levels that aligned with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and on-chain cost basis. For their part, Bitfinex analysts appeared hopeful that the market was not in a better position to form a bottom after the price dropped below the previous cycle peak of $69K. But they also echoed Burniske’s caution, “Order books show most demand under $66k as support bids were hit or pulled. That can set up a relief bounce, but without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any move risks being just a lower high in a fragile market.” Source: Bitfinex Final Thoughts BTC held by U.S spot ETFs has dropped by only 7% despite BTC’s +50% price decline since October 2025 Despite the extended dip to $60K-$65K zone, analysts appeared cautiously optimistic for a potential BTC bottom.13:Tc01,In brief Polymarket has filed U.S. trademark applications for POLY and $POLY tied to digital token and crypto trading services. Executives previously confirmed plans to Decrypt for a POLY token and a possible airdrop focused on “true utility.” The move comes as Polymarket faces fresh legal challenges, with traders seeing low odds of a token launch before May. Polymarket has filed trademark applications for " POLY " and " $POLY " with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, signaling concrete steps toward launching its long-anticipated native token , even as the prediction market faces mounting regulatory challenges. The filings, submitted Thursday by Polymarket's parent company Blockratize Inc., cover trademark protection for “cryptocurrency services, financial trading platforms, and blockchain-based payment systems.” Both applications describe services for "providing a digital currency or digital token for use by members of an on-line community via a global computer network" and list cryptocurrency trading, financial exchange services, and portfolio management among their intended uses. Polymarket’s token plans The trademark applications offer the first formal public paper trail tied to Polymarket’s token plans. Polymarket CMO Matthew Modabber confirmed plans for a POLY token and airdrop in October, telling Degenz Live, a show from Decrypt's sister company, Rug Radio, that the company wants the token to have "true utility" and "longevity." CEO Shayne Coplan teased the token in October by tweeting a "POLY" ticker alongside Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and BNB . Sources familiar with the matter previously told Decrypt that Polymarket does not plan to launch its token until it has regained a foothold in the U.S. market. The company moved closer to that goal in November, when it received CFTC approval to operate domestically, nearly four years after paying a $1.4 million fine and exiting the U.S. market. On prediction market Myriad , owned by Decrypt ’s parent company Dastan, users place just a 30% chance on Polymarket announcing its token before May. Prediction markets face challenges The trademark filings come at a critical juncture for Polymarket as it treads through U.S. market reentry while facing state-level legal challenges that threaten its core business model. But the path forward has grown more complicated as, most recently, the Nevada state court issued a temporary restraining order blocking Polymarket from offering event-based contracts in the state, finding its activities likely violate Nevada gaming law. The platform subsequently removed the case to federal court, claiming the state action conflicts with federal law, according to Daniel Wallach, founder and principal of Wallach Legal LLC, a law firm specializing in sports wagering and gaming law. The trademark applications await examination by the USPTO. Polymarket did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.
