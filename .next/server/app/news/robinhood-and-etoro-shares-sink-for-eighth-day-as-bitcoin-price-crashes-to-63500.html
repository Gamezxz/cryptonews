We start with Dor’s reaction to the Summit and then move to broker growth and the quick wins brokers often overlook. Dor shares where he sees “blue ocean” growth across Asian markets and how local client behaviour shapes demand. We also discuss the rollout of AI across investment research. Dor gives real examples of how automation and human judgment meet at Bridgewise — including moments when analysts corrected AI output, and times when AI prevented an error. We close with a practical question: how retail investors can actually use AI without falling into common traps.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.

traded retail trading platforms heavily reliant on cryptocurrency\ntrading revenue saw their stock prices continue a sharp descent today (Thursday),\nwith Robinhood and eToro each extending multi-session losing streaks as Bitcoin\ncrashed to its lowest level since October 2024.\nHOOD closed\nat $75.67 on Thursday, marking its eighth consecutive day of losses and\nrepresenting a decline of nearly 10% for the session. The stock hit its lowest\nlevel since June 2025, with the extended selloff erasing gains accumulated\nduring the late-2025 crypto market rally.\nETOR fared\nsimilarly, dropping approximately 7% Thursday to close just below $26.54 in its\nseventh straight losing session. The Israeli-founded trading platform, which\ndebuted on Nasdaq in May 2025 at $69, has now shed more than 60% of its value\nsince its public market launch.\nBitcoin Plunges in\nSharpest Single-Day Drop in Over a Year\nThe stock\ndeclines tracked Bitcoin's dramatic collapse Thursday, with the cryptocurrency\nfalling to $63,500 during the session, marking its lowest point since October\n2024. The selloff accelerated throughout the day, with Bitcoin ultimately\ndropping more than 13% in one of its sharpest single-day percentage declines in\nat least 15 months.\nThe broader\ncrypto market capitalization fell 6.4% in 24 hours to $2.49 trillion, with 92\nof the top 100 digital assets posting losses. Bitcoin has now dropped 44% from\nits October peak, erasing more than $800 billion in market value.\nThe selloff\nextended to Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, which fell more\nthan 13% Thursday to close around $152.44, testing levels not seen since April\n2025. Coinbase marked its eighth consecutive session in the red, directly\ntracking the cryptocurrency market's steep decline.\nRevenue Concentration\nCreates Vulnerability\nThe three\nplatforms share a common weakness: substantial dependence on cryptocurrency\ntrading for revenue generation. eToro's crypto\nreliance proved particularly acute in recent quarters, with digital assets contributing 91% of total\nrevenue in Q2 2025 when crypto markets surged. \nFor the\nfull year 2024, cryptoassets accounted for almost 40% of eToro's $931 million\nin commission revenue, though the company's crypto dependency fluctuates\ndramatically with market conditions.\n“For\nmany investors, shares of companies like eToro and Robinhood are indirect\nexposure to cryptocurrencies on the stock market, and the strong dependence of\ntheir financial results on the fate of cryptocurrencies means that we are\nwitnessing situations like this,” Arkadiusz Jóźwiak, analyst and crypto\neducator from Comparic.pl, explained to FinanceMagnates.com. \nRobinhood\nshowed somewhat more diversification but still faces significant crypto\nexposure. Cryptocurrency revenue reached $268 million in Q3 2025, representing\napproximately 20% of the company's $1.27 billion total revenue, with a 339%\nyear-over-year increase. \nThe platform's\nchief investment officer recently warned that retail net buying activity has\nslowed following a late October surge, raising concerns about sustained trading\nvolumes.\nBull Market Boom Now\nReversing\nBoth\nplatforms experienced explosive crypto revenue growth during 2024's digital\nasset rally. eToro's commission revenue jumped 48% year-over-year in 2024, with\nover 25% of that growth concentrated in Q4 alone as Bitcoin surged. Net profit\nskyrocketed to $192 million from just $15.3 million in 2023, driven primarily\nby crypto trading activity.\nRobinhood's\nQ4 2024 cryptocurrency revenue of $358 million represented a 700%\nyear-over-year increase, surpassing options trading revenue for the first time\nin company history. For full-year 2024, Robinhood generated $2.95 billion in\ntotal revenue, up 58%, with crypto contributing 21%.\n“When\nBitcoin rises, everyone is happy and company shares also rise, but when it\nfalls, sentiment automatically changes. It is not certain that if Bitcoin\ncontinues to fall, Robinhood and eToro will not follow it further down,”\nJóźwiak added.\n\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Damian Chmiel at www.financemagnates.com."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T6f2f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 Executive Interview | Dor Eligula | Co-Founder \u0026 Chief Business Officer, BridgeWise | FMLS:25 In this session, Jonathan Fine form Ultimate Group speaks with Dor Eligula from Bridgewise, a fast-growing AI-powered research and analytics firm supporting brokers and exchanges worldwide.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
