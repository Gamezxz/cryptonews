4:T103f,Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure Metaplanet is pressing ahead with its plan to buy more Bitcoin even as the broader crypto market turns sour. Reports say the Tokyo-listed firm is keeping its target goals and moving to raise cash to support further purchases, a bet that has left the company with big paper losses but a steady, public commitment to its strategy. Metaplanet Commits To Bigger Bitcoin Hoard According to recent coverage, Metaplanet wants to grow its stash to far larger levels over the next year, with long-range figures aimed at reaching 100,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2026 and 210,000 by 2027, under what has been called the “555 Million Plan.” “There has been no shift in Metaplanet’s approach. We plan to keep adding Bitcoin at a steady pace, grow our revenue streams, and get ready for the next stage of growth,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich wrote on X on Friday, based on a machine-translated version of the post. The company has also opened financing channels to help fund buys, including a stock offering that was announced to support staged purchases rather than a single big trade. おはプラネット。最近の株価動向を踏まえ、株主の皆さまにとって厳しい状況が続いていることは、私たちも十分に認識しています。しかしながら、メタプラネットの戦略に変更はありません。私たちは引き続き、ビットコインの積み上げ、収益の拡大、そして次の成長フェーズに向けた準備を、着実に進めてい… — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) February 6, 2026 Market Gloom And Heavy Paper Losses Reports note that the recent slump in Bitcoin prices has hammered firms that use the coin as their main reserve asset. Metaplanet’s share price has slid, mirroring a wider selloff in corporate Bitcoin treasuries, and investor mood has turned cautious as unrealized impairments mount. The wider market wobble has pushed some treasury companies to report deep impairments and to rethink near-term funding moves. CEO Reaffirms Buying Plan Reports say Metaplanet’s chief executive has publicly stated there is no change to the buying policy and that the firm will steadily keep adding BTC. The message was posted on social channels and translated for local media, where the CEO stressed that accumulation will continue alongside efforts to expand revenue sources. That comment came amid heavy volatility and concerns about how long the downturn might last. BTCUSD currently trading at $69,610. Chart: TradingView Bitcoin Price Action In The Middle Of The Story Bitcoin itself has been volatile this week. The token traded below recent highs before recovering some ground, and the quick moves have amplified unrealized gains and losses across corporate balance sheets. The market has swung hard, creating days when billions of dollars were wiped from prices and other days when a modest rebound pushed values back up. Impairment And Funding Moves Based on reports, Metaplanet recorded a substantial non-cash impairment tied to its Bitcoin holdings, a figure roughly in the hundreds of millions of dollars that trimmed reported earnings for the year. At the same time, management has put in place capital-raising steps — including equity issuance — aimed at giving the company the firepower to buy in stages and support operations while prices remain rocky.
