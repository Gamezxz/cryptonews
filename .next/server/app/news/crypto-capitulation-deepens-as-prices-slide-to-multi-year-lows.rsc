f:T7ec,A wave of forced liquidations, ETF outflows, and collapsing miner economics pushed crypto sentiment to its darkest levels since 2022 as markets hunt for a bottom. Posted February 6, 2026 at 7:40 am EST. Crypto markets extended last week’s selloff into a full-blown capitulation, with sentiment hitting levels last seen during the 2022 collapse. As of 5:50 am ET , bitcoin was trading near $65,900 , after briefly plunging toward $60,000 , while ether fell to $1,920 and solana slid to $81 . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to 9 out of 100 , its lowest reading since the Terra meltdown. This story is an excerpt from the Unchained Daily newsletter . Subscribe here to get these updates in your email for free The damage has been broad and mechanical. Over the past 24 hours alone, roughly $2.6 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, the majority tied to long bets. Bitcoin also slipped below its 200-week exponential moving average , a level historically breached only during deep bear markets. From its October peak near $126,000, BTC is now down close to 50% . ETF flows reflect the stress. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs posted $434 million in net outflows on Feb. 5, led by $175 million exiting BlackRock’s IBIT , even as the fund saw a record $10 billion in daily trading volume . Ether ETFs lost another $81 million , while solana ETFs bucked the trend with modest inflows. Trading activity has surged amid the chaos. Perpetual DEXs recorded over $70 billion in daily volume , the second-highest day on record, trailing only the October 10 flash crash. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap has fallen to roughly $2.3 trillion , with more than $1 trillion erased since mid-January. Pressure is also mounting beneath the surface. Bitcoin mining profitability has collapsed, with hash price falling to a record low near $0.03 per terahash , squeezing miners already facing higher power costs. Together, the data paints a picture of forced selling, thin liquidity, and a market still searching for a durable floor.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"698640084007f0a6ec7f19b7","guid":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/?p=40705","slug":"crypto-capitulation-deepens-as-prices-slide-to-multi-year-lows","title":"Crypto Capitulation Deepens as Prices Slide to Multi-Year Lows","link":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/crypto-capitulation-accelerates-as-2-6-billion-in-liquidations-rock-markets/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T12:40:11.000Z","content":"The post Crypto Capitulation Deepens as Prices Slide to Multi-Year Lows appeared first on Unchained.","author":"Editorial","enclosure":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fear-and-Greed-index.png","source":"Unchained","sourceCategory":"general","category":"general","categories":["general"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"การขายถอดคริปโตรุนแรงขึ้นเมื่อราคาจมลงสู่จุดต่ำสุดในรอบหลายปี","translatedContent":"โพสต์ที่มีหัวข้อว่า การขายถอดคริปโตรุนแรงขึ้นเมื่อราคาจมลงสู่จุดต่ำสุดในรอบหลายปี ปรากฏขึ้นเป็นครั้งแรกที่ Unchained","sentiment":"bearish","fullContent":"$f","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":343,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.989Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.989Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T01:05:15.060Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69868fca38f2116917d5f468","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T01:01:11.000Z","slug":"edward-woodford-the-crypto-industry-is-overly-focused-on-interest-rates-accounta","source":"Crypto Briefing","title":"Edward Woodford: The crypto industry is overly focused on interest rates, accountability in AI is crucial for trust, and regulatory clarity is essential for market stability | Unchained","translatedTitle":"เอ็ดเวิร์ด วูดฟอร์ด: อุตสาหกรรมคริปโต้เนอะเกินไปกับอัตราดอกเบี้ย ความรับผิดชอบของ AI เป็นสิ่งสำคัญสำหรับความไว้วางใจ และความชัดเจนทางกฎหมายสำครับความมั่นคงของตลาด | Unchained"},{"_id":"6986879638f2116917d59ab8","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:25:00.000Z","slug":"krakens-big-hint-pi-coin-set-for-exchange-listing-in-2026","source":"DailyCoin","title":"Kraken’s Big Hint: Pi Coin Set for Exchange Listing In 2026","translatedTitle":"Kraken บอกเบาะแส: Pi Coin กำลังจะมีการลงตลาดบน Kraken ในปี 2026"},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c34","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:00:02.000Z","slug":"chainlink-are-investors-buying-the-fear-amid-links-12-drop","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"Chainlink: Are investors buying the fear amid LINK’s 12% drop?","translatedTitle":"Chainlink: นักลงทุนกำลังซื้อในช่วงที่กังวลไปกับการลดลง 12% ของ LINK?"},{"_id":"6986772e38f2116917d4bcb0","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-06T23:17:38.000Z","slug":"why-crypto-is-down-and-when-it-might-bottom-insights-from-bitwises-matt-hougan","source":"Crypto.news","title":"Why crypto is down and when it might bottom: Insights from Bitwise’s Matt Hougan","translatedTitle":"ทำไม Crypto ถึงถอยและจะจอดตัวต่ำเมื่อไหร่: ข้อมูลเชิงลึกจาก Matt Hougan ของ Bitwise"}]}],"$L10"]
