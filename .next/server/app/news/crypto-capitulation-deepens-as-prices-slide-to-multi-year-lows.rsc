10:T7ec,A wave of forced liquidations, ETF outflows, and collapsing miner economics pushed crypto sentiment to its darkest levels since 2022 as markets hunt for a bottom. Posted February 6, 2026 at 7:40 am EST. Crypto markets extended last week’s selloff into a full-blown capitulation, with sentiment hitting levels last seen during the 2022 collapse. As of 5:50 am ET , bitcoin was trading near $65,900 , after briefly plunging toward $60,000 , while ether fell to $1,920 and solana slid to $81 . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to 9 out of 100 , its lowest reading since the Terra meltdown. This story is an excerpt from the Unchained Daily newsletter . Subscribe here to get these updates in your email for free The damage has been broad and mechanical. Over the past 24 hours alone, roughly $2.6 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, the majority tied to long bets. Bitcoin also slipped below its 200-week exponential moving average , a level historically breached only during deep bear markets. From its October peak near $126,000, BTC is now down close to 50% . ETF flows reflect the stress. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs posted $434 million in net outflows on Feb. 5, led by $175 million exiting BlackRock’s IBIT , even as the fund saw a record $10 billion in daily trading volume . Ether ETFs lost another $81 million , while solana ETFs bucked the trend with modest inflows. Trading activity has surged amid the chaos. Perpetual DEXs recorded over $70 billion in daily volume , the second-highest day on record, trailing only the October 10 flash crash. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap has fallen to roughly $2.3 trillion , with more than $1 trillion erased since mid-January. Pressure is also mounting beneath the surface. Bitcoin mining profitability has collapsed, with hash price falling to a record low near $0.03 per terahash , squeezing miners already facing higher power costs. Together, the data paints a picture of forced selling, thin liquidity, and a market still searching for a durable floor.5:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"_id":"698640084007f0a6ec7f19b7","guid":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/?p=40705","slug":"crypto-capitulation-deepens-as-prices-slide-to-multi-year-lows","title":"Crypto Capitulation Deepens as Prices Slide to Multi-Year Lows","link":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/crypto-capitulation-accelerates-as-2-6-billion-in-liquidations-rock-markets/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T12:40:11.000Z","content":"The post Crypto Capitulation Deepens as Prices Slide to Multi-Year Lows appeared first on Unchained.","author":"Editorial","enclosure":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fear-and-Greed-index.png","source":"Unchained","sourceCategory":"general","category":"general","categories":["general"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"การขายถอดคริปโตรุนแรงขึ้นเมื่อราคาจมลงสู่จุดต่ำสุดในรอบหลายปี","translatedContent":"โพสต์ที่มีหัวข้อว่า การขายถอดคริปโตรุนแรงขึ้นเมื่อราคาจมลงสู่จุดต่ำสุดในรอบหลายปี ปรากฏขึ้นเป็นครั้งแรกที่ Unchained","sentiment":"bearish","fullContent":"$10","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":343,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.989Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.989Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T05:50:19.083Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986cb9038f2116917d85623","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:17:35.000Z","slug":"hyperliquid-price-prediction-2026-2027-2030-will-hype-price-hit-a-new-ath","source":"Coinpedia","title":"Hyperliquid Price Prediction 2026, 2027 – 2030: Will HYPE Price Hit A New ATH?","translatedTitle":"คาดการณ์ราคา Hyperliquid 2026, 2027 – 2030: ราคา HYPE จะทะลุขีดจำกัดใหม่ได้ไหม?"},{"_id":"6986c80a38f2116917d8356e","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:47.000Z","slug":"pi-coin-price-prediction-what-next-after-altcoin-rejects-0190-retest","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"Pi coin price prediction – What next after altcoin rejects $0.190 retest?","translatedTitle":"คาดการณ์ราคะเหรียญ Pi - จะเกิดอะไรขึ้นหลังจากเหรียญอัลติคอยน์ปฏิเสธการทดสอบราคาที่ $0.190 อีกครั้ง?"},{"_id":"6986cde738f2116917d86b48","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:00:01.000Z","slug":"crypto-firms-raise-258m-despite-2-trillion-market-drawdown","source":"DL News","title":"Crypto firms raise $258m despite $2 trillion market drawdown ","translatedTitle":"บริษัทคริปโตระดมทุน 258 ล้านดอลลาร์ แม้ตลาดสูญเสีย 2 ล้านล้านดอลลาร์"},{"_id":"6986b9fb38f2116917d7aaf3","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-07T04:00:36.000Z","slug":"fartcoin-how-648m-whale-sell-off-hurt-the-memecoins-price","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"FARTCOIN: How $64.8M whale sell-off hurt the memecoin’s price","translatedTitle":"FARTCOIN: การขายครึ่งแสนล้านของ Whale ทำให้ราคา memecoin ตกลง"}]}],"$L11"]
