4:T1846,Small businesses are gaining new tools to compete as Loyyal rolls out Perxi AI, promising to reshape how loyalty programs are created and managed. Summary Loyyal introduces an AI loyalty agent for messaging apps Removing cost and complexity for SME loyalty programs WhatsApp-first design and frictionless participation Driving retention, personalization, and smarter decisions From loyalty management to broader AI-powered operations Award recognition and technology foundation About Loyyal and its loyalty ecosystem Loyyal introduces an AI loyalty agent for messaging apps On Feb. 6, 2026 in Dubai , enterprise SaaS provider Loyyal announced the launch of Perxi AI , described as the world’s first AI Agent of Loyalty. The platform is designed to let small and medium businesses (SMEs) instantly create and run branded loyalty programs directly within messaging channels, starting with WhatsApp . Unlike traditional software-heavy systems, Perxi AI operates as a conversational assistant embedded in existing chat apps. Moreover, it targets SMEs that have historically lacked access to advanced retention technology due to setup complexity and budget constraints. Removing cost and complexity for SME loyalty programs For years, many SMEs avoided loyalty initiatives because of expensive software licenses, long commercial commitments, and the need for specialist staff and training. That said, these barriers allowed only major corporations to deploy sophisticated but high value customer retention tools, leaving smaller players at a disadvantage. Perxi AI is built to eliminate these hurdles through an instant loyalty launch model. SMEs can rapidly set up and manage their programs without upfront fees, turning deployment into a simple chat-based interaction instead of an IT project. The entire system runs through familiar social channels. In particular, its WhatsApp chat interface is optimized to feel like conversing with a friend, guiding business owners step by step as they configure rewards, rules, and customer engagement flows. WhatsApp-first design and frictionless participation Neither the business nor its customers are required to download an extra app, which is a common source of friction in loyalty participation. Instead, all management tasks and customer touchpoints occur inside the existing WhatsApp environment, where users already spend significant time each day. Moreover, Perxi AI supports interaction in any language, enabling both merchants and customers across the globe to communicate in their preferred tongue. This multi language capability allows highly localized yet scalable experiences, which is crucial for SMEs operating in diverse markets. Driving retention, personalization, and smarter decisions The new platform is positioned as a way to transform an SME’s competitive posture. By automating core loyalty mechanics, it helps merchants secure repeat business, while allowing them to deliver more personalized experiences tailored to customer purchase patterns and preferences. Beyond simple point collection, Perxi AI provides data-driven insights and analytics dashboards. However, instead of forcing owners to learn complex tools, the agent surfaces key metrics through chat, helping them understand customer behavior and the effectiveness of campaigns in everyday language. Another strategic pillar is ecosystem integration. Through Loyyal’s marketplace, small businesses can plug into larger loyalty programs and cross-partner networks. This ecosystem access significantly expands their potential reach and can enhance the value of their own rewards by connecting to broader experiences. From loyalty management to broader AI-powered operations Loyyal is positioning Perxi AI as more than a loyalty chatbot over the long term. The roadmap includes a dedicated finance module that will sit inside the same conversational interface. In future phases, SMEs will be able to access functions such as business finance management and credit lending workflows directly in chat. Moreover, this expansion suggests a gradual evolution from a pure loyalty solution into a broader ai loyalty platform supporting everyday operational decisions. By keeping everything in a single interface, Loyyal aims to reduce the fragmentation typical of small business software stacks. Award recognition and technology foundation Perxi AI secured a key validation milestone by winning the META Llama AI Startupbootcap Program 2025 . This recognition underscores that the product draws on state-of-the- art conversational AI models, tailored for high-frequency interactions between merchants and consumers. According to Ashish Kumar Singh , CEO at Perxi AI & Loyyal, the goal is to shift the competitive balance between small firms and large enterprises. He noted that by anchoring loyalty management in WhatsApp, the company enables small business owners to deploy hyper personalized retention tools that once required a full corporate team. Furthermore, Singh emphasized that loyalty is becoming universally accessible, intelligent, and simple, aligning with Loyyal’s broader strategy to apply AI and Web3 to next-generation customer engagement. About Loyyal and its loyalty ecosystem Loyyal operates as an enterprise SaaS development firm focused on loyalty and payments, built on patented blockchain infrastructure. Its technology is designed to convert traditional loyalty programs from cost centers into profit-generating ecosystems for brands and partners. The company’s product suite includes Access Point , Reward Point , Xpand Point , and Perk Point , alongside Perxi AI.
