10:T416,Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported a staggering $12.6 billion quarterly loss, primarily due to unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings as the cryptocurrency's price fell below the company's average acquisition cost. The sharp Bitcoin decline from approximately $73,100 to $62,400 during the quarter erased what were recently more than $30 billion in paper profits, highlighting the deep connection between the company's financial performance and crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business.

As the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with over 713,000 BTC, Strategy's stock has plummeted over 70% in the past year. Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor maintains a "HODL" strategy, while other companies like BitMine face similar unrealized losses on their Ethereum holdings. Analysts remind that Bitcoin's volatility is characteristic of its history, and long-term investors continue to focus on scarcity and long-term growth potential despite short-term price fluctuations.11:Tac0,บริษัท Strategy (เดิมชื่อ MicroStrategy) รายงานขาดทุนไตรมาสที่น่าตกใจมูลค่า 12.6 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่มาจากขาดทุนที่ยังไม่เกิดขึ้นจริงในสินทรัพย์ Bitcoin เนื่องจากราคาสกุลเงินดิจิทัลลดลงต่ำกว่าราคาซื้อเฉลี่ยของบริษัท การร่วงลงของ Bitcoin จากระดับประมาณ 73,100 ดอลลาร์เป็น 62,400 ดอลลาร์ในไตรมาสนี้ ทำให้กำไรบนกระดาษที่เคยมีมากกว่า 30 พันล้านดอลลาร์เมื่อเร็วๆ นี้หายไป ซึ่งสะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความสัมพันธ์ที่ลึกซึ้งระหว่างผลการดำเนินงานทางการเงินของบริษัทกับการเคลื่อนไหวของตลาดคริปโตมากกว่าธุรกิจซอฟต์แวร์พื้นฐาน

The hit was driven almost entirely by unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings, underscoring how deeply the firm’s balance sheet is tied to crypto market movements rather than its underlying software business. Crypto Market Crash Erases Billions in Paper Gains The loss followed one of Bitcoin’s sharpest drawdowns in recent history . During the quarter, Bitcoin plunged nearly 15% intraday, sliding from around $73,100 to a low of $62,400. This move pushed Bitcoin below Strategy’s average acquisition price of roughly $76,000, flipping the firm’s position from massive unrealized gains into deep losses. Just a few months earlier, Strategy was sitting on more than $30 billion in paper profits when Bitcoin surged to record highs. Strategy Stock Feels the Pressure The market reaction was swift. Strategy shares dropped sharply after the earnings release and continued falling in after-hours trading. Over the past year, the stock has been down more than 70%, erasing much of the premium investors once assigned to the company’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since its November 2024 peak, the stock is now down nearly 80%, highlighting how quickly sentiment has turned. Bitcoin Exposure Magnifies Financial Impact Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, with more than 713,000 BTC on its balance sheet as of early February. Much of this position was accumulated during the late-2024 bull run, when Bitcoin briefly climbed above $120,000. With prices now well below those levels, unrealized losses have ballooned, making quarterly results highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s volatility. Saylor Stays Defiant as Critics Circle Despite the historic loss, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor showed no sign of wavering, posting a brief “HODL” message on X. However, critics have grown louder. Investors like Michael Burry have warned that sustained declines in Bitcoin could trigger cascading losses for corporate holders, reviving long-standing concerns around leverage and exposure to non-yielding assets. Ethereum Slide Hits BitMine Too Strategy is not alone. BitMine Immersion Technologies is facing roughly $8.2 billion in unrealized losses after Ethereum slipped to around $1,930, well below its average purchase price of $3,826. The company holds about 4.29 million ETH but has cushioned the blow by staking over 2.9 million ETH, generating around $188 million in annual yield, while maintaining strong cash reserves and no debt. Volatility, Not Failure Amid the turmoil, Anthony Pompliano offered a broader perspective, arguing that Bitcoin’s volatility is a feature, not a flaw. He pointed out that repeated 50–85% drawdowns have defined Bitcoin’s history, yet the network has continued to operate flawlessly for over a decade. While critics celebrate downturns, long-term holders remain focused on scarcity, betting that short-term pain is temporary in Bitcoin’s long-term growth story. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own, and why does it matter? MicroStrategy holds over 713,000 Bitcoin, making it the world’s largest corporate holder. This massive stake makes its financial results extremely sensitive to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Did MicroStrategy sell its Bitcoin after the loss? No. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor signaled a continued “HODL” strategy, indicating the company does not plan to sell its Bitcoin despite the paper losses. Are other companies facing similar crypto losses? Yes. For example, BitMine faces about $8.2 billion in unrealized losses on its Ethereum holdings, though it offsets some risk through staking rewards and strong cash reserves. Is Bitcoin’s volatility a sign it’s failing? No. Analysts note Bitcoin’s history is defined by large drawdowns, yet the network operates flawlessly. Long-term investors view volatility as a temporary feature of its long-term growth story.

That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

Bitcoin price dropped nearly 8.6%, hovering near the $65,000 level, while Ethereum and major altcoins followed with sharp intraday losses. The intensity of the move points to more than routine profit-taking. With liquidations accelerating and sentiment collapsing into extreme fear, the ongoing crypto crash creates a dilemma among investors, one that forces traders and investors to confront a familiar question: Is this a buy-the-dip moment, or is patience still required? Liquidations Data Reveals Market Still Under Stress The key trigger of today’s crypto crash lies in derivatives data. More than $2.59 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most aggressive leverage flushes of the year. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the bulk of forced closures, while altcoins experienced cascading liquidations as price levels failed in quick succession. At the same time, total open interest fell 10.1% to $95.77 billion, confirming that leverage is being removed, not repositioned. Such conditions typically reflect instability rather than balance. Markets tend to struggle to form durable bottoms while liquidation velocity remains elevated. Sentiment Hits Extreme Fear, But Capitulation Is Incomplete The Crypto market Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, placing sentiment deep into Extreme Fear, a zone that historically precedes medium-term recoveries. However, structural signals remain mixed. Bitcoin exchange balances increased by 13,800 BTC, suggesting that selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself. Coins are still moving toward exchanges rather than being locked away by long-term holders. In previous market cycles, sustainable bottoms emerged after extreme fear persisted alongside declining exchange inflows, a condition that has not yet fully materialized. Bitcoin Price at $65K: A Decision Zone, Not a Confirmed Bottom Bitcoin’s drop toward the $65,000 region is now colliding with a signal that long-term market participants rarely ignore. The monthly stochastic oscillator has slipped into extreme oversold territory, a condition that has appeared only three times over the past decade. Each prior occurrence aligned with major bear market bottoms and the start of prolonged accumulation phases. However, history also shows this signal is not a timing trigger. In previous cycles, Bitcoin did not immediately reverse higher. Instead, price often spent weeks sometimes months moving sideways or making marginal new lows as leverage flushed out and sentiment reset. That dynamic matters today. While the long-term stochastic suggests downside may be structurally limited, short-term data still reflects stress. Open interest is falling, liquidations remain elevated, and exchange balances are rising, indicating that traders are still de-risking rather than rebuilding positions. In practical terms, this creates a split narrative. For long-horizon investors, conditions are beginning to resemble early accumulation zones. For short-term traders, volatility risk remains high until liquidation pressure eases and price stabilizes above key support. The signal argues that Bitcoin may be closer to a bottom than a top, but confirmation will require patience, not prediction. Final Thoughts: Right Time to Buy or Wait? The broader crypto market is showing classic stress signals, not clear bottoming behavior. Extreme fear readings, multi-billion-dollar liquidations, and declining open interest suggest forced deleveraging is still working its way through the system. While some assets are showing relative strength and selective accumulation, this looks more like rotation and positioning not a broad-based recovery. Historically, durable market bottoms form after volatility compresses and sellers exhaust, not during peak liquidation phases. Right now, liquidity is thin and confidence remains fragile, leaving room for further downside or prolonged consolidation. This is not a clear “buy the dip” moment for the overall market. Caution and patience are still the better strategy, with selective accumulation only where strong fundamentals and on-chain support clearly justify it.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) also suffers the same fate, dipping to the $0.000005 price level. According to CoinGecko data, SHIB’s price is down 9.2% in the last 24 hours , 17.7% in the last week, nearly 26% in the 14-day charts, and 34.7% over the previous month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are distraught, wondering if the asset’s price is at its bottom, or will it crash further. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Is Shiba Inu’s Price At Its Bottom, Or Is More Bad News On The Way? Source: WatcherGuru Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at levels last seen in July 2021. Investors are sitting on heavy losses, especially those who bought the asset at the top. SHIB’s price is currently following Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory, and may not rebound until the original crypto registers some positive price action. Some analysts anticipate BTC to fall further. Stifel anticipates BTC’s price to dip to the $38,000 level. BTC falling to $38,000 could pull Shiba Inu (SHIB) further down. However, the market seems to be making a slight rebound today. Although the rebound may see a rejection, it could also signal a bottom. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently hangs on a thread. The market-wide crash comes amid tighter Federal Reserve policies and a shrinking liquidity crisis. Macroeconomic worries and geopolitical tensions have added further fuel to the fire. Additionally, market participants took a risk-off approach with their investments. Shiba Inu (SHIB) being a memecoin carries some of the highest risks in the market. Memecoins will likely take much longer to recover than other cryptocurrencies. Also Read: New Shiba Inu Price Prediction Says SHIB May Hit $0.0004: Here’s When Given the uncertain environment and the bearishness that looms over the market, it is unclear if Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at its bottom, or if the asset’s price sill fall further. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) does not recover from its depths, SHIB will likely face additional sell pressure.16:T635,The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to extreme fear levels of 5-9, the lowest since the June 2022 Terra and FTX crashes, as Bitcoin briefly dropped below $65,000 before recovering. The cryptocurrency saw a single-day decline of over $10,000, wiping out significant market value and triggering widespread liquidations. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $434.1 million in net outflows on February 5, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, reflecting growing caution among institutional investors.

The memecoin's price trajectory is closely following Bitcoin (BTC), which has fallen to the $62,000 mark, with some analysts predicting BTC could drop further to $38,000.\n\nThe market-wide downturn is attributed to tighter Federal Reserve policies, a shrinking liquidity crisis, macroeconomic worries, and geopolitical tensions. While there's a slight market rebound, it remains uncertain if this signals a bottom. As a memecoin, SHIB carries higher risks and may take longer to recover than other cryptocurrencies.
