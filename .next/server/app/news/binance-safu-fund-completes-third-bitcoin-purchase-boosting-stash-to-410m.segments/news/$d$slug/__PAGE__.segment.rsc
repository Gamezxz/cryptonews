4:T4a1,The latest conversion comes after the team completed its second acquisition on Wednesday. Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) purchased an additional 3,600 Bitcoin for approximately $233 million on Friday, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 6,230 BTC valued at around $410 million at current market prices, according to on-chain data . Binance targets converting $1 billion of stablecoin reserves in the SAFU fund into Bitcoin in 30 days. The company surpassed 40% of its goal in four days. SAFU, established in July 2018 following a security breach, functions as an emergency reserve to protect user assets in the event of hacks or exchange issues. The fund reached $1 billion in value by January 2022, funded through allocations from trading fees. Binance announced the strategic shift to Bitcoin holdings on January 30, citing transparency, auditability, and inflation hedging as primary motivations. The conversion process began on February 2 with an initial purchase of 1,315 BTC for over $100 million. The exchange has committed to restoring SAFU to $1 billion if its value falls below $800 million. The fund currently safeguards assets for over 300 million users.0:{"buildId":"zKSZAfG-4mv0nzeam6zBH","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985d690625325b57c4c5298","guid":"https://cryptobriefing.com/?p=189418","slug":"binance-safu-fund-completes-third-bitcoin-purchase-boosting-stash-to-410m","title":"Binance SAFU Fund completes third Bitcoin purchase, boosting stash to $410M","link":"https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-safu-fund-bitcoin-increase/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:46:17.000Z","content":"Binance's SAFU fund's Bitcoin acquisition strategy enhances user asset protection and reflects a shift towards more transparent, auditable reserves.\nThe post Binance SAFU Fund completes third Bitcoin purchase, boosting stash to $410M appeared first on Crypto Briefing.","author":"Vivian Nguyen","enclosure":"https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06064526/7ced48c7-8893-43f7-883a-1a17adb70f70-400x210.jpg","source":"Crypto Briefing","sourceCategory":"general","category":"bitcoin","categories":["bitcoin"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"","translatedContent":"","sentiment":"","fullContent":"$4","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":187,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T11:54:56.446Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T11:54:56.450Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:58:13.637Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6985d692625325b57c4c5406","slug":"metaplanet-to-keep-buying-bitcoin-despite-market-slump","title":"Metaplanet to Keep Buying Bitcoin Despite Market Slump","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:49:40.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":""},{"_id":"6985d3eaca279254f3ba941e","slug":"ark-offloads-17-million-of-coinbase-adds-18-million-of-bullish-amid-crypto-rout","title":"ARK offloads $17 million of Coinbase, adds $18 million of Bullish amid crypto rout","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:42:40.000Z","source":"CoinDesk","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"ARK ขาย Coinbase มูลค่า 17 ล้านดอลลาร์ ซื้อ Bullish เพิ่ม 18 ล้านดอลลาร์ ในช่วงการแพนิกในตลาดคริปโต"},{"_id":"6985d3edca279254f3ba96c8","slug":"bitcoin-crash-sends-ethereum-and-major-altcoins-into-oversold-territory","title":"Bitcoin Crash Sends Ethereum and Major Altcoins Into Oversold Territory","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:38:32.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"การร่วงของ Bitcoin ส่งผลให้ Ethereum และ Altcoin หลักเข้าสู่ภาวะขายลงเกินไป"},{"_id":"6985d3ecca279254f3ba9592","slug":"strategy-reports-174-billion-q4-operating-loss-amid-bitcoin-price-correction","title":"Strategy Reports $17.4 Billion Q4 Operating Loss Amid Bitcoin Price Correction","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:30:53.000Z","source":"Bitcoin.com","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Strategy รายงานขาดทุนดำเนินงาน Q4 17.4 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ในช่วงการปรับตัวลงของราคา Bitcoin"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
