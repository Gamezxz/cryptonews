4:T4a1,The latest conversion comes after the team completed its second acquisition on Wednesday. Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) purchased an additional 3,600 Bitcoin for approximately $233 million on Friday, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 6,230 BTC valued at around $410 million at current market prices, according to on-chain data . Binance targets converting $1 billion of stablecoin reserves in the SAFU fund into Bitcoin in 30 days. The company surpassed 40% of its goal in four days. SAFU, established in July 2018 following a security breach, functions as an emergency reserve to protect user assets in the event of hacks or exchange issues. The fund reached $1 billion in value by January 2022, funded through allocations from trading fees. Binance announced the strategic shift to Bitcoin holdings on January 30, citing transparency, auditability, and inflation hedging as primary motivations. The conversion process began on February 2 with an initial purchase of 1,315 BTC for over $100 million. The exchange has committed to restoring SAFU to $1 billion if its value falls below $800 million. The fund currently safeguards assets for over 300 million users.0:{"buildId":"Lop84034c2cxeM48hSGQq","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985d690625325b57c4c5298","guid":"https://cryptobriefing.com/?p=189418","slug":"binance-safu-fund-completes-third-bitcoin-purchase-boosting-stash-to-410m","title":"Binance SAFU Fund completes third Bitcoin purchase, boosting stash to $410M","link":"https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-safu-fund-bitcoin-increase/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:46:17.000Z","content":"Binance's SAFU fund's Bitcoin acquisition strategy enhances user asset protection and reflects a shift towards more transparent, auditable reserves.\nThe post Binance SAFU Fund completes third Bitcoin purchase, boosting stash to $410M appeared first on Crypto Briefing.","author":"Vivian Nguyen","enclosure":"https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06064526/7ced48c7-8893-43f7-883a-1a17adb70f70-400x210.jpg","source":"Crypto Briefing","sourceCategory":"general","category":"bitcoin","categories":["bitcoin"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"กองทุน Binance SAFU ทำการซื้อ Bitcoin ครั้งที่สามเสร็จสิ้น เพิ่มสำรองเป็น 410 ล้านดอลลาร์","translatedContent":"กลยุทธ์การซื้อ Bitcoin ของกองทุน SAFU ของ Binance ช่วยเพิ่มความปลอดภัยให้กับทรัพย์สินของผู้ใช้และสะท้อนถึงการเปลี่ยนแปลงไปสู่ทุนสำรองที่โปร่งใสและสามารถตรวจสอบได้มากขึ้น","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$4","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":187,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T11:54:56.446Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T11:54:56.450Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T06:03:02.878Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6986d59638f2116917d8f818","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T06:00:38.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-is-maras-87m-btc-move-more-evidence-of-miner-distress","source":"AMBCrypto","title":"Bitcoin – Is MARA’s $87M BTC move more evidence of miner distress?","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin – การย้าย BTC มูลค่า 87 ล้านดอลลาร์ของ MARA เป็นหลักฐานของความวิบัติของเหมืองหายใช่ไหม?"},{"_id":"6986d52438f2116917d8e575","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T06:00:03.000Z","slug":"bitcoin-whale-inflows-to-binance-hit-highest-level-since-2022-distribution-or-re","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Bitcoin Whale Inflows To Binance Hit Highest Level Since 2022: Distribution Or Repositioning?","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin Whale Inflows To Binance Hit Highest Level Since 2022: Distribution Or Repositioning?"},{"_id":"6986d04138f2116917d89c09","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:54.000Z","slug":"google-search-volume-for-bitcoin-skyrockets-amid-btc-price-swings","source":"Cointelegraph","title":"Google search volume for 'Bitcoin' skyrockets amid BTC price swings","translatedTitle":"ปริมาณการค้นหา 'Bitcoin' บน Google พุ่งสูงสุดขึ้นเมื่อราคา BTC ผันผัน"},{"_id":"6986d16c38f2116917d8b420","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-07T05:30:00.000Z","slug":"xrp-still-in-bull-market-versus-bitcoin-and-xrpbtc-chart-puts-51-upside-on-the-m","source":"U.Today","title":"XRP Still in Bull Market Versus Bitcoin, and XRP/BTC Chart Puts 51% Upside on the Menu","translatedTitle":"XRP ยังอยู่ในตลาดเพชรฟองต่อบิทคอยน์ และแผนภูมิ XRP/BTC มีศักยภาพเพิ่มขึ้น 51%"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
