4:T4a1,The latest conversion comes after the team completed its second acquisition on Wednesday. Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) purchased an additional 3,600 Bitcoin for approximately $233 million on Friday, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 6,230 BTC valued at around $410 million at current market prices, according to on-chain data . Binance targets converting $1 billion of stablecoin reserves in the SAFU fund into Bitcoin in 30 days. The company surpassed 40% of its goal in four days. SAFU, established in July 2018 following a security breach, functions as an emergency reserve to protect user assets in the event of hacks or exchange issues. The fund reached $1 billion in value by January 2022, funded through allocations from trading fees. Binance announced the strategic shift to Bitcoin holdings on January 30, citing transparency, auditability, and inflation hedging as primary motivations. The conversion process began on February 2 with an initial purchase of 1,315 BTC for over $100 million. The exchange has committed to restoring SAFU to $1 billion if its value falls below $800 million. The fund currently safeguards assets for over 300 million users.0:{"buildId":"eP0p0h5FoOsbu-pLD2wdL","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985d690625325b57c4c5298","guid":"https://cryptobriefing.com/?p=189418","slug":"binance-safu-fund-completes-third-bitcoin-purchase-boosting-stash-to-410m","title":"Binance SAFU Fund completes third Bitcoin purchase, boosting stash to $410M","link":"https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-safu-fund-bitcoin-increase/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:46:17.000Z","content":"Binance's SAFU fund's Bitcoin acquisition strategy enhances user asset protection and reflects a shift towards more transparent, auditable reserves.\nThe post Binance SAFU Fund completes third Bitcoin purchase, boosting stash to $410M appeared first on Crypto Briefing.","author":"Vivian Nguyen","enclosure":"https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06064526/7ced48c7-8893-43f7-883a-1a17adb70f70-400x210.jpg","source":"Crypto Briefing","sourceCategory":"general","category":"bitcoin","categories":["bitcoin"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"กองทุน Binance SAFU ทำการซื้อ Bitcoin ครั้งที่สามเสร็จสิ้น เพิ่มสำรองเป็น 410 ล้านดอลลาร์","translatedContent":"กลยุทธ์การซื้อ Bitcoin ของกองทุน SAFU ของ Binance ช่วยเพิ่มความปลอดภัยให้กับทรัพย์สินของผู้ใช้และสะท้อนถึงการเปลี่ยนแปลงไปสู่ทุนสำรองที่โปร่งใสและสามารถตรวจสอบได้มากขึ้น","sentiment":"bullish","fullContent":"$4","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":187,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T11:54:56.446Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T11:54:56.450Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T13:20:44.281Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6985e84b51f3090f7cf87186","slug":"bitcoin-crashes-10-on-bithumb-after-staff-mistakenly-airdrop-2000-btc-to-users","title":"Bitcoin crashes 10% on Bithumb after staff mistakenly airdrop 2,000 BTC to users","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:06:23.000Z","source":"Crypto Briefing","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin ร่วง 10% บน Bithumb หลังพนักงาน airdrop BTC 2,000 เหรียญให้ผู้ใช้โดยความผิดพลาด"},{"_id":"6985e84a51f3090f7cf8706c","slug":"bitcoin-price-rebounds-11-to-65k-who-is-buying-the-dip","title":"Bitcoin price rebounds 11% to $65K: Who is buying the dip?","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:06:04.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"ราคา Bitcoin ดีดตัวกลับขึ้น 11% ถึง $65K: ใครกำลังซื้อตอนราคาตก?"},{"_id":"6985e72251f3090f7cf86ec0","slug":"altcoins-crash-deepens-as-fear-peaks-is-the-market-near-a-turning-point","title":"Altcoins Crash Deepens as Fear Peaks: Is the Market Near a Turning Point?","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:01:12.000Z","source":"Coinpedia","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"การแกว่งตัวลงของ Altcoins ลึกขึ้นเมื่อความกลัวพุ่งสูงสุด: ตลาดใกล้ถึงจุดเปลี่ยนแล้วหรือไม่?"},{"_id":"6985e60751f3090f7cf869b3","slug":"bitcoin-why-btcs-60k-drop-is-a-rare-black-swan-event","title":"Bitcoin: Why BTC’s 60K drop is a rare ‘Black Swan’ event","pubDate":"2026-02-06T13:00:16.000Z","source":"AMBCrypto","category":"bitcoin","translatedTitle":"Bitcoin: ทำไมการร่วงลงของ BTC สู่ระดับ 60K จึงถือเป็นเหตุการณ์ 'Black Swan' ที่หายาก"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
