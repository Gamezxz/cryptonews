4:T7ec,A wave of forced liquidations, ETF outflows, and collapsing miner economics pushed crypto sentiment to its darkest levels since 2022 as markets hunt for a bottom. Posted February 6, 2026 at 7:40 am EST. Crypto markets extended last week’s selloff into a full-blown capitulation, with sentiment hitting levels last seen during the 2022 collapse. As of 5:50 am ET , bitcoin was trading near $65,900 , after briefly plunging toward $60,000 , while ether fell to $1,920 and solana slid to $81 . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to 9 out of 100 , its lowest reading since the Terra meltdown. This story is an excerpt from the Unchained Daily newsletter .

Over the past 24 hours alone, roughly $2.6 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, the majority tied to long bets. Bitcoin also slipped below its 200-week exponential moving average , a level historically breached only during deep bear markets. From its October peak near $126,000, BTC is now down close to 50% . ETF flows reflect the stress. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs posted $434 million in net outflows on Feb. 5, led by $175 million exiting BlackRock’s IBIT , even as the fund saw a record $10 billion in daily trading volume . Ether ETFs lost another $81 million , while solana ETFs bucked the trend with modest inflows. Trading activity has surged amid the chaos. Perpetual DEXs recorded over $70 billion in daily volume , the second-highest day on record, trailing only the October 10 flash crash. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap has fallen to roughly $2.3 trillion , with more than $1 trillion erased since mid-January. Pressure is also mounting beneath the surface. Bitcoin mining profitability has collapsed, with hash price falling to a record low near $0.03 per terahash , squeezing miners already facing higher power costs. Together, the data paints a picture of forced selling, thin liquidity, and a market still searching for a durable floor.0:{"buildId":"nyNMduq-QDcIzXqHG9EwS","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"698640084007f0a6ec7f19b7","guid":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/?p=40705","slug":"crypto-capitulation-deepens-as-prices-slide-to-multi-year-lows","title":"Crypto Capitulation Deepens as Prices Slide to Multi-Year Lows","link":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/crypto-capitulation-accelerates-as-2-6-billion-in-liquidations-rock-markets/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T12:40:11.000Z","content":"The post Crypto Capitulation Deepens as Prices Slide to Multi-Year Lows appeared first on Unchained.","author":"Editorial","enclosure":"https://unchainedcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fear-and-Greed-index.png","source":"Unchained","sourceCategory":"general","category":"general","categories":["general"],"summary":"","translatedTitle":"การขายถอดคริปโตรุนแรงขึ้นเมื่อราคาจมลงสู่จุดต่ำสุดในรอบหลายปี","translatedContent":"โพสต์ที่มีหัวข้อว่า การขายถอดคริปโตรุนแรงขึ้นเมื่อราคาจมลงสู่จุดต่ำสุดในรอบหลายปี ปรากฏขึ้นเป็นครั้งแรกที่ Unchained","sentiment":"bearish","fullContent":"$4","aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","keyPoints":[],"scrapingStatus":"scraped","wordCount":343,"fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.989Z","createdAt":"2026-02-06T19:24:56.989Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T22:10:14.682Z","__v":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"69865b1038f2116917d36185","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:16:52.000Z","slug":"analysts-see-400-upside-for-gemi-as-geminis-overseas-exit-may-speed-profitabilit","source":"The Block","title":"Analysts see 400% upside for GEMI as Gemini’s overseas exit may speed profitability","translatedTitle":"นักวิเคราะห์มองเห็นศักยภาพการเติบโต 400% ของ GEMI เมื่อการขยายตัวไปต่างประเทศของ Gemini อาจเร่งให้มีกำไรเร็วขึ้น"},{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d3380a","category":"general","pubDate":"2026-02-06T21:00:36.000Z","slug":"bitget-fan-club-sets-a-new-standard-for-community-in-crypto-1","source":"Bitcoin.com","title":"Bitget Fan Club Sets a New Standard for Community in Crypto","translatedTitle":"Bitget Fan Club ตั้งมาตรฐานใหม่สำหรับชุมชนในวงการ Crypto"},{"_id":"69864f874007f0a6ec7f61ca","slug":"ai-platform-founded-by-cryptocoms-kris-marszalek-launches-ai-agents","title":"AI platform founded by Crypto.com's Kris Marszalek launches AI agents","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:22:07.000Z","source":"Cointelegraph","category":"general","translatedTitle":"แพลตฟอร์ม AI ที่ก่อตั้งโดย Kris Marszalek จาก Crypto.com เปิดตัว AI agents"},{"_id":"69864d284007f0a6ec7f56e4","slug":"galaxy-digital-shares-jump-18-after-company-approves-200-million-buyback","title":"Galaxy Digital shares jump 18% after company approves $200 million buyback","pubDate":"2026-02-06T20:15:04.000Z","source":"CoinDesk","category":"general","translatedTitle":"หุ้น Galaxy Digital พุ่งขึ้น 18% หลังจากบริษัทอนุมัติการซื้อคืนหุ้นมูลค่า 200 ล้านดอลลาร์"}]}],"$L5"],["$L6"],"$L7"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
