4:T177a,In brief Predictors have swung overwhelmingly in favor of the bearish side of Myriad's "pump or dump" markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The odds swings over the last week correspond with the top crypto assets' major declines in recent days. Traders on Myriad believe the Seahawks have around a 69% chance of winning the Super Bowl this weekend. Crypto prices have seen no relief of late, with Bitcoin falling to a 15-month low and Ethereum’s losses extending to more than 60% off its August all-time high. Nevertheless, predictors on Myriad are still adamant that there will be no crypto winter . But they are less certain that BTC or ETH will move substantially up anytime soon. Below, we’ll look at some of this week’s top markets on the prediction market platform, including those centered on the next stops for Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with America’s biggest sporting event, the Super Bowl. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt’s parent company, Dastan.) Bitcoin’s next move: Pump to $84K or dump to $55K? Market Open: February 5 Market Close: Open until resolution Volume: $978 Link : See the latest odds on the "BTC's Next Move: Pump to $100K or Dump to $69K?" market on Myriad Crypto’s top asset by market cap plunged below $69,000 on Thursday morning, concluding Myriad’s long-standing pump-or-dump market that asked predictors whether $69,000 or $100,000 was the next stop for BTC. Odds on that market had swung as much as 60% in the last week, with predictors sliding to the side of a “dump” in that market. Now, as BTC extends its losses, down more than 22% in the last seven days and nearly 48% off its October all-time high of $126,080, a new market offers different “dump” and “pump” pillars: $55,000 or $84,000. In early trading, users remain bearish, giving 68% odds to a dump towards $55,000. That mark is around the 200-week moving average for BTC, a number that analysts believe could be in store given the asset’s structural weakness and lack of near-term catalysts. Bitcoin’s new 15-month lows have erased all the gains since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump took office as well, leaving only bears with any satisfaction in the last few months. BTC has dropped more than 11% in the last 24 hours, recently changing hands around $65,207. It will need to jump about 29% to hit $84,000 or drop 16% to “dump” to $55,000. What’s Next? Though analysts suggest there are no clear near-term catalysts, the next FOMC meeting in March could provide risk assets some relief if a rate cut is made. Ethereum’s next move: Pump to $3,000 or dump to $1,500? Market Open: February 2 Market Close: Open until resolution Volume: $7.75K Link : See the latest odds on the "Ethereum's Next Move: Pump to $3,000 or Dump to $1,500?" market on Myriad The market drawdown has not spared Ethereum, crypto’s second-largest asset by market cap. ETH has now fallen nearly 31% in the last week, diving below $2,000 for the first time since May 2025 and recently changing hands at $1,919. Predictors asked about its next move are decidedly bearish, as well, giving odds of a dump to $1,500 about a 71% chance as of Thursday afternoon. That represents around an 15% shift in odds towards the bearish side in the last week. Much like Bitcoin, the near-term catalysts for ETH are not apparent. BitMine Immersion Technologies continues to buy as its outspoken chairman Tom Lee maintains ambitious price predictions , but the firm’s unrealized losses now sit at about $8 billion . Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin has been selling as well, albeit to fund the future of Ethereum via the Ethereum Foundation, as he stressed the need for a “new path” for Ethereum layer-2 and scaling networks. Buterin has also moved funds to support his own charity, Kanro. While tokenization and Ethereum’s connection to it has been a major trend in the eyes of institutional leaders, investors in traditional markets have been pulling funds from Ethereum ETFs, which have seen $2.5 billion in outflows over the last 30 days, according to CoinGlass. Another 22% drop would bring this market to conclusion for those expecting an ETH “dump.” Meanwhile, ETH would need to jump around 56% to hit $3,000. What’s Next? ETH similarly could see relief should there be a rate cut at the Fed’s March 17-18 FOMC meeting. Who wins the Super Bowl? Market Open: February 2 Market Close: February 8 Volume: $3.94K Link : See the latest odds on the "Who wins the Super Bowl?" market on Myriad One of the world’s largest sporting spectacles will take place on Sunday, when the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots square off in Super Bowl LX. The game’s outcome and a variety of prop bets are expected to garner more than $1.75 billion in wagers this year, according to the American Gaming Association. Predictors on Myriad can also put their football knowledge to the test in a market that asks who will take home the Lombardi Trophy, presented to the winning team after the game. As of now, Myriad predictors are giving the Seattle Seahawks around a 69% chance of winning Super Bowl LX. That’s about half a percent higher than earlier this week, and equates to American sportsbook odds of -222. That mark is slightly lower than that offered by major American sportsbook DraftKings, which offers American odds of -230, or closer to a 70% chance for the Seahawks to win the game. At those odds, Myriad provides Seahawks backers with about a 1% edge to the traditional sportsbook (not including any fees). The two teams most recently met in the 2015 Super Bowl and provided a memorable finish, with the Patriots claiming a 28-24 victory after a game-saving interception was made in the game’s final seconds. Will the Seahawks claim revenge? Predictors seem to think so. What’s Next? The game will kickoff on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET.
