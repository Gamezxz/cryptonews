f:T1ac2,Predict.fun is actively transforming the landscape of decentralized prediction markets by introducing a dual-incentive model. It addresses the industry-wide “Idle Capital Problem” through a unique yield-generating architecture. With backing from YZi Labs and leadership from the former Head of Research at Binance, this dApp enables users to earn passive interest on their stakes while simultaneously wagering on market outcomes. This comprehensive guide details how to maximize your returns via the Predict.fun’s Points Farming Campaign. About Predict.fun About Predict.fun Predict.fun operates as a high-velocity prediction protocol native to the BNB Chain. Platforms like Polymarket, which dominated headlines during the 2024 election cycle, suffer from a key flaw: capital inefficiency. When users place a bet on traditional prediction markets, their capital sits idle in a smart contract for weeks or months. They miss the chance to earn yield on those assets while awaiting the result. Predict.fun solves this issue through its yield-bearing design. Traditional platforms lock funds in escrow where they stagnate, but Predict.fun changes this dynamic completely. The protocol automatically routes staked assets into established lending markets like Venus Protocol on the BNB Chain. In other words, while the smart contract waits for an election result or a sports score, the underlying capital still generates interest. Users retain full exposure to the upside of their bet while mitigating the opportunity cost of locking up funds for extended periods. Furthermore, the low gas fees on BNB Chain allow for high-frequency trading strategies that remain prohibitively expensive on Ethereum Mainnet. To find the best ways to qualify for Predict.fun airdrop, review the instructions in the Airdrop Guide section below. Backers Behind Predict.fun Predict.fun attracts significant professional investment and focuses on high-capacity trade execution alongside an easy-to-use design for everyday participants. By late 2025, the platform managed over $11 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and $100 million in Notional Volume, per Dune analyst @datadashboards. Notional Volume on @predictdotfun just crossed $100M! 2 days ago they also saw an ATH in transactions and users with 30K transactions and 6.15K Unique Users. Their TVL also just legged up to over $11M this morning 👀 pic.twitter.com/nW0clhnpkX — dash (@datadashboards) December 29, 2025 YZi Labs, a firm with deep ties to early-stage Binance Labs incubations, provided strategic funding. While the team keeps the exact valuation confidential, on-chain data and treasury movements point to a capitalization in the tens of millions. Moreover, the involvement of Dingalingts, the former Head of Research at Binance and the creator of PancakeSwap, signals a serious commitment to technical excellence. His track record of scaling PancakeSwap to billions in volume has accelerated trust among institutional players. In addition, Changpeng Zhao, most known as Binance founder CZ, featured Predict.fun on X on December 4, 2025, triggering a massive wave of retail liquidity. Predict.fun is ready to use on the Binance Wallet app. Source: Predict.fun Predict.fun Points Program Predict.fun kicked off its official Points Farming Campaign on December 16, 2025, which serves as the primary mechanism for any potential distribution of their tokens in the future, incentivizing users based on their advocacy, activity, and accuracy. The platform tracks users’ historical on-chain actions to distribute rewards. Those who engaged with specific platforms likely received “Reserved Points” at launch. To qualify, users must trade high volumes on Limitless, Opinion or Polymarket, actively trade meme coins on the BNB Chain; or show a history of Aster contract interactions. The platform’s dynamic reward system calculates base points for every $1 USD of trading volume. Additionally, traders can secure a 1.5x multiplier by maintaining a three-day winning streak and a 2x multiplier if they are liquidity providers of markets with high uncertainty. Learn how to earn free crypto in 2026 Predict.fun Airdrop Guide Eligibility for the Token Generation Event (TGE) requires users to convert “Reserved” points into “Active” points. Follow these steps: Step 1: Activate Your Wallet Visit the official Predict.fun site, sign up, and connect a compatible Web3 wallet. Predict.fun Airdrop Guide Learn more: Binance Exchange Full Guide – NFTevening If the system detects historical volume on other platforms, it displays a “Reserved Points” balance immediately. To unlock these, complete specific tasks: create a profile, deposit $10, tweet your referral link, verify your account, and execute trades. Step 2: Execute High-Precision Trades To maximize earning potential, focus on strategies that demonstrate genuine user behavior rather than bot activity. The system rewards “real” usage: Place Limit Orders: Acting as a Market Maker (MM) earns higher rewards. Hold Positions: Avoid instant churn. Holding positions longer boosts reward weight and prevents “sybil” detection. Maintain a Good Win Rate: Accuracy acts as a multiplier, significantly increasing total point accumulation. Positive PnL: Aim for a PnL of $100+ to demonstrate strategic trading skills. Be Early: Trading in the initial weeks secures “OG” status and helps you climb the leaderboard faster. Step 3: The Referral Engine Predict.fun utilizes a structured referral model to drive network growth. When invited peers execute trades, the referrer receives a 10% commission on their total point earnings. This does not reduce the rewards of the invitee. To encourage high-quality networking, the platform grants special “Point Boost” NFTs, which can unlock permanent multipliers for future airdrop allocations, to the most successful referrers. FAQ What Is Predict.fun? Operating on the BNB Chain, Predict.fun offers a high-velocity environment for betting on market outcomes.
