4:T415,U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated remarkable resilience despite Bitcoin's price decline of over 50% since October 2025. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the BTC held by these ETFs has only decreased by approximately 7%, from 1.362 million to 1.272 million BTC. Global BTC ETF holdings showed similar strength, dropping by just 4.8% from 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC over the same period, indicating that investors, primarily 'boomers', are holding firm despite market volatility.

Bitcoin recently fell to $60K for the first time since October 2024, though it slightly recovered to $65K at press time. While BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced a record trading volume of $10 billion alongside a 13% price drop, analysts are divided about whether the market has reached its bottom. Chris Burniske expects further downside to levels around $58K or $50K, while Bitfinex analysts suggest that without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any upward movement might only represent a lower high in a fragile market.5:Taef,กองทุน Bitcoin ETF ในสหรัฐอเมริกาได้แสดงความยืดหยุ่นอย่างน่าทึ่งแม้ในช่วงที่ราคา Bitcoin ลดลงกว่า 50% ตั้งแต่เดือนตุลาคม 2025 ตามที่ Eric Balchunas นักวิเคราะห์ ETF จาก Bloomberg ระบุ ปริมาณ Bitcoin ที่ถือโดยกองทุนเหล่านี้ลดลงเพียงประมาณ 7% เท่านั้น จาก 1.362 ล้านเหรียญเป็น 1.272 ล้านเหรียญ การถือครอง Bitcoin ETF ทั่วโลกก็แสดงความแข็งแกร่งในทำนองเดียวกัน โดยลดลงเพียง 4.8% จาก 1.50 ล้านเป็น 1.428 ล้านเหรียญ ซึ่งชี้ให้เห็นว่านักลงทุน ส่วนใหญ่เป็น "ผู้สูงอายุ" ยังคงถือหุ้นอย่างมั่นคงแม้ในช่วงที่ตลาดผันผวน

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the overall BTC held by the ETFs dropped by only about 7%. He viewed the holders, mainly boomers, as ‘diamond hands.’ “Bitcoin’s price is down 44% from October high, but the amount of BTC held by the ETFs is only down 6.6%. Boomer strong.” Source: X Before the October crash, the U.S spot BTC ETFs held a record high of 1.362 million BTC. This stash had since dropped to 1.272 million BTC by the 4th of February. Can ETFs withstand the pressure? When zoomed out to the global holdings of BTC ETFs (covering offerings in the U.S, E.U., Asia, and others), the same picture emerged. Over the same period, global BTC ETF holdings dropped by only 72,400 BTC from October’s high of 1.50 million to 1.428 million BTC. That’s only a 4.8% drop in BTC holdings. Source: BOLD report Put differently, the market fears and outflows in the past few weeks have not led to a massive drop in BTC held by ETFs. However, the asset extended its price decline over the past 24 hours, tagging $60K for the first time since October 2024. Although BTC price had moved up slightly to $65K at press time, there was still uncertainty about whether it had reached its final market bottom. Source: Bloomberg That said, the latest dump saw BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) post its record daily trading volume of $10 billion and its second-worst price drop 13%. For Balchunas , this was ‘brutal,’ further raising questions about the ETF buyers’ ability to remain resilient if markets go lower. Is $60K the market bottom? Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, a VC partner at Placeholder and former Ark Invest crypto lead, said the sub-$60K levels were of ‘interest’ but expected an extra downside. “Watching with interest, but not buying yet. Expect a bounce, but doubt the bloodletting is done.” Chris nailed the October market top and the ensuing drawdown. He had projected that the market could bottom near $58K or $50K (levels that aligned with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and on-chain cost basis. For their part, Bitfinex analysts appeared hopeful that the market was not in a better position to form a bottom after the price dropped below the previous cycle peak of $69K. But they also echoed Burniske’s caution, “Order books show most demand under $66k as support bids were hit or pulled. That can set up a relief bounce, but without stronger spot demand and ETF flows, any move risks being just a lower high in a fragile market.” Source: Bitfinex Final Thoughts BTC held by U.S spot ETFs has dropped by only 7% despite BTC’s +50% price decline since October 2025 Despite the extended dip to $60K-$65K zone, analysts appeared cautiously optimistic for a potential BTC bottom.7:Te62,Bitcoin briefly crashed toward $60,000 on February 6, wiping out over $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in 24 hours. That makes it the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Most outlets are blaming macro pressure and weak sentiment. But DeFi researcher CryptoNobler says the real issue is structural, and it has been building for months. According to CryptoNobler , Bitcoin no longer trades like a supply-and-demand asset. Derivatives have taken over price discovery entirely. “The moment supply can be synthetically created, scarcity is gone. And when scarcity is gone, price stops being discovered on-chain and starts being set in derivatives,” he stated. What Happened to Bitcoin’s 21 Million Hard Cap? The hard cap still exists on-chain. But Bitcoin’s original value proposition relied on two things: fixed supply and no rehypothecation. That framework broke the moment Wall Street layered cash-settled futures, perpetual swaps, options, ETFs, prime broker lending, wrapped BTC, and total return swaps on top of the chain. Bob Kendall , creator of PortfolioXpert and a technical analyst, backed the same argument. “Once you can synthetically manufacture the supply, the asset is no longer scarce, and once scarcity is gone, price becomes a derivatives game, not a supply-and-demand market,” he said. The Six-Layer BTC Problem CryptoNobler pointed to what he calls the Synthetic Float Ratio (SFR). The idea is simple: one real BTC can now simultaneously back an ETF share, a futures contract, a perpetual swap, an options delta, a broker loan, and a structured note. All at the same time. “That’s six claims on one coin. That is not a free market. That is a fractional-reserve price system wearing a Bitcoin mask,” he warned. He added that this is the same structural break that already happened to gold, silver, oil, and equities once derivatives took over those markets. Wall Street’s Playbook Both researchers described a cycle that keeps repeating: create unlimited paper BTC , short into rallies, force liquidations, cover at lower prices, and do it again. CryptoNobler called it “inventory manufacturing.” Today’s crash fits that pattern. Of the $2.6 billion in liquidations, over $2.1 billion came from long positions being force-closed. Derivatives markets led the selloff while spot activity stayed relatively calm. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Holders? Bitcoin is trading around $66,000 after bouncing from the $60,000 floor. The question now is how long this cycle continues before the market catches up.

Bitcoin price dropped nearly 8.6%, hovering near the $65,000 level, while Ethereum and major altcoins followed with sharp intraday losses. The intensity of the move points to more than routine profit-taking. With liquidations accelerating and sentiment collapsing into extreme fear, the ongoing crypto crash creates a dilemma among investors, one that forces traders and investors to confront a familiar question: Is this a buy-the-dip moment, or is patience still required? Liquidations Data Reveals Market Still Under Stress The key trigger of today’s crypto crash lies in derivatives data. More than $2.59 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, marking one of the most aggressive leverage flushes of the year. Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the bulk of forced closures, while altcoins experienced cascading liquidations as price levels failed in quick succession. At the same time, total open interest fell 10.1% to $95.77 billion, confirming that leverage is being removed, not repositioned. Such conditions typically reflect instability rather than balance. Markets tend to struggle to form durable bottoms while liquidation velocity remains elevated. Sentiment Hits Extreme Fear, But Capitulation Is Incomplete The Crypto market Fear & Greed Index plunged to 10, placing sentiment deep into Extreme Fear, a zone that historically precedes medium-term recoveries. However, structural signals remain mixed. Bitcoin exchange balances increased by 13,800 BTC, suggesting that selling pressure has not fully exhausted itself. Coins are still moving toward exchanges rather than being locked away by long-term holders. In previous market cycles, sustainable bottoms emerged after extreme fear persisted alongside declining exchange inflows, a condition that has not yet fully materialized. Bitcoin Price at $65K: A Decision Zone, Not a Confirmed Bottom Bitcoin’s drop toward the $65,000 region is now colliding with a signal that long-term market participants rarely ignore. The monthly stochastic oscillator has slipped into extreme oversold territory, a condition that has appeared only three times over the past decade. Each prior occurrence aligned with major bear market bottoms and the start of prolonged accumulation phases. However, history also shows this signal is not a timing trigger. In previous cycles, Bitcoin did not immediately reverse higher. Instead, price often spent weeks sometimes months moving sideways or making marginal new lows as leverage flushed out and sentiment reset. That dynamic matters today. While the long-term stochastic suggests downside may be structurally limited, short-term data still reflects stress. Open interest is falling, liquidations remain elevated, and exchange balances are rising, indicating that traders are still de-risking rather than rebuilding positions. In practical terms, this creates a split narrative. For long-horizon investors, conditions are beginning to resemble early accumulation zones. For short-term traders, volatility risk remains high until liquidation pressure eases and price stabilizes above key support. The signal argues that Bitcoin may be closer to a bottom than a top, but confirmation will require patience, not prediction. Final Thoughts: Right Time to Buy or Wait? The broader crypto market is showing classic stress signals, not clear bottoming behavior. Extreme fear readings, multi-billion-dollar liquidations, and declining open interest suggest forced deleveraging is still working its way through the system. While some assets are showing relative strength and selective accumulation, this looks more like rotation and positioning not a broad-based recovery. Historically, durable market bottoms form after volatility compresses and sellers exhaust, not during peak liquidation phases. Right now, liquidity is thin and confidence remains fragile, leaving room for further downside or prolonged consolidation. This is not a clear “buy the dip” moment for the overall market. Caution and patience are still the better strategy, with selective accumulation only where strong fundamentals and on-chain support clearly justify it.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) also suffers the same fate, dipping to the $0.000005 price level. According to CoinGecko data, SHIB’s price is down 9.2% in the last 24 hours , 17.7% in the last week, nearly 26% in the 14-day charts, and 34.7% over the previous month. Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are distraught, wondering if the asset’s price is at its bottom, or will it crash further. Let’s discuss. Source: CoinGecko Is Shiba Inu’s Price At Its Bottom, Or Is More Bad News On The Way? Source: WatcherGuru Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at levels last seen in July 2021. Investors are sitting on heavy losses, especially those who bought the asset at the top. SHIB’s price is currently following Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory, and may not rebound until the original crypto registers some positive price action. Some analysts anticipate BTC to fall further. Stifel anticipates BTC’s price to dip to the $38,000 level. BTC falling to $38,000 could pull Shiba Inu (SHIB) further down. However, the market seems to be making a slight rebound today. Although the rebound may see a rejection, it could also signal a bottom. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently hangs on a thread. The market-wide crash comes amid tighter Federal Reserve policies and a shrinking liquidity crisis. Macroeconomic worries and geopolitical tensions have added further fuel to the fire. Additionally, market participants took a risk-off approach with their investments. Shiba Inu (SHIB) being a memecoin carries some of the highest risks in the market. Memecoins will likely take much longer to recover than other cryptocurrencies. Also Read: New Shiba Inu Price Prediction Says SHIB May Hit $0.0004: Here’s When Given the uncertain environment and the bearishness that looms over the market, it is unclear if Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at its bottom, or if the asset’s price sill fall further. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) does not recover from its depths, SHIB will likely face additional sell pressure.0:{"buildId":"5E2iouHbDFAwhxqVPNTuT","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"69859eaa38f2116917c2b170","guid":"https://u.today/bitwise-advisor-explains-enormous-crypto-crash","__v":0,"author":"Alex Dovbnya","categories":["bitcoin","altcoins"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Bitwise advisor Jeff Park has identified \"institutional risk management\" as the primary engine behind Bitcoin’s (BTC) collapse to an intraday low of $60,008.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T07:56:26.193Z","enclosure":"https://u.today/sites/default/files/styles/twitterwithoutlogo/public/2026-02/64323.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T07:56:26.193Z","link":"https://u.today/bitwise-advisor-explains-enormous-crypto-crash","pubDate":"2026-02-06T07:44:28.000Z","sentiment":"bearish","source":"U.Today","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"Jeff Park ที่ปรึกษาจาก Bitwise ระบุว่า \"การบริหารความเสี่ยงของสถาบ","title":"Bitwise Advisor Explains Enormous Crypto Crash ","translatedContent":"ที่ปรึกษาของ Bitwise Jeff Park ได้ระบุว่า 'การจัดการความเสี่ยงในสถาบัน' เป็นปัจจัยหลักเบื้องหลังการทรุดตัวของ Bitcoin (BTC) ลงสู่ระดับต่ำสุดรายวันที่ $60,008","translatedTitle":"ที่ปรึกษา Bitwise อธิบายการทรุดตัวครั้งใหญ่ของ Crypto","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:00:42.908Z"},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"6985c9da38f2116917ca5ad1","guid":"https://ambcrypto.com/?p=568132","__v":0,"aiSummary":"$4","aiSummaryThai":"$5","author":"Benjamin Njiri","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum","regulation"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"It wasn't clear whether the $60K could be BTC's market bottom.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T11:00:42.384Z","enclosure":"https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BitcoinETFFIfinal.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T11:00:42.384Z","fullContent":"$6","keyPoints":["U.S. Bitcoin ETF holdings decreased by only 7% despite Bitcoin's +50% price decline","Global Bitcoin ETF holdings dropped by just 4.8%, showing investor resilience","Bitcoin recently fell to $60K for the first time since October 2024","BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF experienced record trading volume of $10 billion with a 13% price drop","Analysts are divided on whether Bitcoin has reached its market bottom, with some expecting further downside to $58K or $50K"],"link":"https://ambcrypto.com/only-6-6-down-are-bitcoin-etfs-under-stress-amid-price-crash/","pubDate":"2026-02-06T11:00:07.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"bearish","source":"AMBCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"‘Only 6.6% down’: Are Bitcoin ETFs under stress amid price crash?","translatedContent":"ไม่ชัดเจนว่า $60K จะเป็นจุดต่ำสุดของตลาด BTC หรือไม่","translatedTitle":"'ลดลงเพียง 6.6%': Bitcoin ETFs กำลังถูกกดดันหรือไม่ในช่วงที่ราคาตก?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:03:20.871Z","wordCount":486},{"_id":"6985c64f38f2116917ca2d79","guid":"https://coinpedia.org/?p=541891","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Bitcoin recently crashed toward $60,000, wiping out $2.6 billion in leveraged positions in the worst single-day drop since the FTX collapse.

Without Bitcoin's recovery, SHIB will likely face additional selling pressure, making it unclear whether the asset has reached its bottom or will crash further.","aiSummaryThai":"ตลาดคริปโตกำลังเผชิญกับความตื่นตระหนกอย่างหนัก โดย Shiba Inu (SHIB) ร่วงลงถึงระดับ $0.000005 ซึ่งเป็นระดับที่ไม่เคยเห็นมาตั้งแต่เดือนกรกฎาคม 2021 SHIB ได้สูญเสียมูลค่าไปอย่างมีนัยสำคัญ ลดลง 9.2% ใน 24 ชั่วโมงที่ผ่านมา, 17.7% ในช่วงสัปดาห์ที่แล้ว, เกือบ 26% ในช่วง 14 วัน และ 34.7% ในเดือนที่ผ่านมา ราคาของเหรียญนี้เคลื่อนไหวตาม Bitcoin (BTC) ซึ่งร่วงลงมาถึงระดับ $62,000 โดยนักวิเคราะห์บางคนคาดการณ์ว่า BTC อาจจะร่วงลงไปถึง $38,000\n\nการร่วงลงของตลาดอย่างกว้างขวางเกิดจากนโยบายที่เข้มงวดขึ้นของ Federal Reserve, วิกฤตสภาพคล่องที่ลดลง, ความกังวลทางเศรษฐกิจมหภาค และความตึงเครียดทางภูมิรัฐศาสตร์ แม้ว่าตลาดจะมีการฟื้นตัวเล็กน้อย แต่ก็ยังไม่แน่ชัดว่านี่คือสัญญาณของจุดต่ำสุดหรือไม่ เนื่องจาก SHIB เป็นเหรียญ Meme จึงมีความเสี่ยงสูงกว่าและอาจใช้เวลาในการฟื้นตัวนานกว่าคริปโตสกุลอื่นๆ หาก Bitcoin ไม่ฟื้นตัว SHIB น่าจะเผชิญกับแรงขายเพิ่มเติม ทำให้ไม่ชัดเจนว่าสินทรัพย์นี้ได้ถึงจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือยังคงร่วงลงต่อไป","author":"Paigambar Mohan Raj","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Panic has gripped the crypto market as Bitcoin (BTC) fell to the $62,000 mark earlier today, Feb. 6,…","createdAt":"2026-02-06T10:45:34.904Z","enclosure":"https://watcher.guru/news/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-12.35.57-PM-1024x663.png","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T10:45:34.904Z","fullContent":"$9","keyPoints":["Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced significant losses, dropping to $0.000005 with declines of 9.2% in 24 hours and 34.7% over the past month.","SHIB is following Bitcoin's price trajectory and may not recover until BTC shows positive movement, with some analysts predicting BTC could fall to $38,000.","Market-wide downturn attributed to tighter Fed policies, liquidity crisis, and geopolitical tensions, with uncertainty whether SHIB has reached its bottom or will fall further."],"link":"https://watcher.guru/news/is-shiba-inu-at-its-bottom-or-will-shibs-price-crash-further","pubDate":"2026-02-06T10:33:00.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"bearish","source":"WatcherGuru","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"Is Shiba Inu At Its Bottom, Or Will SHIB’s Price Crash Further?","translatedContent":"ความตื่นตระหนกได้ครอบงำตลาดคริปโตเมื่อ Bitcoin (BTC) ลดลงสู่ระดับ $62,000 ในช่วงต้นวันนี้ 6 กุมภาพันธ์...","translatedTitle":"Shiba Inu ถึงจุดต่ำสุดแล้วหรือไม่? หรือราคา SHIB จะร่วงหนักลงไปอีก?","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T11:00:42.805Z","wordCount":339}]}],"$La"],["$Lb"],"$Lc"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
