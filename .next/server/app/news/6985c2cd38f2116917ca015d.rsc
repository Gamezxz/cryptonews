f:T135b,Bitcoin’s recent fall has triggered one of the biggest loss-taking events in its history , illustrating how quickly market sentiment has shifted after months of strong gains. As prices dropped nearly 10% to around $64,000, Bitcoin hit its lowest level since late 2024. This sharp move pushed many investors to sell their holdings at a loss. Record Losses in a Single Day February 5 stood out as a major stress point for the market. On-chain analyst Murphy reported that realized losses reached about $3.2 billion in just one day—the highest daily total ever recorded. Realized losses reflect how much money investors actually lose when they sell below their buying price, making this a strong sign of panic selling. Murphy noted that this single-day loss was even larger than what was seen during major past crises, including the Terra-Luna collapse and the FTX bankruptcy . This highlights how severe and sudden the latest sell-off has been. Low Liquidity Made the Drop Worse The Kobeissi Letter added that the decline was not driven by fear alone. It also exposed weak market liquidity. Bitcoin’s market depth, the amount of money available to absorb large trades, is still more than 30% lower than its October high. With fewer buyers at key price levels, even moderate selling can cause sharp price drops. The last time market depth was this low was after the FTX collapse in 2022, showing that the market remains fragile during periods of heavy selling. No Clear Trigger Behind the Sell-Off Unlike previous crashes caused by major news events, this downturn did not have one obvious trigger. Murphy said that aside from a data adjustment issue in late 2025, the current loss numbers reflect real selling pressure. He also defended using dollar-based loss data, saying it better shows the financial and emotional stress investors feel during sharp declines. Extreme Price Volatility The Kobeissi Letter also pointed out another first: Bitcoin recorded a single-day drop of more than $10,000. Even during earlier high-liquidation events, prices did not fall this much in one day. This has led to speculation that a large leveraged trader was forced to exit, which likely accelerated the fall and exposed how risky large positions can be. How Much Lower Can Bitcoin Go? Crypto researcher Sherlock highlighted a long-term pattern in Bitcoin’s history. Each bear market has resulted in smaller losses than the previous one, as the asset has matured. Bitcoin fell about 93% in 2011 and around 77% in 2022. If this trend continues, the current cycle could see a drop of roughly 70% from the $126,000 peak, pointing to a possible bottom near $38,000. This outlook suggests that while the recent sell-off has been painful, it may not be the final low and a quick recovery should not be taken for granted. Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World! Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. FAQs Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin is down due to low market liquidity and forced selling from leveraged positions. With fewer buyers, sell orders moved prices sharply lower. How big were the losses in the recent Bitcoin sell-off? On February 5, investors realized losses of roughly $3.2 billion in a single day—the highest daily loss ever recorded, exceeding losses seen during the Terra-Luna and FTX collapses. Could Bitcoin’s price drop further from here? Based on historical bear market patterns, Bitcoin could potentially fall around 70% from its $126,000 peak, suggesting a possible bottom near $38,000, though market conditions remain fluid. Was there a specific event that caused Bitcoin’s latest sell-off? No single news event triggered it. The drop appears driven by market structure, leverage unwinding, and fragile liquidity conditions.

Feb 6, 2026, 11:14 a.m. IREN (IREN) earnings showed weaker than expected headline results, with the company missing consensus on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as it accelerates its transition from bitcoin mining to AI Cloud. Financially, Q2 revenue declined to $184.7 million, missing expectations and down from $240.3 million in Q1, while the company reported a net loss of $155.4 million, also below consensus. STORY CONTINUES BELOW IREN secured $3.6 billion of GPU financing for its Microsoft contract which together with a $1.9 billion customer prepayment is expected to cover around 95% of GPU related capex. Tech giant Amazon (AMZ) also missed expectations on EPS but beat on revenue , according to investing.com. Investor focus shifted to management’s plan to spend around $200 billion on capex in 2026, primarily AI related. Amazon shares are down 10%. Pre-market update Bitcoin rebounded from around $60,000 to $66,000, driving a broad rally across crypto exposed equities. Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin, rose 7% in pre-market trading, mirroring a 7% gain for Galaxy (GLXY) and MARA Holdings (MARA) while Coinbase (COIN) increased by 6%.11:T673,Cardano founder and former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson revealed in a livestream called Red Days that his crypto holdings have lost over 3 billion dollars as Bitcoin fell below 66,000 and ADA dropped to 0.25, down 92 percent from its 2021 peak. Hoskinson stressed his commitment to blockchain technology over profit, saying money is not his motivation, and he would stay dedicated even after such losses. He highlighted his clean record compared to scandals like FTX and urged the community to keep building despite market volatility.

The bold strategy was seen as risky at one point, as the leading cryptocurrency is known for its extreme volatility. While using money from your own account is one thing, taking personal loans takes it to a whole different level. Bitcoin is not for the faint-hearted, as a crash can erase all profits in a jiffy. I n a recent Reddit post, the user highlighted that he purchased BTC using personal loans at an average price of $35,000 over four years. In total, the trader accumulated 4.75 BTC using this innovative method. However, he continued to repay the loans with funds from his day job.

Source: Shutterstock / In Green, modified by Blockworks At the time of the Reddit post, Bitcoin was trading at $76,000 level on Thursday and began attracting attracting bearish sentiments. Moreover, the trader’s wallet had ballooned to $356,000 early February 2026. That’s an unrealized profit of approximately 113% in just four years. This makes the risk worth it as his investment has more than doubled in value. The investor also revealed that he’ll be throwing in more money each month if Bitcoin dips below $70,000. He called it the perfect buying opportunity again, despite still paying off his personal loans to acquire BTC. The risk-to-reward ratio is extremely high in this scenario, but it has paid off handsomely. BTC experienced a major crash on Friday falling to the $65,000 level. The trader also revealed that he plans to take another $50,000 in personal loans if Bitcoin falls further in value. “In the meantime, I’m throwing everything I can at it each month while we’re in the $70-80k range with earned income from my job. I’ve been stacking this whole time while paying down the loans,” he wrote. Note: The post was made on Reddit, and Watcher Guru could not independently verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin holder.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"6985c2cd38f2116917ca015d","guid":"https://coinpedia.org/?p=541884","__v":0,"author":"Nidhi Kolhapur","categories":["bitcoin"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"The post Bitcoin Crash Triggers Biggest One-Day Investor Losses in History appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News\nBitcoin’s recent fall has triggered one of the biggest loss-taking events in its history, illustrating how quickly market sentiment has shifted after months of strong gains.
