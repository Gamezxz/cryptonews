Source: TradingView/MEXC What Is Zano Zano is a privacy-focused blockchain launched in 2019 by one of the original Monero core contributors. It uses two security methods, proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, to protect its network. Unlike Monero, which handles private payments only, Zano also supports Confidential Assets, a feature that lets other projects create privacy-protected tokens on its chain. The project has integrated with Cake Wallet and Bitcoin.com Wallet. A 2025 partnership with DFX also enables spending ZANO at over 100 SPAR supermarkets in Switzerland . Project Developments The team has released its 2026 roadmap outlining a series of major protocol upgrades focused on privacy, interoperability, and network resilience. The plan includes Hard Forks 6 and 7, which will introduce Gateway Addresses, a full upgrade to Proof-of-Stake consensus, and native ZANO integration on the Confidential Layer Bridge, enabling cross-chain transfers while preserving transaction confidentiality. Zano releases its 2026 roadmap, outlining major upgrades such as hard forks 6 & 7, bringing Gateway Addresses, a Full Proof-of-Stake consensus upgrade, Native $ZANO integration on the Confidential Layer Bridge, and much more! 🔒 Full roadmap available here:… pic.twitter.com/jxYYywT12f — Zano (@zano_project) January 8, 2026 ZANO has attracted public support from Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin investor and Bitcoin Cash advocate. Ver has discussed the project in interviews and on social media, citing founder Andrey Sabelnikov's background as one of the original CryptoNote developers, the privacy protocol that Monero later forked from. Ver was an early proponent of larger Bitcoin block sizes and later backed Bitcoin Cash following the 2017 fork. Market Conditions The Fear & Greed Index dropped to 9 on Feb. 6, classified as extreme fear, down from 16 one week prior, according to Alternative.me.

Bitcoin accounted for $1.35 billion, Ethereum for $565.44 million, and Solana for $188.44 million of total liquidations. Source: Coinglass Token Context Data from the project showed approximately 70% of ZANO ‘s 15.14 million circulating supply was staked, meaning those tokens are locked into the network rather than available for trading as of August 2025. The project's December 2025 update reported that total value locked, a measure of assets deposited across the network's applications, had crossed $18 million. A 2026 roadmap includes a network security upgrade and a lightweight wallet launch. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored post. CryptoSlate does not endorse any of the projects mentioned in this article.
