f:T91c,Ethereum has set a new on-chain milestone by recording 2.88 million transactions in a single day, the highest in its history. The headline figure signals accelerating usage, while the underlying data reveal a complex shift in how the network is being used and evaluated. The surge follows the Fusaka and BPO updates, which improved efficiency and drove gas fees to historic lows. Average transaction costs have fallen to roughly $0.15, dramatically reducing the barrier to activity. However, that success has introduced unintended consequences. Active accounts have climbed beyond one million, but on-chain analysis indicates that nearly 80% of recent growth stems from systemic noise, including address poisoning attempts and low-value dust transfers. The data reveals a growing challenge for Ethereum as scalability improves: distinguishing meaningful economic activity from spam without undermining accessibility. This evolution is changing how network health is measured. From 2026 and beyond, raw transaction volume is no longer a sufficient benchmark. Attention is shifting toward data quality, resilience against abuse, and the network’s ability to preserve high signal usage as costs fall. Advertisement So, Ethereum may have won the scaling race, but it now faces a parallel test in maintaining activity standards. Meanwhile, roughly 30% of the total ETH supply is now staked, promoting Ethereum’s role in digital finance. With base staking yields compressing toward 2.84%, staking could become the go-to for risk-free rates in the crypto market. This improvement has increased institutional interest in restaking, with protocols such as EigenLayer extending Ethereum’s security to additional services. At the same time, Ethereum’s monetary value is shifting. With low fees limiting burn-driven scarcity, spot ETFs have absorbed more than $500 million in ETH over the past two weeks, outpacing new issuance. This institutional demand provides support, but also introduces sensitivity to macro flows. From a market perspective, ETH dropped 7.11% to about $2,060 in the past 24 hours, amid a 29% weekly decline. ETH’s price is testing the $2,200 level as a critical pivot for preserving mid-term structure. Reclaiming it could open the path toward $2,500 and $3,000, while failure risks a deeper move toward $1,600.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33850","guid":"https://zycrypto.com/?p=114627","__v":0,"aiSummary":"","aiSummaryThai":"","author":"Olivia Brooke","categories":["ethereum"],"category":"ethereum","content":"Ethereum has set a new on-chain milestone by recording 2.88 million transactions in a single day, the highest in its history.","createdAt":"2026-02-06T21:04:38.688Z","enclosure":"https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Russian-Banking-Giant-Sber-Adds-Ethereum-And-MetaMask-Support.jpg","fetchedAt":"2026-02-06T21:04:38.317Z","fullContent":"$f","keyPoints":[],"link":"https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-shatters-all-time-record-with-2-88-million-transactions-recorded-in-a-single-day/","pubDate":"2026-02-05T13:46:10.000Z","scrapingStatus":"scraped","sentiment":"bullish","slug":"ethereum-shatters-all-time-record-with-288-million-transactions-recorded-in-a-si","source":"ZyCrypto","sourceCategory":"general","summary":"","title":"Ethereum Shatters All-Time Record With 2.88 Million Transactions Recorded In A Single Day ‬","translatedContent":"อีเธอเรียมได้สร้างเกณฑ์บนเชนใหม่โดยบันทึกธุรกรรมได้ 2.88 ล้านครั้งในหนึ่งวัน ซึ่งเป็นจำนวนสูงที่สุดในประวัติศาสตร์","translatedTitle":"อีเธอเรียมทำสถิติใหม่ด้วยการบันทึกธุรกรรม 2.88 ล้านครั้งในหนึ่งวัน","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T00:03:47.793Z","wordCount":348,"translateRetries":0},"relatedArticles":[{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c3a","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-07T00:00:16.000Z","slug":"tether-bets-big-on-gold-with-150-million-investment-in-goldcom","source":"Bitcoinist","title":"Tether Bets Big On Gold With $150 Million Investment In Gold.com","translatedTitle":"เทเธอร์ลงทุนในทองคำอย่างใหญ่หลวงด้วยการลงทุน 150 ล้านดอลลาร์ใน Gold.com"},{"_id":"698681ba38f2116917d55c37","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-06T23:58:38.000Z","slug":"megaeth-unveils-token-buyback-and-tge-plan","source":"The Defiant","title":"MegaETH Unveils Token Buyback and TGE Plan","translatedTitle":"MegaETH เปิดเผยแผนการซื้อคืนโทเค็นและ TGE"},{"_id":"6986841238f2116917d57491","category":"ethereum","pubDate":"2026-02-06T23:46:45.000Z","slug":"ethereums-vitalik-buterin-goes-all-in-on-zcash-with-new-privacy-bet","source":"BeInCrypto","title":"Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin Goes All-In on Zcash With New Privacy Bet","translatedTitle":"วิตัลิก บึตีริน ผู้ริเริ่ม Ethereum ลงทุนอย่างเต็มที่ใน Zcash ด้วยเดิมพันใหม่ด้านความเป็นส่วนตัว"},{"_id":"69867be538f2116917d4edf5","category":"bitcoin","pubDate":"2026-02-06T23:37:52.000Z","slug":"ethereum-lets-go-of-the-rollup-story-here-are-the-6-tokens-that-benefit","source":"Unchained","title":"Ethereum Lets Go of the Rollup Story.
