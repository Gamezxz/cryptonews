f:T42f,On February 5, perpetual DEXs experienced their second-largest trading day in history, processing over $70 billion in volume amid a sharp deleveraging event impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Hyperliquid led the surge with $24.7 billion in volume, capturing a 31% market share, while Aster, edgeX, and Lighter followed with significant contributions of $11.5 billion, $8.7 billion, and $7.5 billion respectively. This activity trailed only the record volumes seen during the October 10, 2025 "1011" crash, yet demonstrated the growing capacity of DeFi infrastructure to handle massive volatility.

The market downturn saw BTC hover near $64,000 and ETH in the high $1,800s, driving traders to unwind positions on-chain. This event underscores a structural shift in the crypto market, where perpetual DEXs have evolved from a niche hedge into a primary venue for warehousing and unwinding leveraged risk. The successful handling of this volume shock indicates that directional positioning has increasingly migrated to decentralized platforms over the last 18 months.10:Te7d,Perpetual DEXs processed over $70B on Feb. 5, their second‑biggest day ever, as Hyperliquid, Aster, edgeX and Lighter absorbed a sharp BTC, ETH, SOL‑led deleveraging. Summary Per DeFiLlama, perp DEXs cleared $70B+ on Feb. 5, second only to the Oct. 10, 2025 “1011” crash that saw $19B in liquidations and sent BTC from $117,000 to $101,800. ​ Hyperliquid handled $24.699B (about 31% share) in 24 hours, Aster $11.553B (~14.6%), edgeX $8.675B (~11%), and Lighter $7.537B (~9.5%), with edgeX alone credited with $600B+ in cumulative volume and over $1B in OI. ​ As BTC hovered near $64,000, ETH in the high $1,800s, SOL around $79–80, and XRP near $1.37, perp DEXs proved to be a primary venue where leveraged crypto risk is warehoused and unwound. ​ Perpetual DEXs just printed their second-biggest day on record, turning a brutal sell-off into a stress test that DeFi largely passed. Volume shock and “1011” shadow According to DeFiLlama data, perp DEXs processed more than $70 billion in volume on Feb. 5, the second-highest daily tally in history and only behind the Oct. 10, 2025 “1011” flash crash. That earlier event saw over $19 billion in liquidations in a single day and sent Bitcoin from roughly $117,000 to $101,800, cementing “1011” as a structural stress event for crypto leverage. On Feb. 5, the pain was smaller but the pipes were busier. Hyperliquid led with roughly $24.7 billion in 24-hour volume, Aster followed at about $10–11.6 billion, edgeX cleared around $8.7 billion, and Lighter handled roughly $7.5–7.5+ billion, according to DeFiLlama ’s perp dashboard. Together, those four accounted for well over half of all perpetual DEX turnover. Per DeFiLlama’s breakdown , Hyperliquid captured about 31% of total perp DEX volume over the last 24 hours, with a 24-hour print of $24.699 billion and roughly $248.1 billion traded over 30 days. Aster posted about $11.553 billion in daily volume, up 112% on the day and representing roughly 14.6% of total perp flows. edgeX processed $8.675 billion (+66.3% daily) for nearly 11% share, while Lighter’s $7.537 billion (+86.9% daily) translated into about 9.5% of the market. These venues are increasingly driven by incentives and points programs, with edgeX for instance already credited with more than $600 billion in cumulative user trading volume and over $1 billion in open interest in recent campaigns. Volumes of this scale suggest a core mix of BTC, ETH and SOL perps, plus high-beta altcoin pairs that traders use to express directional and basis views; during sharp drawdowns, BTC-USD, ETH-USD and SOL-USD contracts typically dominate notional flow and liquidations, while long-tail pairs add convexity but less absolute size. Market backdrop and major coins Spot and perp flows met in a classic deleveraging move. Bitcoin traded near $64,000 on Feb. 6, down around 11–12% over 24 hours in some market snapshots. Ethereum hovered in the high $1,800s, after a multi-week slide from above $3,000 and with technicians now eyeing the $1,600–2,000 band as a key trading range. Solana changed hands around $79–80, off roughly 14% on the day, with a 24-hour range between about $70.6 and $92.8. XRP traded near $1.37, with a 24-hour low of $1.14 and high around $1.38. What this day signals The Feb. 5 spike shows perp DEXs are no longer a niche hedge; they are where a large chunk of leveraged crypto risk is now warehoused and unwound. Compared with “1011,” the latest sell-off generated less outright liquidation carnage but pushed structurally higher volumes through Hyperliquid, Aster, edgeX and Lighter, underscoring how much directional positioning has migrated on-chain in under 18 months.4:[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$Ld",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$Le",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33824","guid":"https://crypto.news/?p=14448652","__v":0,"aiSummary":"$f","aiSummaryThai":"ในวันที่ 5 กุมภาพันธ์ แพลตฟอร์ม Perpetual DEX มีปริมาณการซื้อขายรายวันสูงเป็นอันดับสองในประวัติศาสตร์ ด้วยมูลค่าการซื้อขายมากกว่า 70 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ขณะที่ตลาดกำลังอยู่ในภาวะ Deleveraging อย่างหนักสำหรับ Bitcoin, Ethereum และ Solana Hyperliquid เป็นผู้นำด้วยปริมาณการซื้อขาย 24.7 พันล้านดอลลาร์ ครองส่วนแบ่งตลาด 31% ตามมาด้วย Aster, edgeX และ Lighter ที่มีส่วนแบ่งสำคัญที่ 11.5, 8.7 และ 7.5 พันล้านดอลลาร์ตามลำดับ กิจกรรมนี้ถือเป็นรองเพียงแค่ปริมาณการซื้อขายที่เกิดขึ้นในเหตุการณ์ตลาดถล่ม \"1011\" เมื่อวันที่ 10 ตุลาคม 2025 แต่ก็สะท้อนให้เห็นถึงความสามารถของโครงสร้างพื้นฐาน DeFi ในการรองรับความผันผวนที่รุนแรง\n","author":"Andrew Folkler","categories":["bitcoin","ethereum","defi","regulation"],"category":"bitcoin","content":"Perpetual DEXs processed over $70B on Feb. 5, their second‑biggest day ever, as Hyperliquid, Aster, edgeX and Lighter absorbed a sharp BTC, ETH, SOL‑led deleveraging.
