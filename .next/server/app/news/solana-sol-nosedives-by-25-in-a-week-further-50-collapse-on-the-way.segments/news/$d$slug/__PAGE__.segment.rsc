4:Tb08,Is SOL headed toward $50? The cryptocurrency market seems to can’t catch a break lately, and numerous digital assets continue to chart painful losses. Solana (SOL) is among the poorest performers, with its price plunging by 25% in the past week alone. According to some market observers, the bears might be just stepping in. Major Collapse on the Horizon? Just hours ago, SOL tumbled to approximately $95, its lowest level since February 2024. As of this writing, it trades at around $96, which is a staggering decline from the all-time high of almost $300 registered nearly a year ago. Many industry participants are now concerned that the asset may experience a further decrease in the short term. Ali Martinez, for instance, predicted that SOL could nosedive to $74.11 and even $50.18. The analyst, going on X as curb.sol, outlined $100 as an “extremely important level” for the token. In their view, holding that zone could result in a new bull run to a fresh all-time high, whereas the opposite scenario might lead to a crash to roughly $50 sometime this year. For their part, Alex RT₿ assumed the price may retreat to $70-$80 if SOL breaks below the $90 support level. Any Chance for the Bulls’ Return? It is important to note that some analysts believe the current rates could present great buying opportunities. The one using the X handle, Lucky, told their almost two million followers that “if the market behaves well, this could be a smart entry.” You may also like: Bitcoin to $16 Trillion?

SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell well below 30, meaning the price has declined too much in a short period of time. Ratios under that level signal that SOL is oversold and due for a potential rally, whereas anything above 70 is seen as bearish territory.

This suggests that investors have shifted from centralized platforms to self-custody, thereby reducing immediate selling pressure.
