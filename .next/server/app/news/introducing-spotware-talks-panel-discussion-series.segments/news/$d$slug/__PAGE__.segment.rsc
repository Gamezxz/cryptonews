David Kimberley, a recognised forex media expert, will host the discussion. Subscribe to the Spotware YouTube channel so you don’t miss this discussion.
This panel examines how brokers can control risk in extreme market conditions. The speakers will share the proven ways to maintain steady processes while keeping trading conditions fair and consistent. Using real volatility scenarios, the session will outline the operational steps brokers can take to stay resilient when markets turn erratic. With gold trading in increasingly wide ranges and volatility remaining elevated, this discussion serves as a practical guide for brokers seeking to protect execution standards without constraining client activity.
Roman Snegirev, CMO at Spotware, said: “With the launch of ‘Spotware Talks’, we’re introducing a new, regular panel series on our YouTube channel – a format designed to support our clients through valuable, B2B-focused discussions. In each session, we bring senior industry professionals to the table to set out the operational realities of successful CFD businesses.”
