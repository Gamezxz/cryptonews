The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the cryptocurrency space, with a fast and secure blockchain that offers a distinct approach to transaction processing compared to Ethereum and other smart contract chains. It’s permission-only, meaning the blockchain is managed by private companies. Limiting what types of decentralised applications are allowed is what makes Hedera stand out from the rest. Having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, it is now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. Hedera has also recently ramped up its development activities for its ecosystem. Its ecosystem is strengthening, despite its capped price action. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price chart 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and discussions about SEC approved HBAR ETF would flood string liquidity. Many are intrigued that: Will the HBAR Price Reach $1? Let’s discuss this in our Hedera price prediction 2025 article. Hedera Price Today Cryptocurrency Hedera Token HBAR Price $0.0906 11.30% Market Cap $ 3,894,157,866.08 24h Volume $ 307,534,576.0111 Circulating Supply 43,003,138,665.2407 Total Supply 50,000,000,000.00 All-Time High $ 0.5701 on 16 September 2021 All-Time Low $ 0.0100 on 02 January 2020 Coinpedia’s HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR’s price fell to $0.105 by January 2026, despite having an ETF and direct access to institutional flows, due to low demand. If support holds at $0.075 to $0.080, a recovery rally may emerge in Q1 2026. However, falling below this level could raise investor concerns, while a price increase could encounter resistance at $0.1930, with further potential at $0.2835 and $0.4010. HBAR Price Prediction 2026: What’s Next for Hedera? The HBAR price has experienced a prolonged period of consolidation below $0.120, lasting nearly 2 years from 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. Then a rally in Q4 2024 pushed it to $0.4010. But by the end of 2025, it is back below $0.120, and by the end of January 2026, it has slipped to $0.105. Despite an ETF, the price is witnessing lower demand and consolidating at the lower border of a falling wedge. This setup looks promising if $0.100-$0.105 holds its support, which closely aligns with the pattern’s lower border. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2026, there’s optimism based on this pattern. Currently, a strong range-bound price action is witnessed. A successful recovery rally from this point would indicate robust demand and could signal a stronger upward move. On the other hand, entering below this price zone could also raise concerns among investors, as market fluctuations and investor sentiment may lead to uncertainty. But, if it really spikes, then $0.1930 is key resistance in the immediate term and beyond this, 2026 could revisit $0.2835, followed by $0.4010 high.
