10:Tbfb,Spotware launches “Spotware Talks” – a new panel discussion series on the company’s YouTube channel. The series will run regularly and deliver practical, B2B-focused discussions for brokers and prop firms, sharing deep expertise on running and growing a trading business in today’s market. The panels will feature senior executives discussing how they approach strategy, technology, risk and operations.
The first Spotware Talks panel, “Gold gone wild: brokers’ survival guide – managing risk under extreme market conditions”, will go live on 26 February at 17:00 (GMT+2). It will be valuable for specialists in dealing and risk management, as well as founders and executives at FX/CFD brokerages. The session will bring together Angus Walker, Global Head of Trading at IC Markets, and Drew Niv, Chief Strategy Officer at ATFX. With decades of combined experience, the guests will share practice-based perspectives on securing stable operations when markets become increasingly unpredictable. David Kimberley, a recognised forex media expert, will host the discussion. Subscribe to the Spotware YouTube channel so you don’t miss this discussion.
This panel examines how brokers can control risk in extreme market conditions. The speakers will share the proven ways to maintain steady processes while keeping trading conditions fair and consistent. Using real volatility scenarios, the session will outline the operational steps brokers can take to stay resilient when markets turn erratic. With gold trading in increasingly wide ranges and volatility remaining elevated, this discussion serves as a practical guide for brokers seeking to protect execution standards without constraining client activity.
Roman Snegirev, CMO at Spotware, said: “With the launch of ‘Spotware Talks’, we’re introducing a new, regular panel series on our YouTube channel – a format designed to support our clients through valuable, B2B-focused discussions. In each session, we bring senior industry professionals to the table to set out the operational realities of successful CFD businesses.”
You can become a part of the first discussion – submit your question. The invited experts will answer your questions during the session. Join us and learn how to stay afloat when market moves get unpredictable.

In this interview, Brendan explains the reasoning behind his position. He walks through the message he believes many firms avoid: that the current prop trading model is too dependent on fees, too loose on risk, and too confusing for retail audiences. We discuss why he thinks the model grew fast, why it may run into walls, and what he believes is needed for a cleaner, more responsible version of prop trading. This is Brendan at his frankest — sharp, grounded, and very clear about what changes are overdue.
