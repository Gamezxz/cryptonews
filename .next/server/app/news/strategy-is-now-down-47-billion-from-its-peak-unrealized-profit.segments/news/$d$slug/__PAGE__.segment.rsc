4:T9b6,Michael Saylor and Strategy have now lost close to $50 billion worth of unrealized profit from back when Bitcoin hit an All-Time High (ATH) of $126.5k in October 2025. The company is among the largest holders of the premier digital currency, with around 713,502 BTC in its wallets at an average purchase price of $76,052. The premier digital currency keeps plunging below $70k today, and the losses are piling up now. Saylor Remains Unfazed However, Saylor has, in his usual style, doubled down on Strategy’s Bitcoin HODLing policy and tweeted : Image Source: X Strategy’s buying average was quite lower till mid 2025, but it rose sharply following mega purchases by Saylor around its peak. He also splurged billion-dollar amounts in December and January when the index was struggling between $80k-$100k. However, nothing suggests that Saylor is going to liquidate anytime soon. Strategy’s Reserve Flashes Red In addition to missing out on $47 billion in profits, the company’s stash is in the negative for the first time in several years. The current unrealized loss run started this month when the crypto fell below its average purchase price of $76,502. The digital currency is already down 18% in the first week of February, with no signs of a reliable price floor. Major players such as BlackRock and other ETF issuers are recording hundreds of millions of dollars in daily losses. Advertisement Bitcoin to Bottom After Strategy Sells Last Satoshi-Peter Schiff Leading gold bug and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff tweeted : Image Source: X Schiff believes that Strategy’s major purchases drove Bitcoin’s price up by more than 550%. He predicts that BTC’s bottom will come after Strategy is forced to sell its last Satoshi and all its artificial gains are wiped out. However, Schiff’s take is inaccurate as Saylor has continued to add more BTC to Strategy’s coffers every month. He actually accelerated the process in the last few months when the price took a beating, so he hasn’t stopped buying yet, let alone selling. A Test for Saylor’s “Diamond Hands” Schiff and other Bitcoin critics now have an opportunity to criticize Saylor’s BTC buying spree over the years. Some would suggest that next time, Saylor should capitalize on some short-term gains and put the interests of shareholders above his personal mission. However, it is highly unlikely that Strategy CEO is going to stop with his purchases, let alone capitulate and sell it in the open market.0:{"buildId":"atmo8Ynd0Xo-3moLwCm-_","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","header",null,{"className":"site-header","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"header-inner","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/","className":"header-brand","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"header-logo","children":"C"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-text","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Cryptonews",["$","span",null,{"children":".in.th"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Crypto Intelligence Aggregator"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"header-status","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"status-dot"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"Live Feed Active"}]]}]]}]}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"article":{"_id":"6986576638f2116917d33842","guid":"https://zycrypto.com/?p=114652","__v":0,"aiSummary":"Strategy and Michael Saylor have lost nearly $47 billion in unrealized profit as Bitcoin plunged below $70k, reversing gains from its October 2025 ATH of $126.5k.
